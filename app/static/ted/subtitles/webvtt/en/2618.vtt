00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.296
When you come to TEDx,
you always think about technology,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.656
the world changing,
becoming more innovative.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.456
You think about the driverless.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.896
Everyone's talking
about driverless cars these days,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.016
and I love the concept
of a driverless car,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.536
but when I go in one, you know,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.480
I want it really slow,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.720
I want access to the steering wheel
and the brake, just in case.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.240
I don't know about you,
but I am not ready for a driverless bus.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.320
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.560
How about a driverless world?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.480
And I ask you that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.080
because we are increasingly in one.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.776
It's not supposed to be that way.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.576
We're number one,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.496
the United States is large and in charge.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.336
Americanization and globalization
for the last several generations

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.016
have basically been the same thing.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.856
Right? Whether it's
the World Trade Organization

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.216
or it's the IMF, the World Bank,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.076
the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.856
these were American institutions,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.496
our values, our friends, our allies,
our money, our standards.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.600
That was the way the world worked.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.176
So it's sort of interesting,
if you want to look at how the US looks,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.416
here it is.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.736
This is our view of how the world is run.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.576
President Obama has got the red carpet,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.416
he goes down Air Force One,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.976
and it feels pretty good,
it feels pretty comfortable.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.616
Well, I don't know how many of you
saw the China trip last week

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.696
and the G20.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.936
Oh my God. Right?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.616
This is how we landed

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.136
for the most important meeting
of the world's leaders in China.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.136
The National Security Advisor
was actually spewing expletives

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.976
on the tarmac --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.416
no red carpet,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.096
kind of left out the bottom of the plane

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.920
along with all the media
and everybody else.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.896
Later on in the G20,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440
well, there's Obama.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.696
(Laughter)

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.336
Hi, George.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.560
Hi, Norman.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.216
They look like they're
about to get into a cage match, right?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.336
And they did. It was 90 minutes long,
and they talked about Syria.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.256
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.016
He's increasingly calling the shots.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.656
He's the one willing to do stuff there.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.856
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.736
but it's not as if the Americans
are telling him what to do.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.096
How about when the whole 20
are getting together?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.073
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:39.176
then the Americans
are pulling their weight.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.616
Uh-oh.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.400
(Laughter)

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.856
Xi Jinping seems fine.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.776
Angela Merkel has -- she always does --

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.176
that look, she always does that.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.216
But Putin is telling
Turkish president Erdogan what to do,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.840
and Obama is like,
what's going on over there?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.176
You see. And the problem is
it's not a G20,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.416
the problem is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.416
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.856
a world order where there is
no single country or alliance

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.256
that can meet the challenges
of global leadership.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160
The G20 doesn't work,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.320
the G7, all of our friends,
that's history.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.376
So globalization is continuing.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.056
Goods and services and people
and capital are moving across borders

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.096
faster and faster than ever before,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.160
but Americanization is not.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.456
So if I've convinced you of that,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.216
I want to do two things
with the rest of this talk.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.696
I want to talk
about the implications of that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.976
for the whole world.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.536
I'll go around it.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.176
And then I want to talk about

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.096
what we think right here

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.536
in the United States and in New York.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.176
So why? What are the implications.
Why are we here?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.016
Well, we're here

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.416
because the United States,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.256
we spent two trillion dollars
on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.496
that were failed.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.136
We don't want to do that anymore.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.816
We have large numbers
of middle and working classes

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.936
that feel like they've not benefited
from promises of globalization,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.000
so they don't want to see it particularly.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.296
And we have an energy revolution

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.496
where we don't need OPEC
or the Middle East the way we used to.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.976
We produce all that right here
in the United States.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.336
So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.656
or the architect of global trade.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.096
The Americans don't want to even be
the cheerleader of global values.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.776
Well, then you look to Europe,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.896
and the most important
alliance in the world

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.656
has been the transatlantic relationship.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.056
But it is now weaker than it has been
at any point since World War II,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.656
all of the crises,
the Brexit conversations,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.776
the hedging going on
between the French and the Russians,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
or the Germans and the Turks,
or the Brits and the Chinese.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.936
China does want to do more leadership.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.976
They do, but only in the economic sphere,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.096
and they want their own values,
standards, currency,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.216
in competition with that of the US.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.176
The Russians want to do more leadership.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.256
You see that in Ukraine,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.136
in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.896
but not with the Americans.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.536
They want their own preferences and order.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.456
That's why we are where we are.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.776
So what happens going forward?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.936
Let's start easy,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.160
with the Middle East.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.880
(Laughter)

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.176
You know, I left a little out,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.536
but you get the general idea.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.976
Look, there are three reasons

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.056
why the Middle East
has had stability such as it is. Right?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.176
One is because there was
a willingness to provide

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.576
some level of military security
by the US and allies.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.256
Number two, it was easy to take
a lot of cheap money out of the ground

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.056
because oil was expensive.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.416
And number three

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.536
was no matter how bad the leaders were,
the populations were relatively quiescent.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.336
They didn't have the ability,
and many didn't have the will

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.816
to really rise up against.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.376
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.016
all three of those things
are increasingly not true,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.376
and so failed states,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.616
terrorism, refugees and the rest.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.576
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.456
No, the Kurds will do better,
and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.856
But generally speaking,
it's not a good look.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.256
OK, how about this guy?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.736
He's playing a poor hand very well.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.656
There's no question
he's hitting above his weight.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.936
But long term -- I didn't mean that.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.256
But long term, long term,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.936
if you think that the Russians

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.576
were antagonized by the US and Europe
expanding NATO right up to their borders

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.246
when we said they weren't going to,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.656
and the EU encroaching them,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.136
just wait until the Chinese
put hundreds of billions of dollars

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.296
in every country around Russia
they thought they had influence in.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.976
The Chinese are going to dominate it.
The Russians are picking up the crumbs.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.360
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be
a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.696
It's not all bad. Right?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.976
Asia actually looks a lot better.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.176
There are real leaders across Asia,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.576
they have a lot of political stability.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.856
They're there for a while.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.136
Mr. Modi in India,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.136
Mr. Abe, who is probably
about to get a third term written in

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.136
in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.296
of course Xi Jinping
who is consolidating enormous power,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.656
the most powerful leader in China

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.336
since Mao.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.576
Those are the three
most important economies in Asia.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.416
Now look, there are problems in Asia.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.096
We see the sparring
over the South China Sea.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.816
We see that Kim Jong Un,
just in the last couple of days,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.016
tested yet another nuclear weapon.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.296
But the leaders in Asia
do not feel the need

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.856
to wave the flag,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.696
to go xenophobic,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.776
to actually allow escalation

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.296
of the geopolitical
and cross-border tensions.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.696
They want to focus on long-term
economic stability and growth.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720
And that's what they're actually doing.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.120
Let's turn to Europe.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.896
Europe does look a little scared
in this environment.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.216
So much of what is happening
in the Middle East

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.976
is washing up quite literally
onto European shores.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.775
You see Brexit and you see
the concerns of populism

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.376
across all of the European states.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.056
Let me tell you that over the long term,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.856
in a G-Zero world,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.600
European expansion
will be seen to have gone too far.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.296
Europe went right up to Russia,
went right down to the Middle East,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.576
and if the world were truly becoming
more flat and more Americanized,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.176
that would be less of a problem,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.696
but in a G-Zero world,
those countries nearest Russia

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.336
and nearest the Middle East

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.736
actually have different
economic capabilities,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.576
different social stability

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.776
and different political preferences
and systems than core Europe.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.816
So Europe was able to truly expand

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.896
under the G7,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.456
but under the G-Zero,
Europe will get smaller.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.496
Core Europe around Germany
and France and others

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.576
will still work, be functional,
stable, wealthy, integrated.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.016
But the periphery,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.496
countries like Greece
and Turkey and others,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.920
will not look that good at all.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.576
Latin America, a lot of populism,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.616
made the economies not go so well.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.496
They had been more opposed
to the United States for decades.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.456
Increasingly, they're coming back.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.136
We see that in Argentina.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.896
We see it with the openness in Cuba.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.136
We will see it in Venezuela
when Maduro falls.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.176
We will see it in Brazil
after the impeachment

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.080
and when we finally see
a new legitimate president elected there.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.816
The only place you see
that is moving in another direction

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.416
is the unpopularity
of Mexican president Peña Nieto.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.296
There you could actually see
a slip away from the United States

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.576
over the coming years.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.616
The US election matters a lot
on that one, too.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.960
(Laughter)

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.416
Africa, right?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.656
A lot of people have said
it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.216
In a G-Zero world,
it is absolutely an amazing time

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.976
for a few African countries,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.656
those governed well
with a lot of urbanization,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.176
a lot of smart people,
women really getting into the workforce,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.176
entrepreneurship taking off.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.976
But for most of the countries in Africa,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.896
it's going to be a lot more dicey:

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.936
extreme climate conditions,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.176
radicalism both from Islam
and also Christianity,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.616
very poor governance,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.656
borders you can't defend,
lots of forced migration.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.776
Those countries can fall off the map.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.536
So you're really going to see
an extreme segregation going on

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.896
between the winners
and the losers across Africa.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.816
Finally, back to the United States.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.456
What do I think about us?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.216
Because there are a lot of upset people,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.896
not here at TEDx, I know,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.696
but in the United States, my God,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.176
after 15 months of campaigning,
we should be upset.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.176
I understand that.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.456
But a lot of people are upset
because they say, "Washington's broken,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.976
we don't trust the establishment,
we hate the media."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.136
Heck, even globalists like me
are taking it on the chin.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.776
Look, I do think we have to recognize,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.016
my fellow campers,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.456
that when you are being
chased by the bear,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.776
in the global context,
you need not outrun the bear,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.416
you need to only outrun
your fellow campers.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.520
(Laughter)

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.856
Now, I just told you

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.976
about our fellow campers.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.936
Right? And from that perspective,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.976
we look OK.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.016
A lot of people in that context say,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.536
"Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.616
Let's send our kids
to American universities."

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.776
You know, our neighbors are awesome:

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.656
Canada, Mexico
and two big bodies of water.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.056
You know how much Turkey
would love to have neighbors like that?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.160
Those are awesome neighbors.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.696
Terrorism is a problem
in the United States.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.016
God knows we know it here in New York.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.517
But it's a much bigger problem
in Europe than the US.

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.856
It's a much bigger problem
in the Middle East

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.456
than it is in Europe.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.616
These are factors of large magnitude.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.616
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,
and we're complaining bitterly about it.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.456
You know why?
Because they can't swim here.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.176
Right? I mean, the Turks would love
to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.496
The Jordanians,
the Germans, the Brits. Right?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.776
That's not the situation.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.976
That's the reality of the United States.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.560
Now, that sounds pretty good.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.576
Here's the challenge.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.680
In a G-Zero world, the way you lead

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.216
is by example.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.256
If we know we don't want to be
the global cop anymore,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.233
if we know we're not going to be
the architect of global trade,

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:20.856
we're not going to be
the cheerleader of global values,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.976
we're not going to do it
the way we used to,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.381
the 21st century is changing,

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:27.256
we need to lead by example --
be so compelling

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.696
that all these other people
are going to still say,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.536
it's not just they're faster campers.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.656
Even when the bear is not chasing us,
this is a good place to be.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.040
We want to emulate them.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.320
The election process this year
is not proving a good option

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.720
for leading by example.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.096
Hillary Clinton says
it's going to be like the '90s.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.056
We can still be
that cheerleader on values.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.576
We can still be
the architect of global trade.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.296
We can still be the global sheriff.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.400
And Donald Trump wants
to bring us back to the '30s.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.496
He's saying, "Our way or the highway.
You don't like it, lump it." Right?

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.376
Neither are recognizing
a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.176
which is that even though
the US is not in decline,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.736
it is getting objectively harder

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.936
for the Americans to impose their will,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.656
even have great influence,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.680
on the global order.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.176
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.256
What would we have to do to fix this

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.496
after November,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.696
after the next president comes in?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.376
Well, either we have to have
another crisis that forces us to respond.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.056
A depression would do that.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.256
Another global financial
crisis could do this.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.296
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.776
Or, absent crisis,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.936
we need to see that the hollowing out,
the inequality, the challenges

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.336
that are growing and growing
in the United States,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.536
are themselves urgent enough

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.896
to force our leaders to change,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.376
and that we have those voices.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.296
Through our cell phones, individually,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.400
we have those voices
to compel them to change.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.200
There is, of course, a third choice,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.176
perhaps the most likely one,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.896
which is that we do
neither of those things,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.496
and in four years time you invite me back,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.720
and I will give this speech yet again.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.176
Thank you very, very much.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.085
(Applause)
