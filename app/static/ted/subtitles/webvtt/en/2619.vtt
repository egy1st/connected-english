00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.136
Half of the human workforce
is expected to be replaced

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.880
by software and robots
in the next 20 years.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.680
And many corporate leaders welcome
that as a chance to increase profits.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.816
Machines are more efficient;

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.800
humans are complicated
and difficult to manage.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.176
Well, I want our organizations
to remain human.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.000
In fact, I want them to become beautiful.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.735
Because as machines take our jobs
and do them more efficiently,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.976
soon the only work left for us humans
will be the kind of work

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080
that must be done beautifully
rather than efficiently.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.936
To maintain our humanity
in the this second Machine Age,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960
we may have no other choice
than to create beauty.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.456
Beauty is an elusive concept.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.880
For the writer Stendhal
it was the promise of happiness.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.856
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.296
(Laughter)

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.896
So bear with me

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.296
as I am proposing four admittedly
very subjective principles

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.240
that you can use to build
a beautiful organization.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.496
First: do the unnecessary.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.736
[Do the Unnecessary]

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.296
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.456
the CEO and founder
of the yogurt company Chobani,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.040
made headlines when he decided to grant
stock to all of his 2,000 employees.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.536
Some called it a PR stunt,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.776
others -- a genuine act of giving back.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.480
But there is something else
that was remarkable about it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.056
It came completely out of the blue.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.696
There had been no market
or stakeholder pressure,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.696
and employees were so surprised

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.200
that they burst into tears
when they heard the news.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.920
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful
because they catch us off guard.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.976
They create something out of nothing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240
because they're completely unnecessary.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.096
I once worked at a company

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.696
that was the result of a merger

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.376
of a large IT outsourcing firm
and a small design firm.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.376
We were merging 9,000 software engineers

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.160
with 1,000 creative types.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.536
And to unify these
immensely different cultures,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.616
we were going to launch
a third, new brand.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.136
And the new brand color
was going to be orange.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.576
And as we were going
through the budget for the rollouts,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.656
we decided last minute

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.336
to cut the purchase
of 10,000 orange balloons,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160
which we had meant
to distribute to all staff worldwide.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.960
They just seemed
unnecessary and cute in the end.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.816
I didn't know back then

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.376
that our decision
marked the beginning of the end --

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040
that these two organizations
would never become one.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.616
And sure enough,
the merger eventually failed.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.456
Now, was it because
there weren't any orange balloons?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.080
No, of course not.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.920
But the kill-the-orange-balloons
mentality permeated everything else.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.896
You might not always realize it,
but when you cut the unnecessary,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.400
you cut everything.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.800
Leading with beauty means
rising above what is merely necessary.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.920
So do not kill your orange balloons.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.696
The second principle:

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.056
create intimacy.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.456
[Create Intimacy]

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.296
Studies show that
how we feel about our workplace

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.040
very much depends on the relationships
with our coworkers.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.096
And what are relationships
other than a string of microinteractions?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.336
There are hundreds of these
every day in our organizations

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.640
that have the potential to distinguish
a good life from a beautiful one.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.456
The marriage researcher John Gottman says

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.096
that the secret of a healthy relationship

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.176
is not the great gesture
or the lofty promise,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.400
it's small moments of attachment.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.880
In other words, intimacy.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.656
In our networked organizations,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.296
we tout the strength of weak ties

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.176
but we underestimate
the strength of strong ones.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.096
We forget the words of the writer
Richard Bach who once said,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.336
"Intimacy --

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.576
not connectedness --

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.920
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.280
So how do we design
for organizational intimacy?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.336
The humanitarian organization CARE

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.736
wanted to launch
a campaign on gender equality

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.240
in villages in northern India.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.376
But it realized quickly

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.360
that it had to have this conversation
first with its own staff.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.016
So it invited all 36 team members
and their partners

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.776
to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.560
known for their famous erotic sculptures.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.096
And there they openly discussed
their personal relationships --

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.680
their own experiences of gender equality

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.016
with the coworkers and the partners.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.336
It was eye-opening for the participants.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.376
Not only did it allow them
to relate to the communities they serve,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.936
it also broke down invisible barriers

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.176
and created a lasting bond
amongst themselves.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.960
Not a single team member
quit in the next four years.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.160
So this is how you create intimacy.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.080
No masks ...

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.536
or lots of masks.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.776
(Laughter)

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.256
When Danone, the food company,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.840
wanted to translate its new company
manifesto into product initiatives,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.696
it gathered the management team

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.336
and 100 employees
from across different departments,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.976
seniority levels and regions

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.120
for a three-day strategy retreat.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.256
And it asked everybody
to wear costumes for the entire meeting:

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.376
wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.800
huge glasses and so on.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.816
And they left with concrete outcomes

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.520
and full of enthusiasm.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.016
And when I asked the woman
who had designed this experience

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.256
why it worked,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.096
she simply said, "Never underestimate
the power of a ridiculous wig."

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.296
(Laughter)

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.680
(Applause)

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.056
Because wigs erase hierarchy,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.936
and hierarchy kills intimacy --

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.176
both ways,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.880
for the CEO and the intern.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.576
Wigs allow us to use
the disguise of the false

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.040
to show something true about ourselves.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.336
And that's not easy
in our everyday work lives,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.696
because the relationship
with our organizations

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.600
is often like that of a married couple
that has grown apart,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.256
suffered betrayals and disappointments,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.600
and is now desperate to be beautiful
for one another once again.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.360
And for either of us the first step
towards beauty involves a huge risk.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.736
The risk to be ugly.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.096
[Be Ugly]

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.376
So many organizations these days
are keen on designing beautiful workplaces

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.016
that look like anything but work:

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.056
vacation resorts, coffee shops,
playgrounds or college campuses --

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.296
(Laughter)

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.496
Based on the promises
of positive psychology,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.896
we speak of play and gamification,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.456
and one start-up even says
that when someone gets fired,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.776
they have graduated.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.776
(Laughter)

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.296
That kind of beautiful language
only goes "skin deep,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.560
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.456
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.000
To be authentic is to be ugly.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.216
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun
or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.640
but it does mean that you speak
the actual ugly truth.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.016
Like this manufacturer

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.776
that wanted to transform
one of its struggling business units.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.216
It identified, named and pinned
on large boards all the issues --

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.896
and there were hundreds of them --

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.216
that had become obstacles
to better performance.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.816
They put them on boards,
moved them all into one room,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.096
which they called "the ugly room."

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.496
The ugly became visible
for everyone to see --

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.336
it was celebrated.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.216
And the ugly room served as a mix
of mirror exhibition and operating room --

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.760
a biopsy on the living flesh
to cut out all the bureaucracy.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.840
The ugliest part of our body is our brain.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.176
Literally and neurologically.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.440
Our brain renders ugly
what is unfamiliar ...

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.416
modern art, atonal music,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.656
jazz, maybe --

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.376
VR goggles for that matter --

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.480
strange objects, sounds and people.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.496
But we've all been ugly once.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.200
We were a weird-looking baby,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.160
a new kid on the block, a foreigner.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.440
And we will be ugly again
when we don't belong.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.216
The Center for Political Beauty,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.856
an activist collective in Berlin,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.560
recently staged an extreme
artistic intervention.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.096
With the permission of relatives,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.256
it exhumed the corpses of refugees
who had drowned at Europe's borders,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.176
transported them all the way to Berlin,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.000
and then reburied them
at the heart of the German capital.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.096
The idea was to allow them
to reach their desired destination,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.760
if only after their death.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.976
Such acts of beautification
may not be pretty,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.256
but they are much needed.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.736
Because things tend to get ugly
when there's only one meaning, one truth,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.200
only answers and no questions.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.880
Beautiful organizations
keep asking questions.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.600
They remain incomplete,

00:08:53.275 --> 00:08:55.656
which is the fourth
and the last of the principles.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.216
[Remain Incomplete]

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.560
Recently I was in Paris,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.376
and a friend of mine
took me to Nuit Debout,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.936
which stands for "up all night,"

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.896
the self-organized protest movement

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.840
that had formed in response
to the proposed labor laws in France.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.896
Every night, hundreds gathered
at the Place de la République.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.496
Every night they set up
a small, temporary village

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.120
to deliberate their own vision
of the French Republic.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.776
And at the core of this adhocracy

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.056
was a general assembly
where anybody could speak

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.680
using a specially designed sign language.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.176
Like Occupy Wall Street
and other protest movements,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.096
Nuit Debout was born
in the face of crisis.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.576
It was messy --

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.920
full of controversies and contradictions.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.696
But whether you agreed
with the movement's goals or not,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.440
every gathering was
a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.656
And how fitting that Paris --

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.456
the city of ideals, the city of beauty --

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.696
was it's stage.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.536
It reminds us that like great cities,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.736
the most beautiful organizations
are ideas worth fighting for --

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.800
even and especially
when their outcome is uncertain.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.776
They are movements;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.136
they are always imperfect,
never fully organized,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.856
so they avoid ever becoming banal.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.216
They have something
but we don't know what it is.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.176
They remain mysterious;
we can't take our eyes off them.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.160
We find them beautiful.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.096
So to do the unnecessary,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.776
to create intimacy,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.296
to be ugly,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.880
to remain incomplete --

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.536
these are not only the qualities
of beautiful organizations,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.000
these are inherently
human characteristics.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.240
And these are also the qualities
of what we call home.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.936
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.256
the least we can do is to ensure

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.296
that we still feel at home
in our organizations,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.720
and that we use our organizations
to create that feeling for others.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.696
Beauty can save the world
when we embrace these principles

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.200
and design for them.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.376
In the face of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.736
we need a new radical humanism.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.160
We must acquire and promote
a new aesthetic and sentimental education.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.680
Because if we don't,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.816
we might end up feeling like aliens

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.856
in organizations and societies
that are full of smart machines

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.696
that have no appreciation whatsoever

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.336
for the unnecessary,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.616
the intimate,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.336
the incomplete

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.040
and definitely not for the ugly.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.976
Thank you.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.862
(Applause)
