00:00:01.174 --> 00:00:02.333
Hi.

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:06.176
I want to talk about understanding,
and the nature of understanding,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.593
and what the essence of understanding is,

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.654
because understanding is something
we aim for, everyone.

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.089
We want to understand things.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:18.111
My claim is that understanding has to do

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.713
with the ability to change
your perspective.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.629
If you don't have that,
you don't have understanding.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:25.648
So that is my claim.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:27.571
And I want to focus on mathematics.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.546
Many of us think of mathematics
as addition, subtraction,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.518
multiplication, division,

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.352
fractions, percent, geometry,
algebra -- all that stuff.

00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:41.708
But actually, I want to talk
about the essence of mathematics as well.

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:45.019
And my claim is that mathematics
has to do with patterns.

00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:47.534
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:51.489
and this pattern actually emerges
just from drawing circles

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:53.143
in a very particular way.

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:58.367
So my day-to-day definition
of mathematics that I use every day

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.596
is the following:

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.858
First of all, it's about finding patterns.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.496
And by "pattern," I mean a connection,
a structure, some regularity,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.513
some rules that govern what we see.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.325
Second of all,

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.989
I think it is about representing
these patterns with a language.

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.805
We make up language if we don't have it,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.198
and in mathematics, this is essential.

00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:24.813
It's also about making assumptions

00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:28.450
and playing around with these assumptions
and just seeing what happens.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.556
We're going to do that very soon.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.841
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.775
Mathematics enables us
to do so many things.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.848
So let's have a look at these patterns.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.094
If you want to tie a tie knot,

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.428
there are patterns.

00:01:44.452 --> 00:01:45.923
Tie knots have names.

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:48.800
And you can also do
the mathematics of tie knots.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.402
This is a left-out, right-in,
center-out and tie.

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:55.616
This is a left-in, right-out,
left-in, center-out and tie.

00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:00.115
This is a language we made up
for the patterns of tie knots,

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:02.212
and a half-Windsor is all that.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.316
This is a mathematics book
about tying shoelaces

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.730
at the university level,

00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:09.732
because there are patterns in shoelaces.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.867
You can do it in so many different ways.

00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:13.135
We can analyze it.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.925
We can make up languages for it.

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.157
And representations
are all over mathematics.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.857
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:27.005
He invented a language
for patterns in nature.

00:02:27.363 --> 00:02:29.231
When we throw something up in the air,

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.445
it falls down.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.620
Why?

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:35.714
We're not sure, but we can represent
this with mathematics in a pattern.

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:37.888
This is also a pattern.

00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:40.612
This is also an invented language.

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.180
Can you guess for what?

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.857
It is actually a notation system
for dancing, for tap dancing.

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:52.788
That enables him as a choreographer
to do cool stuff, to do new things,

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.765
because he has represented it.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:00.034
I want you to think about how amazing
representing something actually is.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.363
Here it says the word "mathematics."

00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:06.305
But actually, they're just dots, right?

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.320
So how in the world can these dots
represent the word?

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:10.684
Well, they do.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:13.241
They represent the word "mathematics,"

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:15.825
and these symbols also represent that word

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.507
and this we can listen to.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.888
It sounds like this.

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:20.896
(Beeps)

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.210
Somehow these sounds represent
the word and the concept.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:25.890
How does this happen?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.402
There's something amazing
going on about representing stuff.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:35.583
So I want to talk about
that magic that happens

00:03:35.607 --> 00:03:37.578
when we actually represent something.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.618
Here you see just lines
with different widths.

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:43.267
They stand for numbers
for a particular book.

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.284
And I can actually recommend
this book, it's a very nice book.

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:47.330
(Laughter)

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.635
Just trust me.

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:51.798
OK, so let's just do an experiment,

00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:53.990
just to play around
with some straight lines.

00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:55.181
This is a straight line.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:56.359
Let's make another one.

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:59.192
So every time we move,
we move one down and one across,

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:01.790
and we draw a new straight line, right?

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:03.839
We do this over and over and over,

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.709
and we look for patterns.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.855
So this pattern emerges,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.262
and it's a rather nice pattern.

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:12.021
It looks like a curve, right?

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:14.617
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.555
Now I can change my perspective
a little bit. I can rotate it.

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:20.326
Have a look at the curve.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.729
What does it look like?

00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:23.735
Is it a part of a circle?

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.661
It's actually not a part of a circle.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:29.844
So I have to continue my investigation
and look for the true pattern.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.079
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.830
Well, no.

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:37.003
Perhaps I should extend
the lines like this,

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.797
and look for the pattern there.

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:40.116
Let's make more lines.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.370
We do this.

00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:45.162
And then let's zoom out
and change our perspective again.

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:49.312
Then we can actually see that
what started out as just straight lines

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:51.425
is actually a curve called a parabola.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.072
This is represented by a simple equation,

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.914
and it's a beautiful pattern.

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.296
So this is the stuff that we do.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.930
We find patterns, and we represent them.

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:04.578
And I think this is a nice
day-to-day definition.

00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:06.933
But today I want to go
a little bit deeper,

00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:10.901
and think about
what the nature of this is.

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:12.353
What makes it possible?

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:14.531
There's one thing
that's a little bit deeper,

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:18.058
and that has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.

00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:20.605
And I claim that when
you change your perspective,

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.435
and if you take another point of view,

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:27.369
you learn something new
about what you are watching

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.844
or looking at or hearing.

00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:33.262
And I think this is a really important
thing that we do all the time.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:37.814
So let's just look at
this simple equation,

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.387
x + x = 2 • x.

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:42.483
This is a very nice pattern,
and it's true,

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:45.336
because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.461
We've seen this over and over,
and we represent it like this.

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:50.669
But think about it: this is an equation.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:53.587
It says that something
is equal to something else,

00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:55.898
and that's two different perspectives.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.821
One perspective is, it's a sum.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.691
It's something you plus together.

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.087
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.554
and those are two different perspectives.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.888
And I would go as far as to say
that every equation is like this,

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.028
every mathematical equation
where you use that equality sign

00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:14.471
is actually a metaphor.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.925
It's an analogy between two things.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.444
You're just viewing something
and taking two different points of view,

00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:22.861
and you're expressing that in a language.

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:24.449
Have a look at this equation.

00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:26.728
This is one of the most
beautiful equations.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:29.120
It simply says that, well,

00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:31.795
two things, they're both -1.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.325
This thing on the left-hand side is -1,
and the other one is.

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:38.019
And that, I think, is one
of the essential parts

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:40.506
of mathematics -- you take
different points of view.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.865
So let's just play around.

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.156
Let's take a number.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.058
We know four-thirds.
We know what four-thirds is.

00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:49.084
It's 1.333, but we have to have
those three dots,

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:51.862
otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.782
But this is only in base 10.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:56.069
You know, the number system,
we use 10 digits.

00:06:56.093 --> 00:06:58.411
If we change that around
and only use two digits,

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:00.245
that's called the binary system.

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:01.972
It's written like this.

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:03.958
So we're now talking about the number.

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:05.528
The number is four-thirds.

00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:07.307
We can write it like this,

00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:10.336
and we can change the base,
change the number of digits,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.148
and we can write it differently.

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:16.339
So these are all representations
of the same number.

00:07:16.363 --> 00:07:19.911
We can even write it simply,
like 1.3 or 1.6.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:22.135
It all depends on
how many digits you have.

00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.903
Or perhaps we just simplify
and write it like this.

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:29.142
I like this one, because this says
four divided by three.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.203
And this number expresses
a relation between two numbers.

00:07:32.227 --> 00:07:35.191
You have four on the one hand
and three on the other.

00:07:35.215 --> 00:07:37.293
And you can visualize this in many ways.

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:41.364
What I'm doing now is viewing that number
from different perspectives.

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:42.539
I'm playing around.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.107
I'm playing around with
how we view something,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.843
and I'm doing it very deliberately.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.050
We can take a grid.

00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:52.752
If it's four across and three up,
this line equals five, always.

00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:55.464
It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.

00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:56.742
Four and three and five.

00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:59.888
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.503
you've seen a lot of times.

00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:03.340
This is your average computer screen.

00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:06.743
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.255
is a television or a computer screen.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.896
So these are all nice representations,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.842
but I want to go a little bit further
and just play more with this number.

00:08:15.866 --> 00:08:19.114
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.

00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:20.926
Observe the upper-left one.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.723
It goes a little bit faster, right?

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:24.295
You can see this.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.693
It actually goes exactly
four-thirds as fast.

00:08:27.717 --> 00:08:30.117
That means that when it goes
around four times,

00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:32.020
the other one goes around three times.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:35.545
Now let's make two lines, and draw
this dot where the lines meet.

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.271
We get this dot dancing around.

00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:38.332
(Laughter)

00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:40.125
And this dot comes from that number.

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:42.793
Right? Now we should trace it.

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.417
Let's trace it and see what happens.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:47.369
This is what mathematics is all about.

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.028
It's about seeing what happens.

00:08:49.052 --> 00:08:51.996
And this emerges from four-thirds.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.380
I like to say that this
is the image of four-thirds.

00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:56.700
It's much nicer -- (Cheers)

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:57.882
Thank you!

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:01.690
(Applause)

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.707
This is not new.

00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.765
This has been known
for a long time, but --

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:09.398
(Laughter)

00:09:09.422 --> 00:09:11.106
But this is four-thirds.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.689
Let's do another experiment.

00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:16.822
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:19.835
This is a perfect A, 440Hz.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.545
Let's multiply it by two.

00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:22.928
We get this sound. (Beep)

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:25.207
When we play them together,
it sounds like this.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.444
This is an octave, right?

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.233
We can do this game. We can play
a sound, play the same A.

00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:30.958
We can multiply it by three-halves.

00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:32.600
(Beep)

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:34.568
This is what we call a perfect fifth.

00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:35.638
(Beep)

00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:37.768
They sound really nice together.

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:41.915
Let's multiply this sound
by four-thirds. (Beep)

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:43.865
What happens?

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:45.320
You get this sound. (Beep)

00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:46.630
This is the perfect fourth.

00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:48.899
If the first one is an A, this is a D.

00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:50.953
They sound like this together. (Beeps)

00:09:50.977 --> 00:09:53.387
This is the sound of four-thirds.

00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:55.965
What I'm doing now,
I'm changing my perspective.

00:09:55.989 --> 00:09:58.769
I'm just viewing a number
from another perspective.

00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.758
I can even do this with rhythms, right?

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:04.454
I can take a rhythm and play
three beats at one time (Drumbeats)

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.029
in a period of time,

00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:10.395
and I can play another sound
four times in that same space.

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:11.461
(Clanking sounds)

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.866
Sounds kind of boring,
but listen to them together.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.676
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.990
(Laughter)

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:19.435
Hey! So.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.347
(Laughter)

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.530
I can even make a little hi-hat.

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:25.395
(Drumbeats and cymbals)

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:26.570
Can you hear this?

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:28.707
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.

00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:30.581
Again, this is as a rhythm.

00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:32.415
(Drumbeats and cowbell)

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.287
And I can keep doing this
and play games with this number.

00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:38.056
Four-thirds is a really great number.
I love four-thirds!

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.356
(Laughter)

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.867
Truly -- it's an undervalued number.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.750
So if you take a sphere and look
at the volume of the sphere,

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.707
it's actually four-thirds
of some particular cylinder.

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.265
So four-thirds is in the sphere.
It's the volume of the sphere.

00:10:51.824 --> 00:10:53.866
OK, so why am I doing all this?

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.120
Well, I want to talk about what it means
to understand something

00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:59.708
and what we mean
by understanding something.

00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:01.155
That's my aim here.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:03.309
And my claim is that
you understand something

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:06.325
if you have the ability to view it
from different perspectives.

00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:08.890
Let's look at this letter.
It's a beautiful R, right?

00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:10.092
How do you know that?

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:13.745
Well, as a matter of fact,
you've seen a bunch of R's,

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:15.414
and you've generalized

00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:18.408
and abstracted all of these
and found a pattern.

00:11:18.432 --> 00:11:21.794
So you know that this is an R.

00:11:23.643 --> 00:11:26.450
So what I'm aiming for here
is saying something

00:11:26.474 --> 00:11:29.855
about how understanding
and changing your perspective

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.211
are linked.

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:33.404
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:35.740
and I can actually use this
to teach something,

00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:40.604
because when I give someone else
another story, a metaphor, an analogy,

00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:43.027
if I tell a story
from a different point of view,

00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.564
I enable understanding.

00:11:44.588 --> 00:11:46.454
I make understanding possible,

00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:49.544
because you have to generalize
over everything you see and hear,

00:11:49.568 --> 00:11:54.167
and if I give you another perspective,
that will become easier for you.

00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.097
Let's do a simple example again.

00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:58.762
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:01.234
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.

00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:02.980
Let's just join them together.

00:12:03.004 --> 00:12:05.713
Now we're going to play a game;
we're going to fold it up

00:12:05.737 --> 00:12:07.419
into a three-dimensional structure.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:08.607
I love this.

00:12:08.631 --> 00:12:10.047
This is a square pyramid.

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:13.679
And let's just take two of them
and put them together.

00:12:13.703 --> 00:12:16.392
So this is what is called an octahedron.

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:19.123
It's one of the five platonic solids.

00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:21.592
Now we can quite literally
change our perspective,

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.311
because we can rotate it
around all of the axes

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:26.347
and view it from different perspectives.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.437
And I can change the axis,

00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:30.799
and then I can view it
from another point of view,

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:33.526
but it's the same thing,
but it looks a little different.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.218
I can do it even one more time.

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:38.544
Every time I do this,
something else appears,

00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:40.747
so I'm actually learning
more about the object

00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:42.296
when I change my perspective.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.714
I can use this as a tool
for creating understanding.

00:12:46.548 --> 00:12:50.140
I can take two of these
and put them together like this

00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.411
and see what happens.

00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:55.276
And it looks a little bit
like the octahedron.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.778
Have a look at it if I spin
it around like this.

00:12:57.802 --> 00:12:58.984
What happens?

00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:02.352
Well, if you take two of these,
join them together and spin it around,

00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:04.777
there's your octahedron again,

00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.432
a beautiful structure.

00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:08.620
If you lay it out flat on the floor,

00:13:08.644 --> 00:13:09.861
this is the octahedron.

00:13:09.885 --> 00:13:12.588
This is the graph structure
of an octahedron.

00:13:13.255 --> 00:13:15.628
And I can continue doing this.

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:19.179
You can draw three great circles
around the octahedron,

00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:21.053
and you rotate around,

00:13:21.077 --> 00:13:25.538
so actually three great circles
is related to the octahedron.

00:13:25.562 --> 00:13:29.221
And if I take a bicycle pump
and just pump it up,

00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:32.398
you can see that this is also
a little bit like the octahedron.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:35.097
Do you see what I'm doing here?

00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:37.802
I am changing the perspective every time.

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:41.451
So let's now take a step back --

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.512
and that's actually
a metaphor, stepping back --

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.899
and have a look at what we're doing.

00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:48.587
I'm playing around with metaphors.

00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.083
I'm playing around
with perspectives and analogies.

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:53.139
I'm telling one story in different ways.

00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:54.682
I'm telling stories.

00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:57.890
I'm making a narrative;
I'm making several narratives.

00:13:57.914 --> 00:14:01.436
And I think all of these things
make understanding possible.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.839
I think this actually is the essence
of understanding something.

00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:06.157
I truly believe this.

00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:08.608
So this thing about changing
your perspective --

00:14:08.608 --> 00:14:11.341
it's absolutely fundamental for humans.

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:13.450
Let's play around with the Earth.

00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:15.983
Let's zoom into the ocean,
have a look at the ocean.

00:14:16.007 --> 00:14:17.949
We can do this with anything.

00:14:17.973 --> 00:14:20.433
We can take the ocean
and view it up close.

00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:22.391
We can look at the waves.

00:14:22.415 --> 00:14:23.627
We can go to the beach.

00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:25.914
We can view the ocean
from another perspective.

00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:29.128
Every time we do this, we learn
a little bit more about the ocean.

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.741
If we go to the shore,
we can kind of smell it, right?

00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:33.475
We can hear the sound of the waves.

00:14:33.499 --> 00:14:35.545
We can feel salt on our tongues.

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:38.459
So all of these
are different perspectives.

00:14:38.483 --> 00:14:39.747
And this is the best one.

00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:41.414
We can go into the water.

00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:43.447
We can see the water from the inside.

00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.649
And you know what?

00:14:44.673 --> 00:14:47.754
This is absolutely essential
in mathematics and computer science.

00:14:47.778 --> 00:14:50.733
If you're able to view
a structure from the inside,

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.327
then you really learn something about it.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.372
That's somehow the essence of something.

00:14:55.883 --> 00:14:59.526
So when we do this,
and we've taken this journey

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.723
into the ocean,

00:15:00.747 --> 00:15:02.637
we use our imagination.

00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:05.314
And I think this is one level deeper,

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:09.072
and it's actually a requirement
for changing your perspective.

00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:10.985
We can do a little game.

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:13.050
You can imagine that you're sitting there.

00:15:13.074 --> 00:15:16.301
You can imagine that you're up here,
and that you're sitting here.

00:15:16.325 --> 00:15:18.651
You can view yourselves from the outside.

00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:20.613
That's really a strange thing.

00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:22.460
You're changing your perspective.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.343
You're using your imagination,

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:26.573
and you're viewing yourself
from the outside.

00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:29.102
That requires imagination.

00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:34.059
Mathematics and computer science
are the most imaginative art forms ever.

00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:37.066
And this thing about changing perspectives

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.598
should sound a little bit familiar to you,

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:41.834
because we do it every day.

00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:44.224
And then it's called empathy.

00:15:44.954 --> 00:15:47.653
When I view the world
from your perspective,

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:50.605
I have empathy with you.

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:52.477
If I really, truly understand

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.579
what the world looks
like from your perspective,

00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:57.074
I am empathetic.

00:15:57.098 --> 00:15:59.278
That requires imagination.

00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:02.286
And that is how we obtain understanding.

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:06.959
And this is all over mathematics
and this is all over computer science,

00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:12.518
and there's a really deep connection
between empathy and these sciences.

00:16:13.288 --> 00:16:16.092
So my conclusion is the following:

00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:20.153
understanding something really deeply

00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:22.838
has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.

00:16:23.894 --> 00:16:27.483
So my advice to you is:
try to change your perspective.

00:16:27.507 --> 00:16:29.056
You can study mathematics.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.513
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.

00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:36.471
Changing your perspective
makes your mind more flexible.

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.329
It makes you open to new things,

00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:41.178
and it makes you
able to understand things.

00:16:41.202 --> 00:16:43.219
And to use yet another metaphor:

00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:44.724
have a mind like water.

00:16:44.748 --> 00:16:45.899
That's nice.

00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:47.080
Thank you.

00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:51.275
(Applause)
