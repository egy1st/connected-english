WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.536
I feel incredibly lucky

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.416
to be from a country

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.296
that's generally considered
to be the best place in the world

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.760
to be a woman.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.456
In 1975, when I was seven years old,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.960
women in Iceland went on a strike.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.616
They did no work that day,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.416
whether they held professional jobs

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.560
or had the work of the home.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.776
They marched into
the center of Reykjavík --

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.375
90 percent of women participated --

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.176
and peacefully and in solidarity

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.040
asked for equality.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.080
Nothing worked in Iceland that day,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.736
because nothing works
when women are not at work.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.040
(Applause)

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.336
Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.496
to be the first country in the world

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.936
to democratically elect a woman
as their president.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.776
I will never forget this day,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.976
that President Vigdís,
as we know her by her first name,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.376
stepped out on the balcony
of her own home,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.616
a single mom with her daughter
by her side as she had won.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.120
(Applause)

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.696
This woman was an incredible role model

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.056
for me and everyone
growing up at that time,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.280
including boys.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.896
She frequently shares the story
of how a young boy approached her

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.936
after a couple of terms in office

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.856
and asked, "Can boys
really grow up to be president?"

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.016
(Laughter)

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.816
Role models really matter,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.656
but even with such strong role models

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.976
who I am so grateful for,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.856
when I was encouraged
to run for president,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.216
my first reaction was,
"Who am I to run for president?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600
Who am I to be president?"

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.015
It turns out that women

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.600
are less likely
to consider running than men.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.976
So a study done in the US in 2011

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.240
showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.096
but 45 percent of women.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.496
That's gap of 16 percentage points,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.000
and it's the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.296
And it really is a shame,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.336
because I am so convinced that the world
is in real need for women leaders

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.416
and more principle-based leadership

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.640
in general.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.600
So my decision to run

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.136
ultimately came down to the fact

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.360
that I felt

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.640
that I had to do my bit,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.040
even if I had no political experience,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.560
to step up and try to be part
of creating the world

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.376
that will make sense and be sustainable

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.936
for our kids,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.336
and a world where we truly allow
both our boys and girls

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240
to be all they can be.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.440
And it was the journey of my life.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.880
It was amazing.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.576
The journey started with potentially
as many as 20 candidates.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.016
It boiled down to
nine candidates qualifying,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280
and ultimately the race
came down to four of us,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.016
three men and me.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.720
(Applause)

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.456
But that's not all the drama yet.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.736
You may think you have drama in the US,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.976
but I can --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.440
(Laughter)

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.056
I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.016
So our sitting president of 20 years

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.696
announced initially
that he was not going to run,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.296
which is probably what gave rise

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.720
to so many candidates considering running.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.096
Then later he changed his mind

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.656
when our prime minister resigned

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.935
following the infamous Panama Papers

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.856
that implicated him and his family.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.936
And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.240
so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.016
A few days later, relations
to his wife and her family's companies

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.240
were also discovered in the Panama Papers,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.640
and so he withdrew from the race again.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.296
Before doing so, he said he was doing that

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.440
because now there were two qualified men

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.880
who he felt could fill his shoes
running for office.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.456
So on May 9, 45 days before election day,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.680
it was not looking too good for me.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.056
I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.056
The polls had me at 1 percent,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.536
but that was still the highest

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.600
that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.176
So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.496
to get my seat at the table

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.976
and access to television,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.416
because the network decided
that they would only include

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.856
those with 2.5 percent
or more in the polls

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.600
in the first TV debate.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.056
I found out on the afternoon
of the first TV debate

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.816
that I would participate
along with the three men,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.256
and I found out on live TV

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.616
that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent
on the day of the first TV debate.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.720
(Applause)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.200
So, challenges.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.976
The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.896
had to do with media, muscle and money.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.736
Let's start with media.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.136
There are those who say
gender doesn't matter

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.896
when it comes to media and politics.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.560
I can't say that I agree.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.040
It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.136
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.256
87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.400
whereas I appeared 31 times.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.856
And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.776
I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.600
because in media,
much like everywhere else,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.096
we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.576
and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.736
When I finally got access to TV,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.920
the first question I got was,
"Are you going to quit?"

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.336
And that was a hard one.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.216
But of course, with 1 percent
to 2.5 percent in the polls,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.520
maybe it's understandable.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.856
But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.096
we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.736
so I know firsthand how much this matters

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.056
and why we have to talk about it.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.496
I was the only one
out of the final four candidates

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.816
that never got a front page interview.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.936
I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.080
and out of coverage about the elections.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.976
So I did face this,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.456
but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.176
I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.776
(Applause)

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
So kudos to them.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.096
But there is another experience
that's very important.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.376
I ran as an independent candidate,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.696
not with any political party
or muscle behind me.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.056
That lack of experience

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.336
and lack of access to resources

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.376
probably came at a cost to our campaign,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.016
but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.280
We ran a positive campaign,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.880
and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.176
It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.280
because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.616
When access to media
proved to be so difficult,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.696
we ran our own media.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.576
I ran live Facebook sessions

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.720
where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.856
And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.936
because we thought
transparency is important

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.480
if you want to establish trust.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.256
And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.280
I became a Snapchatter.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.536
I got young people
to teach me how to do that,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.816
and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.056
And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.096
But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.296
So it's possible to run
a different type of campaign.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.400
But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.816
I am sad that it is that way,
but it's true,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.920
and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.896
This probably was partly due to the fact

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.016
that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.416
And maybe I also had the ambition
to do more with less.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.400
Some would call that very womanly of me.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.216
But even with one third the media,
one third the financial resources,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.776
and only an entrepreneurial team,
but an amazing team,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.976
we managed to surprise everyone
on election night,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.720
when the first numbers came in.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.296
I surprised myself,
as you may see in that photo.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.120
(Laughter)

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.280
So the first numbers,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.816
I came in neck to neck
to the leading candidate.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.240
(Cheers)

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.656
Well, too early,
because I didn't quite pull that,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.176
but I came in second,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.376
and we went a long way
from the one percent,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.376
with nearly a third of the vote,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.416
and we beat the polls
by an unprecedented margin,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.320
or 10 percentage points
above what the last poll came in at.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.656
Some people call me the real winner
of the election because of this,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.880
and there are many people
who encouraged me to run again.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.096
But what really makes me proud

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.776
is to know that I earned

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.496
proportionately higher percentage
support from the young people,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.656
and a lot of people encouraged
my daughter to run in 2040.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.600
(Applause)

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.880
She is 13,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.376
and she had never been on TV before.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.656
And on election day,
I observed her on TV repeatedly,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.016
and she was smart, she was self-confident,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.416
she was sincere, and she was
supportive of her mother.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.616
This was probably
the highlight of my campaign.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.200
(Applause)

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.416
But there was another one.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.976
These are preschool girls out on a walk,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.176
and they found
a poster of me on a bus stop,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.416
and they saw the need to kiss it.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.136
Audience: Aw!

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.640
This picture was really
enough of a win for me.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.560
What we see, we can be.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.336
So screw fear and challenges.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.736
(Applause)

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.016
It matters that women run,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.976
and it's time for women to run for office,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.920
be it the office of the CEO
or the office of the president.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.240
I also managed to put an impression
on your very own "New Yorker."

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.696
I earned a new title,
"A living emoji of sincerity."

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.880
(Cheers)

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.840
It is possibly my proudest title yet,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.576
and the reason is
that women too often get penalized

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.176
for using what I call
their emotional capital,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.096
but I know from experience
that we become so good

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.816
when we do just that.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.400
(Applause)

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.440
And we need more of that.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.696
We celebrated as if we had won
on election night,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.496
because that's how we felt.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.856
So you don't necessarily
have to reach that office.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.616
You just have to go for it,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.696
and you, your family, your friends,
everyone working with you,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.240
if you do it well, you will grow beyond
anything you will experience before.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.480
So we had a good time,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.096
and I learned a lot on this journey,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.856
probably more lessons
than I can share here

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.656
in the time we have today.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.176
But rest assured, it was hard work.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.920
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.376
It took resilience
and perseverance to not quit,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.656
but I learned something
that I knew before on the one percent day,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.696
and that is that you can only be good

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.616
when you are truly, authentically
listening to your own voice

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.320
and working in alignment with that.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.696
As a good sister of mine sometimes says,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.296
you may cheat on your intuition,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.760
but your intuition never cheats on you.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.816
I think it's also very important,
and you all know this,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.416
that on any journey you go on,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.080
it's the team you take along.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.376
It's having people around you
who share your values, your vision,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.440
but are different in every other way.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.416
That's the formula for success for me,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.896
and I am blessed with an amazing husband,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.120
here today,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.816
an incredible family --

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.776
(Applause)

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.016
and great friends,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.416
and we came together
as entrepreneurs in the political arena,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.256
and pulled something off
that everyone said would be impossible.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.456
As a matter of fact,
the leading PR expert told me

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.216
before I made my decision

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.880
that I would do well to get seven percent.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.856
I appreciated his perspective,
because he was probably right,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.056
and he was basing it
on valuable experience.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.416
But on the one percent day,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.560
I decided here to show him
that he was wrong.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.696
It's very important to mention this,
because I did lose a lot of sleep,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.040
and I worked hard,
and so did the people with me.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.536
We can never go the distance
if we forget to take care of ourselves.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.416
And it's two things that I think
are very important in that,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.976
in surrounding yourself with people
and practices that nourish you,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.776
but it's equally important,
maybe even more important,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.536
to have the courage
to get rid of people and practices

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.616
that take away your energy,

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.280
including the wonderful bloggers
and commentators.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.176
I took a lot of support
from others in doing this,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.256
and I made the decision to go high
when others went low,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.136
and that's partly how I kept
my energy going throughout all of this.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.336
And when I lost my energy for a moment --

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.656
and I did from time to time,
it wasn't easy --

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.976
I went back to why I decided to run,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.400
and how I had decided to run my own race.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.096
I called it a 4G campaign,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.896
the G's representing the Icelandic words.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.056
And the first one is called "Gagn."

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.336
I ran to do good,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.576
to be of service,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.096
and I wanted servant leadership

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.640
to be at the center of how I worked
and everybody else in the campaign.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.216
Second one is "Gleði," or joy.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.336
I decided to enjoy the journey.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.576
There was a lot to be taken
out of the journey,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.216
no matter if the destination
was reached or not.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.320
And I tried my utmost
to inspire others to do so as well.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.976
Third is "Gagnsæi."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.736
I was open to any questions.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.296
I kept no secrets,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.416
and it was all open,
on Facebook and websites.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.816
Because I think if you're
choosing your president,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.920
you deserve answers to your questions.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.136
Last but not least,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.536
I don't need to explain that in this room,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.456
we ran on the principle of Girlpower.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.960
(Cheers)

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.176
I am incredibly glad

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.416
that I had the courage to run,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.496
to risk failure but receive success

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.400
on so many levels.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.936
I can't tell you that it was easy,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.056
but I can tell you,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.736
and I think my entire team
will agree with me,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.800
that it was worth it.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.816
Thank you.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.536
(Applause)

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.760
Thank you.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.976
Thank you.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.480
(Applause)

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.930
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.690
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.935
PM: I can't let you go
without saying

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.935
that probably everybody in the room
is ready to move to Iceland

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.656
and vote for you.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.736
But of course we probably
can't vote there,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.136
but one thing we can get from Iceland

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.976
and have always gotten is inspiration.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.176
I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.216
when all the Icelandic women walked out,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.816
and that really was a very big factor
in launching the women's movement.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.296
You made a reference to it earlier.
I'd love to bring the picture back up

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.536
and just have us remember what it was like
when a country came to a standstill.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.896
And then what you may not know

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.936
because our American media
did not report it,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.856
the Icelandic women
walked out again on Monday. Right?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.547
HT: Yes, they did.
PM: Can you tell us about that?

00:18:05.571 --> 00:18:08.376
HT: Yes, so 41 years
after the original strike,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.656
we may be the best place
in the world to be a woman,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.016
but our work isn't done.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.656
So at 2:38pm on Monday,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.376
women in Iceland left work,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.296
because that's when
they had earned their day's salary.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.280
(Applause)

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.456
What's really cool about this

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.176
is that young women and men participated

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.376
in greater numbers than before,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.240
because it is time
that we close the pay gap.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.576
PM: So I'm not going to ask
Halla to commit right now

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.856
to what she's doing next,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.256
but I will say that you'd have
a very large volunteer army

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.696
should you decide to do that again.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.976
Thank you Halla.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.416
HT: Thank you all.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.835
(Applause)
