00:00:01.052 --> 00:00:02.715
Last year,

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:05.246
three of my family members
were gruesomely murdered

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.713
in a hate crime.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:10.428
It goes without saying
that it's really difficult

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:12.175
for me to be here today,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.782
but my brother Deah,

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:15.222
his wife Yusor,

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.777
and her sister Razan

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.510
don't give me much of a choice.

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.663
I'm hopeful that by the end
of this talk you will make a choice,

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:25.130
and join me in standing up against hate.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.746
It's December 27, 2014:

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.002
the morning of my brother's wedding day.

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:34.090
He asks me to come over and comb his hair

00:00:34.114 --> 00:00:36.254
in preparation
for his wedding photo shoot.

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.947
A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball,
particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.874
(Laughter)

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:48.830
An American kid in dental school
ready to take on the world.

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.482
When Deah and Yusor
have their first dance,

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.312
I see the love in his eyes,

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:55.966
her reciprocated joy,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.277
and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:01.945
I move to the back of the hall
and burst into tears.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:04.545
And the second the song finishes playing,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.756
he beelines towards me,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.031
buries me into his arms

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.475
and rocks me back and forth.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.123
Even in that moment,

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:12.024
when everything was so distracting,

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:13.901
he was attuned to me.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:15.756
He cups my face and says,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.960
"Suzanne,

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.268
I am who I am because of you.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.843
Thank you for everything.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.038
I love you."

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.663
About a month later, I'm back home
in North Carolina for a short visit,

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:33.398
and on the last evening,
I run upstairs to Deah's room,

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:36.717
eager to find out how he's feeling
being a newly married man.

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:39.042
With a big boyish smile he says,

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.780
"I'm so happy. I love her.
She's an amazing girl."

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.438
And she is.

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.840
At just 21, she'd recently
been accepted to join Deah

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:49.439
at UNC dental school.

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:53.249
She shared his love for basketball,
and at her urging,

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:57.196
they started their honeymoon off
attending their favorite team of the NBA,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.625
the LA Lakers.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.401
I mean, check out that form.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:03.652
(Laughter)

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.004
I'll never forget that moment
sitting there with him --

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:12.528
how free he was in his happiness.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:15.017
My littler brother,
a basketball-obsessed kid,

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.847
had become and transformed
into an accomplished young man.

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:21.599
He was at the top
of his dental school class,

00:02:21.623 --> 00:02:23.200
and alongside Yusor and Razan,

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:27.440
was involved in local and international
community service projects

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.793
dedicated to the homeless and refugees,

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:32.104
including a dental relief trip
they were planning

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.026
for Syrian refugees in Turkey.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:36.796
Razan, at just 19,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.974
used her creativity
as an architectural engineering student

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.689
to serve those around her,

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:43.960
making care packages
for the local homeless,

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.650
among other projects.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:47.631
That is who they were.

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:50.663
Standing there that night,

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:53.628
I take a deep breath
and look at Deah and tell him,

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.141
"I have never been more proud of you
than I am in this moment."

00:02:57.575 --> 00:02:59.380
He pulls me into his tall frame,

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:00.567
hugs me goodnight,

00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.821
and I leave the next morning
without waking him

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:04.285
to go back to San Francisco.

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.245
That is the last time I ever hug him.

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.615
Ten days later, I'm on call
at San Francisco General Hospital

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.485
when I receive a barrage of vague
text messages expressing condolences.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.317
Confused, I call my father,
who calmly intones,

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:23.342
"There's been a shooting
in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.358
It's on lock-down. That's all we know."

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.822
I hang up and quickly Google,
"shooting in Chapel Hill."

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:30.877
One hit comes up.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.323
Quote:

00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:34.608
"Three people were shot
in the back of the head

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:36.376
and confirmed dead on the scene."

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.466
Something in me just knows.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.610
I fling out of my chair and faint
onto the gritty hospital floor,

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:42.884
wailing.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.757
I take the first red-eye
out of San Francisco,

00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.018
numb and disoriented.

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.948
I walk into my childhood home
and faint into my parents' arms,

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:52.154
sobbing.

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:55.096
I then run up to Deah's room
as I did so many times before,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.168
just looking for him,

00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.785
only to find a void
that will never be filled.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.006
Investigation and autopsy reports
eventually revealed

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.549
the sequence of events.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.776
Deah had just gotten
off the bus from class,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.379
Razan was visiting for dinner,

00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:15.978
already at home with Yusor.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.384
As they began to eat,
they heard a knock on the door.

00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:21.436
When Deah opened it,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.211
their neighbor proceeded
to fire multiple shots at him.

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:28.317
According to 911 calls,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:30.378
the girls were heard screaming.

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:35.173
The man turned towards the kitchen
and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:36.347
immobilizing her.

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.139
He then approached her from behind,

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:40.408
pressed the barrel of his gun
against her head,

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:43.147
and with a single bullet,
lacerated her midbrain.

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:47.454
He then turned towards Razan,
who was screaming for her life,

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.640
and, execution-style, with a single bullet

00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:53.368
to the back of the head,

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:54.572
killed her.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:56.905
On his way out,

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.206
he shot Deah one last time --
a bullet in the mouth --

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.081
for a total of eight bullets:

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:03.959
two lodged in the head,

00:05:03.983 --> 00:05:05.494
two in his chest

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:07.548
and the rest in his extremities.

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:11.662
Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:15.044
in a place that was meant
to be safe: their home.

00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.315
For months, this man
had been harassing them:

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.744
knocking on their door,

00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:22.200
brandishing his gun
on a couple of occasions.

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:25.624
His Facebook was cluttered
with anti-religion posts.

00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:28.950
Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:31.471
As she was moving in,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.998
he told Yusor and her mom
that he didn't like the way they looked.

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:40.281
In response, Yusor's mom told her
to be kind to her neighbor,

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:41.662
that as he got to know them,

00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.429
he'd see them for who they were.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.796
I guess we've all become
so numb to the hatred

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.355
that we couldn't have ever imagined
it turning into fatal violence.

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:56.656
The man who murdered my brother
turned himself in to the police

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.492
shortly after the murders,

00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:00.746
saying he killed three kids,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.317
execution-style,

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:04.066
over a parking dispute.

00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:08.204
The police issued a premature
public statement that morning,

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:10.672
echoing his claims
without bothering to question it

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:12.147
or further investigate.

00:06:12.703 --> 00:06:15.750
It turns out there was no parking dispute.

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.380
There was no argument.

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:18.682
No violation.

00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:20.852
But the damage was already done.

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:23.382
In a 24-hour media cycle,

00:06:23.406 --> 00:06:26.843
the words "parking dispute" had already
become the go-to sound bite.

00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:32.173
I sit on my brother's bed
and remember his words,

00:06:32.763 --> 00:06:36.002
the words he gave me
so freely and with so much love,

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:38.257
"I am who I am because of you."

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.956
That's what it takes for me
to climb through my crippling grief

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.137
and speak out.

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.943
I cannot let my family's deaths
be diminished to a segment

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.065
that is barely discussed on local news.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.159
They were murdered by their neighbor
because of their faith,

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:55.641
because of a piece of cloth
they chose to don on their heads,

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.658
because they were visibly Muslim.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.419
Some of the rage I felt at the time

00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:05.364
was that if roles were reversed,

00:07:05.388 --> 00:07:09.203
and an Arab, Muslim
or Muslim-appearing person

00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:14.081
had killed three white American
college students execution-style,

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:15.261
in their home,

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:16.779
what would we have called it?

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:19.492
A terrorist attack.

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:23.475
When white men commit
acts of violence in the US,

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:24.719
they're lone wolves,

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:25.933
mentally ill

00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:27.781
or driven by a parking dispute.

00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:33.911
I know that I have to give
my family voice,

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:36.131
and I do the only thing I know how:

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.970
I send a Facebook message
to everyone I know in media.

00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:42.704
A couple of hours later,

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:46.522
in the midst of a chaotic house
overflowing with friends and family,

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:49.596
our neighbor Neal comes over,
sits down next to my parents

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.749
and asks, "What can I do?"

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:56.535
Neal had over two decades
of experience in journalism,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.964
but he makes it clear that he's not
there in his capacity as journalist,

00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:01.841
but as a neighbor who wants to help.

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:04.208
I ask him what he thinks we should do,

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:07.286
given the bombardment
of local media interview requests.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.122
He offers to set up a press conference
at a local community center.

00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.867
Even now I don't have
the words to thank him.

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:20.345
"Just tell me when, and I'll have
all the news channels present," he said.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.138
He did for us what we
could not do for ourselves

00:08:23.162 --> 00:08:24.814
in a moment of devastation.

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.332
I delivered the press statement,

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:29.483
still wearing scrubs
from the previous night.

00:08:29.507 --> 00:08:31.518
And in under 24 hours from the murders,

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:34.291
I'm on CNN being interviewed
by Anderson Cooper.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.902
The following day, major newspapers --

00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:39.677
including the New York Times,
Chicago Tribune --

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.332
published stories about Deah,
Yusor and Razan,

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.531
allowing us to reclaim the narrative

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:48.048
and call attention the mainstreaming
of anti-Muslim hatred.

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.491
These days,

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:57.095
it feels like Islamophobia
is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.

00:08:57.987 --> 00:09:00.299
We just have to put up with it and smile.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.503
The nasty stares,

00:09:02.527 --> 00:09:04.930
the palpable fear when boarding a plane,

00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:09.250
the random pat downs at airports
that happen 99 percent of the time.

00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:11.495
It doesn't stop there.

00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:16.264
We have politicians reaping political
and financial gains off our backs.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:17.448
Here in the US,

00:09:17.472 --> 00:09:19.839
we have presidential candidates
like Donald Trump,

00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.266
casually calling to register
American Muslims,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.725
and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees
from entering this country.

00:09:26.353 --> 00:09:29.077
It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.590
in parallel with election cycles.

00:09:34.748 --> 00:09:37.032
Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:38.856
a Lebanese-American Christian,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.636
was murdered in Oklahoma
by his neighbor --

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.910
a man who called him a "filthy Arab."

00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:47.338
This man was previously jailed
for a mere 8 months,

00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:50.485
after attempting run over
Khalid's mother with his car.

00:09:51.627 --> 00:09:54.481
Chances are you haven't heard
Khalid's story,

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:56.860
because it didn't make it
to national news.

00:09:57.232 --> 00:10:00.005
The least we can do is call it what it is:

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.345
a hate crime.

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:03.607
The least we can do is talk about it,

00:10:04.184 --> 00:10:07.563
because violence and hatred
doesn't just happen in a vacuum.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.454
Not long after coming back to work,

00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:15.456
I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.096
when one of my patients
looks over at my colleague,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.673
gestures around her face
and says, "San Bernardino,"

00:10:21.697 --> 00:10:23.674
referencing a recent terrorist attack.

00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:28.160
Here I am having just lost three
family members to Islamophobia,

00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.356
having been a vocal advocate
within my program

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.607
on how to deal with such microaggressions,

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.790
and yet --

00:10:33.814 --> 00:10:34.976
silence.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:36.801
I was disheartened.

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:38.539
Humiliated.

00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:41.348
Days later rounding on the same patient,

00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:42.688
she looks at me and says,

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:45.802
"Your people are killing
people in Los Angeles."

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:49.279
I look around expectantly.

00:10:49.303 --> 00:10:50.624
Again:

00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:51.848
silence.

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:54.595
I realize that yet again,

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:56.394
I have to speak up for myself.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.284
I sit on her bed and gently ask her,

00:11:00.308 --> 00:11:04.277
"Have I ever done anything
but treat you with respect and kindness?

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:08.581
Have I done anything but give
you compassionate care?"

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.578
She looks down and realizes
what she said was wrong,

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.337
and in front of the entire team,

00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:14.877
she apologizes and says,

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.487
"I should know better.
I'm Mexican-American.

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.943
I receive this kind
of treatment all the time."

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.618
Many of us experience
microaggressions on a daily basis.

00:11:27.156 --> 00:11:29.501
Odds are you may have experienced it,

00:11:29.525 --> 00:11:30.924
whether for your race,

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:32.099
gender,

00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:33.274
sexuality

00:11:33.298 --> 00:11:34.707
or religious beliefs.

00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:37.864
We've all been in situations
where we've witnessed something wrong

00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:39.148
and didn't speak up.

00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:42.829
Maybe we weren't equipped
with the tools to respond in the moment.

00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.289
Maybe we weren't even aware
of our own implicit biases.

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:50.585
We can all agree that bigotry
is unacceptable,

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.814
but when we see it,

00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:53.005
we're silent,

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:54.810
because it makes us uncomfortable.

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:57.988
But stepping right into that discomfort

00:11:58.012 --> 00:12:00.580
means you are also stepping
into the ally zone.

00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:04.648
There may be over three million
Muslims in America.

00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:07.747
That's still just one percent
of the total population.

00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:10.567
Martin Luther King once said,

00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:11.931
"In the end,

00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:14.461
we will remember not
the words of our enemies,

00:12:15.098 --> 00:12:17.239
but the silence of our friends."

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.688
So what made my neighbor
Neal's allyship so profound?

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:26.633
A couple of things.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.327
He was there as a neighbor who cared,

00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:32.543
but he was also bringing in
his professional expertise and resources

00:12:32.567 --> 00:12:34.110
when the moment called for it.

00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:36.548
Others have done the same.

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:39.574
Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform

00:12:39.598 --> 00:12:43.086
as the first tenured African-American
professor at Wheaton College

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.764
to wear a hijab in solidarity

00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:47.614
with Muslim women who face
discrimination every day.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.483
As a result, she lost her job.

00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:52.971
Within a month,

00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:55.518
she joined the faculty
at the University of Virginia,

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.183
where she now works on pluralism,
race, faith and culture.

00:13:00.562 --> 00:13:02.922
Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,

00:13:02.946 --> 00:13:06.674
demonstrated that not all active
allyship needs to be so serious.

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:09.933
He stepped up to support
a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:12.004
to introduce a hijab emoji.

00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:13.541
(Laughter)

00:13:14.035 --> 00:13:15.624
It's a simple gesture,

00:13:15.648 --> 00:13:18.185
but it has a significant
subconscious impact

00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:21.448
on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:24.117
including the community
as a part of an "us"

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:25.825
instead of an "other."

00:13:27.352 --> 00:13:29.669
The editor in chief
of Women's Running magazine

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:33.780
just put the first hijabi to ever be
on the cover of a US fitness magazine.

00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:36.763
These are all very different examples

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:39.742
of people who drew upon
their platforms and resources

00:13:39.766 --> 00:13:42.099
in academia, tech and media,

00:13:42.123 --> 00:13:44.312
to actively express their allyship.

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.690
What resources and expertise
do you bring to the table?

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:51.665
Are you willing to step
into your discomfort

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:54.201
and speak up when you witness
hateful bigotry?

00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:56.173
Will you be Neal?

00:13:57.258 --> 00:13:59.552
Many neighbors appeared in this story.

00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:03.344
And you, in your respective communities,
all have a Muslim neighbor,

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:04.521
colleague

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.876
or friend your child plays with at school.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.368
Reach out to them.

00:14:08.392 --> 00:14:10.968
Let them know you stand
with them in solidarity.

00:14:11.332 --> 00:14:12.724
It may feel really small,

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:15.543
but I promise you it makes a difference.

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:21.117
Nothing will ever bring back
Deah, Yusor and Razan.

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:24.070
But when we raise our collective voices,

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:25.809
that is when we stop the hate.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.512
Thank you.

00:14:27.536 --> 00:14:35.833
(Applause)
