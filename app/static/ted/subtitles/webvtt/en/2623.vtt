00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.896
I design engineering projects

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.256
for middle school
and high school students,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.080
often using materials
that are pretty unexpected.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.856
My inspiration comes
from problems in my daily life.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.096
For example,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.136
one time I needed a costume
to go to a comic convention,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.216
but I didn't want to spend too much money,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
so I made my own ...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.696
with a light-up crown and skirt.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.280
(Laughter)

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.856
Another time,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.816
I was devastated
because my favorite mobile game,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.056
Flappy Bird,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.736
was being taken off the app store.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.816
(Laughter)

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.376
So I was faced with the dilemma

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.296
to either never update my phone
or never play Flappy Bird again.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.200
(Laughter)

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.256
Unhappy with both options,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.816
I did the only thing
that made sense to me.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.016
I made a physical version of Flappy Bird

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.136
that could never be
taken off the app store.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.840
(Laughter)

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.600
(Music)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920
(Beeping)

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.616
(Music)

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.440
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.256
So a few of my friends
were also pretty addicted to the game,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.200
and I invited them to play as well.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.176
(Video) Friend: Ah!

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.760
(Laughter)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.616
(Video) Friend: What the heck?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.656
(Laughter)

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.656
And they told me that it was
just as infuriating as the original game.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.016
(Laughter)

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.416
So I uploaded a demo
of this project online,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.936
and to my surprise it went viral.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.056
It had over two million views
in just a few days.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.496
(Laughter)

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.736
And what's more interesting
are people's comments.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.176
A lot of people
wanted to make it their own,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.056
or asked me how it was made.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.376
So this kind of confirmed my idea
that through a creative project,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.560
we can teach people about engineering.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.576
With the money made from the viral video,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.856
we were able to let students
in our classroom

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.960
all make their own game in a box.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.416
Although it was pretty challenging,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.640
they learned a lot of new concepts
in engineering and programming.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.496
And they were all eager to learn
so they could finish the game as well.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.919
(Laughter)

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.056
So before Flappy Bird Box,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.616
I had the idea of using creative
engineering projects to teach students.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.896
When I was teaching at a middle school,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.736
we asked our students to build a robot
from a standard technology kit.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.656
And I noticed that
a lot of them seemed bored.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.456
Then a few of them
started taking pieces of paper

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.096
and decorating their robots.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.056
And then more of them got into it,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.696
and they became
more interested in the project.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.616
So I started looking
for more creative ways

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000
to introduce technology to students.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.696
What I found was that most technology kits
available in school

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.576
look a little intimidating.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.760
They're all made of plastic parts
that you can't customize.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.176
On top of that,
they're all very expensive,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.656
costing hundreds of dollars per kit.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.720
So that's certainly not very affordable
for most classroom budgets.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.776
Since I didn't find anything,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.016
I decided to make something on my own.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.976
I started with paper and fabric.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.176
After all, we all played
with those since we were kids,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.736
and they are also pretty cheap

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.520
and can be found
anywhere around the house.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.896
And I prototyped a project

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.496
where students
can create a light-up creature

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.016
using fabric and googly eyes.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.256
They were all helping
each other in classrooms,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.696
and were laughing
and discussing the project.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.936
And most importantly,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.920
they were able to insert
their own creativity into the project.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.736
So because of the success of this project,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.456
I continued to create
more engineering projects

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.336
to challenge my students.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.256
And I also started to take
these workshops outside of school

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.816
and into the community.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.176
And something really interesting happened.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.216
I noticed a lot of people
from very diverse backgrounds

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.616
started coming to our workshops.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.016
And specifically,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.896
there were a lot more women
and minorities than I expected,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.320
and that you wouldn't usually see
at a traditional engineering workshop.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.176
Now take a look at this employee report
at a major technology company in 2016.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.256
Women make up only 19 percent
of the technology workforce.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.680
And underrepresented minorities
make up only four percent.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.495
This statistic might look familiar

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.056
if you walked into
a high school robotics club,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040
or a college engineering class.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.016
Now, there's a wide variety of problems

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.416
that contribute to the lack of diversity
in the technology force.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.496
Perhaps one solution could be

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.000
to introduce technology to students
through creative projects.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.016
I'm not saying that this
could solve everything,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.216
but it could introduce technology

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.896
to people who originally
wouldn't be interested in it

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.840
because of how it has been
portrayed and taught in school.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.896
So how do we start to change
the perception of technology?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.536
Most students think
that it's boring or unwelcoming,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.336
so I have always designed projects
following three principles.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.856
First is having a low floor,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.960
and that means this project
is easy to get started.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.856
So take a look at this tutorial.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.976
The first project
we asked students to learn

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.096
is to make a circuit on paper.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.616
As you can see, it doesn't
take very long to learn,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.960
and it's pretty easy even for beginners.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.416
And having a low floor also means
that we're removing the financial barrier

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.456
that prevents people
from completing a project.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.336
So with paper, copper tape,
lightbulb and a battery,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.520
people can complete this project
for under a dollar.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.736
So second principle
is having a high ceiling.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.816
This means that there's
a lot of room to grow,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.120
and students are
constantly being challenged.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.976
At first it might just be
a light-up creature,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.816
but then you can add sensors
and microcontrollers,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.576
and start to program the creature
to interact with its environment.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.976
(Laughter)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.336
And finally,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.816
the third principle is customization.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.856
This means that we can make
this project relevant to anyone.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.376
That's the beauty
of using everyday materials;

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.600
it's very easy to customize
using paper and fabric.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.336
So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.000
you can still make your own game.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.896
(Video) Student: So our game
is about Justin Bieber,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.616
because he's been speeding,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.336
and the object is to prevent him
from getting caught by the LAPD --

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.640
(Laughter)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.176
(Video) Student:
Yeah, but he's changing so --

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.336
we're a part of his posse.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.456
(Laughter)

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.696
Thank you.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.343
(Applause)
