00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:02.453
Carlos,

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:04.030
the Vietnam vet Marine

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.838
who volunteered for three tours
and got shot up in every one.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.752
In 1971, he was medically retired

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.075
because he had so much
shrapnel in his body

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.217
that he was setting off metal detectors.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.380
For the next 42 years,
he suffered from nightmares,

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:21.618
extreme anxiety in public,

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.653
isolation, depression.

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:25.581
He self-medicated with alcohol.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.511
He was married and divorced three times.

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.256
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.706
Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.217
and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.763
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:48.573
Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn't there.

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.537
And so, we didn't know what to do.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.925
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.753
Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:58.875
and others still we simply said to them,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.213
"Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences."

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:06.877
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,
wilderness retreats --

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.822
many things which may
temporarily relieve stress,

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:13.751
but which don't actually eliminate
PTSD symptoms over the long term.

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.011
But things have changed.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:21.607
And I am here to tell you
that we can now eliminate PTSD,

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.458
not just manage the symptoms,

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.030
and in huge numbers of veterans.

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:28.032
Because new scientific research
has been able to show,

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:30.434
objectively, repeatedly,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.933
which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.

00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:35.605
Now as it turns out,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.859
the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:44.735
that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:47.706
Now, making war --

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.559
this is something that we are good at.

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:55.133
We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.470
And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:04.084
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.443
And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.788
we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:10.239
We are good at making war.

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.885
And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.

00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:18.176
Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.387
we begin to see that we
have not been as good

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.031
at preparing them to come home.

00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:24.649
Why is that?

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:29.005
Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.407
and they fought right where they lived.

00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:35.108
So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:38.024
there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:40.174
because we never really did.

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:42.619
But thankfully, today,

00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:45.658
most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:49.661
and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.182
now have the technology to put
our warriors through advanced training,

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.023
drop them in to fight
anywhere on the globe

00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:57.506
and when they're done,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.555
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:04.372
But just imagine for a moment
what this must feel like.

00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:07.084
I've spoken with veterans who've told me

00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:10.200
that one day they're in a brutal
firefight in Afghanistan

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.099
where they saw carnage and death,

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:16.337
and just three days later,
they found themselves

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.945
toting an ice chest
to their kid's soccer game.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:23.170
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.

00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:24.608
(Laughter)

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:27.751
It's the most common term
I've heard to describe that experience.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.299
And that's exactly what that is.

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:33.312
Because while our warriors
spend countless hours training for war,

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:35.229
we've only recently come to understand

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:38.713
that many require training
on how to return to civilian life.

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:43.733
Now, like any training, the best
PTSD treatments require repetition.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:44.908
In the military,

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:48.172
we don't simply hand trainees
Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:51.388
and say, "Here's the trigger,
here's some ammo and good luck."

00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:56.108
No. We train them, on the range
and in specific contexts,

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.818
over and over and over

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.631
until lifting their weapon
and engaging their target

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:02.491
is so engrained into muscle memory

00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:04.843
that it can be performed
without even thinking,

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:07.787
even under the most stressful
conditions you can imagine.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.364
Now, the same holds
for training-based treatments.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:15.206
The first of these treatments
is cognitive therapy,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.599
and this is a kind
of mental recalibration.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:20.795
When veterans come home from war,

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.415
their way of mentally framing
the world is calibrated

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.098
to an immensely
more dangerous environment.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.016
So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.245
you get problems.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.724
You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren't present.

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:41.071
You begin not trusting family or friends.

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:45.999
Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.094
It's just that the probability
of encountering them

00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.388
compared to combat

00:04:50.412 --> 00:04:52.720
is astronomically lower.

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:56.815
So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.223
We do train them, however,
to adjust caution

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.888
according to where they are.

00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:04.170
If you find yourself
in a bad neighborhood,

00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:05.449
you turn it up.

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:07.527
Out to dinner with family?

00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:09.479
You turn it way down.

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.747
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.825
to systematically gauge
the actual statistical probability

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.657
of encountering, say, an IED
here in peacetime America.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.724
With enough practice,
those recalibrations stick.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.507
The next of these treatments
is exposure therapy,

00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.958
and this is a kind of field training,

00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:35.514
and the fastest of the proven
effective treatments out there.

00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:37.531
You remember Carlos?

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.422
This was the treatment that he chose.

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.309
And so we started off
by giving him exercises,

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:43.639
for him, challenging ones:

00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:45.609
going to a grocery store,

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:48.258
going to a shopping mall,
going to a restaurant,

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:50.772
sitting with his back to the door.

00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:52.399
And, critically --

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:54.545
staying in these environments.

00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:57.501
Now, at first he was very anxious.

00:05:57.525 --> 00:06:00.017
He wanted to sit
where he could scan the room,

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:01.966
where he could plan escape routes,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.017
where he could get his hands
on a makeshift weapon.

00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:07.881
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.261
He remembered his training
in the Marine Corps,

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:13.129
and he pushed through his discomfort.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.722
And every time he did this,
his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,

00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:19.505
and then a little bit more
and then a little bit more,

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:20.843
until in the end,

00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:25.777
he had effectively relearned
how to sit in a public space

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:28.269
and just enjoy himself.

00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:33.022
He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:35.227
over and over and over.

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:39.946
He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.981
He processed his memories so much

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:46.234
that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:47.543
in his sleep.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.953
And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.348
he told me,

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:57.773
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:00.058
that I haven't had nightmares."

00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:05.590
Now, this is different
than erasing a memory.

00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:09.082
Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,

00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:10.763
but with enough practice,

00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:15.993
those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.940
They don't feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,

00:07:19.964 --> 00:07:23.770
and that is an immensely
better place to be.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.255
But it's often difficult.

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:31.315
And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.

00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:33.408
And there are trust issues.

00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:35.213
Sometimes I'm asked,

00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:37.891
"If you haven't been there, Doc,
how can you help me?"

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.378
Which is understandable.

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:44.615
But at the point of returning
to civilian life,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.624
you do not require
somebody who's been there.

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:51.101
You don't require training
for operations on the battlefield;

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:55.038
you require training on how to come home.

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.891
For the past 10 years of my work,

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:04.084
I have been exposed to detailed accounts

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:06.708
of the worst experiences
that you can imagine,

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:07.961
daily.

00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:10.083
And it hasn't always been easy.

00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:13.472
There have been times
where I have just felt my heart break

00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:15.343
or that I've absorbed too much.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.473
But these training-based
treatments work so well,

00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:22.579
that whatever this work takes out of me,
it puts back even more,

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:25.849
because I see people get better.

00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:28.577
I see people's lives transform.

00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:33.994
Carlos can now enjoy outings
with his grandchildren,

00:08:34.018 --> 00:08:37.225
which is something he couldn't even do
with his own children.

00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:41.624
And what's amazing to me
is that after 43 years of suffering,

00:08:41.648 --> 00:08:45.467
it only took him 10 weeks
of intense training to get his life back.

00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:48.309
And when I spoke with him, he told me,

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:52.350
"I know that I can't get those years back.

00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:57.997
But at least now, whatever days
that I have left on this Earth,

00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:59.938
I can live them in peace."

00:09:01.114 --> 00:09:04.586
He also said, "I hope that these
younger veterans don't wait

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.958
to get the help they need."

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.874
And that's my hope, too.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.206
Because ...

00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:12.446
this life is short,

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:16.555
and if you are fortunate enough
to have survived war

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.659
or any kind of traumatic experience,

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:22.198
you owe it to yourself
to live your life well.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.270
And you shouldn't wait
to get the training you need

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:26.679
to make that happen.

00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:33.978
Now, the best way of ending
human suffering caused by war

00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:36.383
is to never go to war.

00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:39.588
But we are just not there
yet as a species.

00:09:40.157 --> 00:09:41.417
Until we are,

00:09:41.441 --> 00:09:46.674
the mental suffering that we create
in our sons and in our daughters

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:48.246
when we send them off to fight

00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:50.932
can be alleviated.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:57.761
But we must ensure that the science,
the energy level, the value

00:09:57.785 --> 00:10:00.717
that we place on sending them off to war

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:03.426
is at the very least mirrored

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.056
in how well we prepare them
to come back home to us.
