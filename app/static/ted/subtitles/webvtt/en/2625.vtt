WEBVTT

00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:03.136
Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.325
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:06.339
CA: It feels like the world is in a place

00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.200
that we haven't seen for a long time.

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:12.785
People don't just disagree
in the way that we're familiar with,

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.709
on the left-right political divide.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.734
There are much deeper differences afoot.

00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.024
What on earth is going on,
and how did we get here?

00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:24.051
JH: This is different.

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.302
There's a much more
apocalyptic sort of feeling.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.652
Survey research by Pew Research shows

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:33.385
that the degree to which we feel
that the other side is not just --

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.383
we don't just dislike them;
we strongly dislike them,

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:39.883
and we think that they are
a threat to the nation.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.871
Those numbers have been going up and up,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.632
and those are over 50 percent
now on both sides.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:45.807
People are scared,

00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.458
because it feels like this is different
than before; it's much more intense.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.002
Whenever I look
at any sort of social puzzle,

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:55.143
I always apply the three basic
principles of moral psychology,

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.061
and I think they'll help us here.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.818
So the first thing that you
have to always keep in mind

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.578
when you're thinking about politics

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:02.982
is that we're tribal.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:04.529
We evolved for tribalism.

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:07.722
One of the simplest and greatest
insights into human social nature

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:08.919
is the Bedouin proverb:

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.335
"Me against my brother;

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.286
me and my brother against our cousin;

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.812
me and my brother and cousins
against the stranger."

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:19.560
And that tribalism allowed us
to create large societies

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:22.616
and to come together
in order to compete with others.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.321
That brought us out of the jungle
and out of small groups,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.368
but it means that we have
eternal conflict.

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:30.133
The question you have to look at is:

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.821
What aspects of our society
are making that more bitter,

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:34.375
and what are calming them down?

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.960
CA: That's a very dark proverb.

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:40.157
You're saying that that's actually
baked into most people's mental wiring

00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:41.332
at some level?

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:45.160
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
a basic aspect of human social cognition.

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:47.507
But we can also live together
really peacefully,

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.926
and we've invented all kinds
of fun ways of, like, playing war.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.332
I mean, sports, politics --

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:56.051
these are all ways that we get
to exercise this tribal nature

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.658
without actually hurting anyone.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:02.027
We're also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.350
So you have to see our tribalism
as something that goes up or down --

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:08.226
it's not like we're doomed
to always be fighting each other,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100
but we'll never have world peace.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.202
CA: The size of that tribe
can shrink or expand.

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:15.377
JH: Right.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.388
CA: The size of what we consider "us"

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:19.833
and what we consider "other" or "them"

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:21.987
can change.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.200
And some people believed that process
could continue indefinitely.

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:29.416
JH: That's right.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.646
CA: And we were indeed expanding
the sense of tribe for a while.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.831
JH: So this is, I think,

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:37.210
where we're getting at what's possibly
the new left-right distinction.

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:39.557
I mean, the left-right
as we've all inherited it,

00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.420
comes out of the labor
versus capital distinction,

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:44.819
and the working class, and Marx.

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:47.092
But I think what we're seeing
now, increasingly,

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.970
is a divide in all the Western democracies

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:53.701
between the people
who want to stop at nation,

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:55.475
the people who are more parochial --

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.296
and I don't mean that in a bad way --

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.120
people who have much more
of a sense of being rooted,

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:03.337
they care about their town,
their community and their nation.

00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:07.861
And then those who are
anti-parochial and who --

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:11.285
whenever I get confused, I just think
of the John Lennon song "Imagine."

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.138
"Imagine there's no countries,
nothing to kill or die for."

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:17.375
And so these are the people
who want more global governance,

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.073
they don't like nation states,
they don't like borders.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:21.922
You see this all over Europe as well.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:25.172
There's a great metaphor guy --
actually, his name is Shakespeare --

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:26.777
writing ten years ago in Britain.

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.968
He had a metaphor:

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:31.265
"Are we drawbridge-uppers
or drawbridge-downers?"

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.194
And Britain is divided
52-48 on that point.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:36.338
And America is divided on that point, too.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.956
CA: And so, those of us
who grew up with The Beatles

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.554
and that sort of hippie philosophy
of dreaming of a more connected world --

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:48.419
it felt so idealistic and "how could
anyone think badly about that?"

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:50.747
And what you're saying is that, actually,

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:55.073
millions of people today
feel that that isn't just silly;

00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:57.958
it's actually dangerous and wrong,
and they're scared of it.

00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:01.008
JH: I think the big issue, especially
in Europe but also here,

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.399
is the issue of immigration.

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:05.492
And I think this is where
we have to look very carefully

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:09.147
at the social science
about diversity and immigration.

00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:10.885
Once something becomes politicized,

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.933
once it becomes something
that the left loves and the right --

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:17.058
then even the social scientists
can't think straight about it.

00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:19.039
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:21.270
It clearly creates more innovation.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.771
The American economy
has grown enormously from it.

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:26.177
Diversity and immigration
do a lot of good things.

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.829
But what the globalists,
I think, don't see,

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:30.360
what they don't want to see,

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:36.662
is that ethnic diversity
cuts social capital and trust.

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.022
There's a very important
study by Robert Putnam,

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.902
the author of "Bowling Alone,"

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.781
looking at social capital databases.

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.752
And basically, the more people
feel that they are the same,

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:47.283
the more they trust each other,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:50.047
the more they can have
a redistributionist welfare state.

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:52.042
Scandinavian countries are so wonderful

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:55.415
because they have this legacy
of being small, homogenous countries.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.156
And that leads to
a progressive welfare state,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.983
a set of progressive
left-leaning values, which says,

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:05.008
"Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.

00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:08.064
People in Syria are suffering --
we must welcome them in."

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:09.465
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.517
But if, and I was in Sweden
this summer,

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.724
if the discourse in Sweden
is fairly politically correct

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.985
and they can't talk about the downsides,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.996
you end up bringing a lot of people in.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.712
That's going to cut social capital,

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.681
it makes it hard to have a welfare state

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.261
and they might end up,
as we have in America,

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.898
with a racially divided, visibly
racially divided, society.

00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:32.182
So this is all very
uncomfortable to talk about.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.451
But I think this is the thing,
especially in Europe and for us, too,

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:36.668
we need to be looking at.

00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:38.778
CA: You're saying that people of reason,

00:05:38.802 --> 00:05:41.290
people who would consider
themselves not racists,

00:05:41.314 --> 00:05:43.041
but moral, upstanding people,

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:46.011
have a rationale that says
humans are just too different;

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:51.474
that we're in danger of overloading
our sense of what humans are capable of,

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:53.988
by mixing in people who are too different.

00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:57.552
JH: Yes, but I can make it
much more palatable

00:05:57.576 --> 00:06:00.374
by saying it's not necessarily about race.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.086
It's about culture.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.283
There's wonderful work by a political
scientist named Karen Stenner,

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:09.534
who shows that when people have a sense

00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:11.793
that we are all united,
we're all the same,

00:06:11.817 --> 00:06:15.067
there are many people who have
a predisposition to authoritarianism.

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:17.133
Those people aren't particularly racist

00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:19.324
when they feel as through
there's not a threat

00:06:19.348 --> 00:06:21.047
to our social and moral order.

00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:23.104
But if you prime them experimentally

00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:26.260
by thinking we're coming apart,
people are getting more different,

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.807
then they get more racist, homophobic,
they want to kick out the deviants.

00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:32.738
So it's in part that you get
an authoritarian reaction.

00:06:32.762 --> 00:06:35.099
The left, following through
the Lennonist line --

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:36.409
the John Lennon line --

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:38.842
does things that create
an authoritarian reaction.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:41.661
We're certainly seeing that
in America with the alt-right.

00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:44.267
We saw it in Britain,
we've seen it all over Europe.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:46.873
But the more positive part of that

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:51.194
is that I think the localists,
or the nationalists, are actually right --

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:55.005
that, if you emphasize
our cultural similarity,

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:57.256
then race doesn't actually
matter very much.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.988
So an assimilationist
approach to immigration

00:07:00.012 --> 00:07:01.569
removes a lot of these problems.

00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:03.980
And if you value having
a generous welfare state,

00:07:04.004 --> 00:07:06.477
you've got to emphasize
that we're all the same.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.934
CA: OK, so rising immigration
and fears about that

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.125
are one of the causes
of the current divide.

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:14.862
What are other causes?

00:07:14.886 --> 00:07:16.907
JH: The next principle of moral psychology

00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:20.734
is that intuitions come first,
strategic reasoning second.

00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:23.238
You've probably heard
the term "motivated reasoning"

00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:24.869
or "confirmation bias."

00:07:24.893 --> 00:07:26.810
There's some really interesting work

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:29.911
on how our high intelligence
and our verbal abilities

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:33.137
might have evolved
not to help us find out the truth,

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.133
but to help us manipulate each other,
defend our reputation ...

00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:39.123
We're really, really good
at justifying ourselves.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.514
And when you bring
group interests into account,

00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:44.275
so it's not just me,
it's my team versus your team,

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:47.212
whereas if you're evaluating evidence
that your side is wrong,

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:48.993
we just can't accept that.

00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:51.734
So this is why you can't win
a political argument.

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:53.251
If you're debating something,

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:56.322
you can't persuade the person
with reasons and evidence,

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:58.691
because that's not
the way reasoning works.

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:01.830
So now, give us the internet,
give us Google:

00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:05.252
"I heard that Barack Obama
was born in Kenya.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:09.224
Let me Google that -- oh my God!
10 million hits! Look, he was!"

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:12.388
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant
surprise to a lot of people.

00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:15.260
Social media has often been framed
by techno-optimists

00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:20.531
as this great connecting force
that would bring people together.

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:24.477
And there have been some
unexpected counter-effects to that.

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:26.073
JH: That's right.

00:08:26.097 --> 00:08:28.478
That's why I'm very enamored
of yin-yang views

00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:30.120
of human nature and left-right --

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.610
that each side is right
about certain things,

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:34.755
but then it goes blind to other things.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:37.757
And so the left generally believes
that human nature is good:

00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:40.946
bring people together, knock down
the walls and all will be well.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.528
The right -- social conservatives,
not libertarians --

00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:47.805
social conservatives generally
believe people can be greedy

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:49.211
and sexual and selfish,

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:51.655
and we need regulation,
and we need restrictions.

00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:54.616
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.869
allow people to communicate
all over the world,

00:08:56.893 --> 00:08:58.951
you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:00.236
CA: So help us understand.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.812
These principles of human nature
have been with us forever.

00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:11.692
What's changed that's deepened
this feeling of division?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.016
JH: You have to see six to ten
different threads all coming together.

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:19.066
I'll just list a couple of them.

00:09:19.398 --> 00:09:23.876
So in America, one of the big --
actually, America and Europe --

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.813
one of the biggest ones is World War II.

00:09:25.837 --> 00:09:28.480
There's interesting research
from Joe Henrich and others

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:30.907
that says if your country was at war,

00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:32.488
especially when you were young,

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:35.626
then we test you 30 years later
in a commons dilemma

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.979
or a prisoner's dilemma,

00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:38.294
you're more cooperative.

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:41.856
Because of our tribal nature, if you're --

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.797
my parents were teenagers
during World War II,

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.382
and they would go out
looking for scraps of aluminum

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:48.595
to help the war effort.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:50.797
I mean, everybody pulled together.

00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.350
And so then these people go on,

00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:54.772
they rise up through business
and government,

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:56.427
they take leadership positions.

00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:59.702
They're really good
at compromise and cooperation.

00:09:59.726 --> 00:10:01.661
They all retire by the '90s.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.986
So we're left with baby boomers
by the end of the '90s.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.977
And their youth was spent fighting
each other within each country,

00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.648
in 1968 and afterwards.

00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:14.666
The loss of the World War II generation,
"The Greatest Generation,"

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.974
is huge.

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:17.742
So that's one.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.563
Another, in America,
is the purification of the two parties.

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:24.996
There used to be liberal Republicans
and conservative Democrats.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.187
So America had a mid-20th century
that was really bipartisan.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:32.578
But because of a variety of factors
that started things moving,

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:36.000
by the 90's, we had a purified
liberal party and conservative party.

00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:38.669
So now, the people in either party
really are different,

00:10:38.693 --> 00:10:41.176
and we really don't want
our children to marry them,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.268
which, in the '60s,
didn't matter very much.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:45.089
So, the purification of the parties.

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:47.585
Third is the internet and, as I said,

00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:52.292
it's just the most amazing stimulant
for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:57.108
CA: The tone of what's happening
on the internet now is quite troubling.

00:10:57.132 --> 00:10:59.979
I just did a quick search
on Twitter about the election

00:11:00.003 --> 00:11:02.923
and saw two tweets next to each other.

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:07.547
One, against a picture of racist graffiti:

00:11:08.007 --> 00:11:09.640
"This is disgusting!

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:12.834
Ugliness in this country,
brought to us by #Trump."

00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:14.806
And then the next one is:

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:18.642
"Crooked Hillary
dedication page. Disgusting!"

00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:23.383
So this idea of "disgust"
is troubling to me.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:26.642
Because you can have an argument
or a disagreement about something,

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.227
you can get angry at someone.

00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:32.687
Disgust, I've heard you say,
takes things to a much deeper level.

00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:34.598
JH: That's right. Disgust is different.

00:11:34.622 --> 00:11:36.585
Anger -- you know, I have kids.

00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:38.359
They fight 10 times a day,

00:11:38.383 --> 00:11:40.350
and they love each other 30 times a day.

00:11:40.374 --> 00:11:43.284
You just go back and forth:
you get angry, you're not angry;

00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:44.831
you're angry, you're not angry.

00:11:44.855 --> 00:11:46.165
But disgust is different.

00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:50.662
Disgust paints the person
as subhuman, monstrous,

00:11:50.686 --> 00:11:52.495
deformed, morally deformed.

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.943
Disgust is like indelible ink.

00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:59.283
There's research from John Gottman
on marital therapy.

00:11:59.307 --> 00:12:04.432
If you look at the faces -- if one
of the couple shows disgust or contempt,

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:07.552
that's a predictor that they're going
to get divorced soon,

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:10.475
whereas if they show anger,
that doesn't predict anything,

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:13.208
because if you deal with anger well,
it actually is good.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.684
So this election is different.

00:12:14.708 --> 00:12:18.362
Donald Trump personally
uses the word "disgust" a lot.

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:21.243
He's very germ-sensitive,
so disgust does matter a lot --

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:25.177
more for him, that's something
unique to him --

00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:28.104
but as we demonize each other more,

00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:31.537
and again, through
the Manichaean worldview,

00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:34.291
the idea that the world
is a battle between good and evil

00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:35.662
as this has been ramping up,

00:12:35.686 --> 00:12:39.012
we're more likely not just to say
they're wrong or I don't like them,

00:12:39.036 --> 00:12:41.572
but we say they're evil, they're satanic,

00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:43.517
they're disgusting, they're revolting.

00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.407
And then we want nothing to do with them.

00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:50.293
And that's why I think we're seeing it,
for example, on campus now.

00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:52.957
We're seeing more the urge
to keep people off campus,

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.926
silence them, keep them away.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.545
I'm afraid that this whole
generation of young people,

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:01.362
if their introduction to politics
involves a lot of disgust,

00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:05.091
they're not going to want to be involved
in politics as they get older.

00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:07.346
CA: So how do we deal with that?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.850
Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?

00:13:12.874 --> 00:13:14.822
JH: You can't do it with reasons.

00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:16.503
I think ...

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:21.474
I studied disgust for many years,
and I think about emotions a lot.

00:13:21.498 --> 00:13:25.023
And I think that the opposite
of disgust is actually love.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.855
Love is all about, like ...

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:31.810
Disgust is closing off, borders.

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:34.379
Love is about dissolving walls.

00:13:35.074 --> 00:13:37.554
So personal relationships, I think,

00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:40.337
are probably the most
powerful means we have.

00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:43.988
You can be disgusted by a group of people,

00:13:44.012 --> 00:13:45.930
but then you meet a particular person

00:13:45.954 --> 00:13:48.730
and you genuinely discover
that they're lovely.

00:13:48.754 --> 00:13:53.050
And then gradually that chips away
or changes your category as well.

00:13:54.016 --> 00:13:59.993
The tragedy is, Americans used to be
much more mixed up in the their towns

00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:02.151
by left-right or politics.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.506
And now that it's become
this great moral divide,

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.673
there's a lot of evidence
that we're moving to be near people

00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:09.209
who are like us politically.

00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:11.763
It's harder to find somebody
who's on the other side.

00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:14.077
So they're over there, they're far away.

00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:15.671
It's harder to get to know them.

00:14:15.695 --> 00:14:19.919
CA: What would you say to someone
or say to Americans,

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.101
people generally,

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:23.734
about what we should understand
about each other

00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:27.233
that might help us rethink for a minute

00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:29.460
this "disgust" instinct?

00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.238
JH: Yes.

00:14:31.262 --> 00:14:33.415
A really important
thing to keep in mind --

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:38.155
there's research by political
scientist Alan Abramowitz,

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:42.172
showing that American democracy
is increasingly governed

00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:44.439
by what's called "negative partisanship."

00:14:44.875 --> 00:14:47.986
That means you think,
OK there's a candidate,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.416
you like the candidate,
you vote for the candidate.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.499
But with the rise of negative advertising

00:14:52.523 --> 00:14:54.747
and social media
and all sorts of other trends,

00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:56.812
increasingly, the way elections are done

00:14:56.836 --> 00:15:00.817
is that each side tries to make
the other side so horrible, so awful,

00:15:00.841 --> 00:15:02.882
that you'll vote for my guy by default.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.289
And so as we more and more vote
against the other side

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:07.644
and not for our side,

00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:13.175
you have to keep in mind
that if people are on the left,

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.109
they think, "Well, I used to think
that Republicans were bad,

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:17.616
but now Donald Trump proves it.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.491
And now every Republican,
I can paint with all the things

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:21.897
that I think about Trump."

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.514
And that's not necessarily true.

00:15:23.538 --> 00:15:26.230
They're generally not very happy
with their candidate.

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:30.970
This is the most negative partisanship
election in American history.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.223
So you have to first separate
your feelings about the candidate

00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:38.184
from your feelings about the people
who are given a choice.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.691
And then you have to realize that,

00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:43.666
because we all live
in a separate moral world --

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.141
the metaphor I use in the book
is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,"

00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:50.689
or each moral community is a matrix,
a consensual hallucination.

00:15:50.713 --> 00:15:52.956
And so if you're within the blue matrix,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.174
everything's completely compelling
that the other side --

00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:59.829
they're troglodytes, they're racists,
they're the worst people in the world,

00:15:59.853 --> 00:16:01.957
and you have all the facts
to back that up.

00:16:01.981 --> 00:16:04.256
But somebody in the next house from yours

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.313
is living in a different moral matrix.

00:16:06.337 --> 00:16:08.284
They live in a different video game,

00:16:08.308 --> 00:16:10.686
and they see a completely
different set of facts.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.386
And each one sees
different threats to the country.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.500
And what I've found
from being in the middle

00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:18.451
and trying to understand both sides
is: both sides are right.

00:16:18.475 --> 00:16:20.595
There are a lot of threats
to this country,

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:24.104
and each side is constitutionally
incapable of seeing them all.

00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:31.482
CA: So, are you saying
that we almost need a new type of empathy?

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:33.676
Empathy is traditionally framed as:

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.391
"Oh, I feel your pain.
I can put myself in your shoes."

00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:39.344
And we apply it to the poor,
the needy, the suffering.

00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:43.846
We don't usually apply it
to people who we feel as other,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.335
or we're disgusted by.

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:46.510
JH: No. That's right.

00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:51.364
CA: What would it look like
to build that type of empathy?

00:16:52.268 --> 00:16:53.506
JH: Actually, I think ...

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.450
Empathy is a very, very
hot topic in psychology,

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.132
and it's a very popular word
on the left in particular.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:03.156
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.633
So it's important to empathize

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.481
with the groups that we on the left
think are so important.

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:10.036
That's easy to do,
because you get points for that.

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:14.091
But empathy really should get you points
if you do it when it's hard to do.

00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.267
And, I think ...

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:21.379
You know, we had a long 50-year period
of dealing with our race problems

00:17:21.403 --> 00:17:23.658
and legal discrimination,

00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:25.869
and that was our top priority
for a long time

00:17:25.893 --> 00:17:27.143
and it still is important.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:28.696
But I think this year,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.124
I'm hoping it will make people see

00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:33.943
that we have an existential
threat on our hands.

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:36.634
Our left-right divide, I believe,

00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:38.818
is by far the most important
divide we face.

00:17:38.842 --> 00:17:41.873
We still have issues about race
and gender and LGBT,

00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:45.268
but this is the urgent need
of the next 50 years,

00:17:45.292 --> 00:17:48.153
and things aren't going
to get better on their own.

00:17:49.021 --> 00:17:51.856
So we're going to need to do
a lot of institutional reforms,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.289
and we could talk about that,

00:17:53.313 --> 00:17:55.643
but that's like a whole long,
wonky conversation.

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:59.513
But I think it starts with people
realizing that this is a turning point.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.346
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.875
We need to realize:

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:05.441
this is what our country needs,

00:18:05.465 --> 00:18:07.819
and this is what you need
if you don't want to --

00:18:07.843 --> 00:18:10.538
Raise your hand if you want
to spend the next four years

00:18:10.562 --> 00:18:14.048
as angry and worried as you've been
for the last year -- raise your hand.

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:15.777
So if you want to escape from this,

00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:17.952
read Buddha, read Jesus,
read Marcus Aurelius.

00:18:17.976 --> 00:18:23.038
They have all kinds of great advice
for how to drop the fear,

00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:24.240
reframe things,

00:18:24.264 --> 00:18:26.347
stop seeing other people as your enemy.

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:29.678
There's a lot of guidance in ancient
wisdom for this kind of empathy.

00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:31.079
CA: Here's my last question:

00:18:31.103 --> 00:18:35.438
Personally, what can
people do to help heal?

00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:39.545
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide
to overcome your deepest prejudices.

00:18:39.569 --> 00:18:41.030
And there's research showing

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:45.403
that political prejudices are deeper
and stronger than race prejudices

00:18:45.427 --> 00:18:46.687
in the country now.

00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:50.827
So I think you have to make an effort --
that's the main thing.

00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:52.855
Make an effort to actually meet somebody.

00:18:52.879 --> 00:18:55.089
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:56.982
somebody who's on the other side.

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:58.822
So, after this election --

00:18:59.252 --> 00:19:00.603
wait a week or two,

00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:03.463
because it's probably going to feel
awful for one of you --

00:19:03.487 --> 00:19:07.639
but wait a couple weeks, and then
reach out and say you want to talk.

00:19:07.663 --> 00:19:09.087
And before you do it,

00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:12.256
read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win
Friends and Influence People" --

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.319
(Laughter)

00:19:13.343 --> 00:19:14.510
I'm totally serious.

00:19:14.534 --> 00:19:17.124
You'll learn techniques
if you start by acknowledging,

00:19:17.148 --> 00:19:18.309
if you start by saying,

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:20.003
"You know, we don't agree on a lot,

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.565
but one thing I really respect
about you, Uncle Bob,"

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:24.648
or "... about you conservatives, is ... "

00:19:24.672 --> 00:19:26.006
And you can find something.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.793
If you start with some
appreciation, it's like magic.

00:19:28.817 --> 00:19:30.931
This is one of the main
things I've learned

00:19:30.955 --> 00:19:32.868
that I take into my human relationships.

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:34.812
I still make lots of stupid mistakes,

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:36.852
but I'm incredibly good
at apologizing now,

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:39.293
and at acknowledging what
somebody was right about.

00:19:39.317 --> 00:19:40.471
And if you do that,

00:19:40.495 --> 00:19:43.989
then the conversation goes really well,
and it's actually really fun.

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:47.362
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating
speaking with you.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:51.144
It really does feel like
the ground that we're on

00:19:51.168 --> 00:19:56.035
is a ground populated by deep questions
of morality and human nature.

00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:58.790
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.

00:19:58.814 --> 00:20:01.109
Thank you so much for sharing
this time with us.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.285
JH: Thanks, Chris.

00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:03.470
JH: Thanks, everyone.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.494
(Applause)
