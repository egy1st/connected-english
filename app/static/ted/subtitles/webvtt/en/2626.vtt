00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.960
Economists have been exploring
people's behavior for hundreds of years:

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.456
how we make decisions,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.536
how we act individually and in groups,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.280
how we exchange value.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.216
They've studied the institutions
that facilitate our trade,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.656
like legal systems,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.920
corporations,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.720
marketplaces.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.056
But there is a new,
technological institution

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.096
that will fundamentally change
how we exchange value,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.600
and it's called the blockchain.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.696
Now, that's a pretty bold statement,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.856
but if you take nothing else
away from this talk,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.616
I actually want you to remember

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.576
that while blockchain technology
is relatively new,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.976
it's also a continuation
of a very human story,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.520
and the story is this.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.096
As humans, we find ways

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.936
to lower uncertainty about one another

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760
so that we can exchange value.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.575
Now, one of the first people
to really explore the idea

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.776
of institutions as a tool in economics

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.256
to lower our uncertainties
about one another

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.176
and be able to do trade

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.840
was the Nobel economist Douglass North.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.816
He passed away at the end of 2015,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.560
but North pioneered what's called
"new institutional economics."

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.296
And what he meant by institutions
were really just formal rules

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.296
like a constitution,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.240
and informal constraints, like bribery.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.176
These institutions are really the grease

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.136
that allow our economic
wheels to function,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.280
and we can see this play out
over the course of human history.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.576
If we think back to when we were
hunter-gatherer economies,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.536
we really just traded
within our village structure.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.976
We had some informal constraints in place,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.536
but we enforced
all of our trade with violence

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440
or social repercussions.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.296
As our societies grew more complex

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.536
and our trade routes grew more distant,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.576
we built up more formal institutions,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.936
institutions like banks for currency,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.656
governments, corporations.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.216
These institutions
helped us manage our trade

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.256
as the uncertainty
and the complexity grew,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880
and our personal control was much lower.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.840
Eventually with the internet,
we put these same institutions online.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.976
We built platform marketplaces
like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.536
just faster institutions
that act as middlemen

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.480
to facilitate human economic activity.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.976
As Douglass North saw it,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.656
institutions are a tool
to lower uncertainty

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.000
so that we can connect and exchange
all kinds of value in society.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.176
And I believe we are now entering

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.176
a further and radical evolution

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.656
of how we interact and trade,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.256
because for the first time,
we can lower uncertainty

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.856
not just with political
and economic institutions,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.616
like our banks, our corporations,
our governments,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.000
but we can do it with technology alone.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.936
So what is the blockchain?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.016
Blockchain technology
is a decentralized database

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.576
that stores a registry
of assets and transactions

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.400
across a peer-to-peer network.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.296
It's basically a public registry

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.160
of who owns what and who transacts what.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.896
The transactions are secured
through cryptography,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.696
and over time, that transaction history
gets locked in blocks of data

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.200
that are then cryptographically
linked together and secured.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.536
This creates an immutable,
unforgeable record

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.376
of all of the transactions
across this network.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.800
This record is replicated
on every computer that uses the network.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.480
It's not an app.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.320
It's not a company.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.880
I think it's closest in description
to something like Wikipedia.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.856
We can see everything on Wikipedia.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.920
It's a composite view that's constantly
changing and being updated.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.536
We can also track those changes
over time on Wikipedia,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.856
and we can create our own wikis,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.720
because at their core,
they're just a data infrastructure.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.096
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform
that stores words and images

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.600
and the changes to that data over time.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.976
On the blockchain,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.936
you can think of it
as an open infrastructure

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.640
that stores many kinds of assets.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.496
It stores the history of custodianship,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.736
ownership and location

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.416
for assets like
the digital currency Bitcoin,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.016
other digital assets

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.360
like a title of ownership of IP.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.616
It could be a certificate, a contract,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.896
real world objects,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.720
even personal identifiable information.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.936
There are of course other
technical details to the blockchain,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.976
but at its core, that's how it works.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.336
It's this public registry
that stores transactions in a network

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.560
and is replicated so that it's very secure
and hard to tamper with.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.256
Which brings me to my point

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.336
of how blockchains lower uncertainty

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.496
and how they therefore promise
to transform our economic systems

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.720
in radical ways.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.216
So uncertainty is kind of a big term

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.616
in economics,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.696
but I want to go through three forms of it

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.096
that we face in almost all
of our everyday transactions,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.216
where blockchains can play a role.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.616
We face uncertainties
like not knowing who we're dealing with,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.456
not having visibility into a transaction

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.400
and not having recourse
if things go wrong.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.880
So let's take the first example,
not knowing who we're dealing with.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.080
Say I want to buy
a used smartphone on eBay.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.080
The first thing I'm going to do
is look up who I'm buying from.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.336
Are they a power user?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.480
Do they have great reviews and ratings,
or do they have no profile at all?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.736
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.376
these are the attestations
about our identities

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.016
that we cobble together today

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.480
and use to lower uncertainty
about who we're dealing with.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.856
But the problem is
they're very fragmented.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.200
Think about how many profiles you have.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.016
Blockchains allow for us
to create an open, global platform

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.416
on which to store any attestation
about any individual

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.840
from any source.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.776
This allows us to create a user-controlled

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.160
portable identity.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.696
More than a profile,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.016
it means you can selectively reveal

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.976
the different attributes about you

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.296
that help facilitate trade or interaction,

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.176
for instance that a government
issued you an ID,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.456
or that you're over 21,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.096
by revealing the cryptographic proof

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.000
that these details exist
and are signed off on.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.016
Having this kind of portable identity

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.056
around the physical world
and the digital world

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.376
means we can do all kinds of human trade

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.800
in a totally new way.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.496
So I've talked about how blockchains
could lower uncertainty

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.056
in who we're dealing with.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.656
The second uncertainty that we often face

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.880
is just not having transparency
into our interactions.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.336
Say you're going to send me
that smartphone by mail.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.056
I want some degree of transparency.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.376
I want to know that the product I bought
is the same one that arrives in the mail

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.776
and that there's some record
for how it got to me.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.416
This is true not just
for electronics like smartphones,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.616
but for many kinds of goods and data,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.280
things like medicine, luxury goods,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.520
any kind of data or product
that we don't want tampered with.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.096
The problem in many companies,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.456
especially those that produce
something complicated like a smartphone,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.976
is they're managing
all of these different vendors

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.880
across a horizontal supply chain.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.816
All of these people
that go into making a product,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.496
they don't have the same database.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.536
They don't use the same infrastructure,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.680
and so it becomes really hard to see
transparently a product evolve over time.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.775
Using the blockchain, we can create

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.559
a shared reality
across nontrusting entities.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.856
By this I mean

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.256
all of these nodes in the network
do not need to know each other

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.696
or trust each other,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.856
because they each have the ability

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.960
to monitor and validate
the chain for themselves.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.776
Think back to Wikipedia.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.976
It's a shared database,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.816
and even though it has multiple readers

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.936
and multiple writers at the same time,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.680
it has one single truth.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.816
So we can create that using blockchains.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.816
We can create a decentralized database
that has the same efficiency of a monopoly

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.520
without actually creating
that central authority.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.616
So all of these vendors,
all sorts of companies,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.600
can interact using the same database
without trusting one another.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.736
It means for consumers,
we can have a lot more transparency.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.896
As a real-world object travels along,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.096
we can see its digital certificate
or token move on the blockchain,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.840
adding value as it goes.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.200
This is a whole new world
in terms of our visibility.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.320
So I've talked about how blockchains
can lower our uncertainties about identity

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.456
and how they change
what we mean about transparency

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.240
in long distances and complex trades,
like in a supply chain.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.616
The last uncertainty that we often face

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.280
is one of the most open-ended,
and it's reneging.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.416
What if you don't send me the smartphone?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.000
Can I get my money back?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.496
Blockchains allow us to write code,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.216
binding contracts,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.896
between individuals

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.576
and then guarantee
that those contracts will bear out

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.560
without a third party enforcer.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.616
So if we look at the smartphone example,
you could think about escrow.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.736
You are financing that phone,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.296
but you don't need to release the funds

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.136
until you can verify
that all the conditions have been met.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.360
You got the phone.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.656
I think this is one
of the most exciting ways

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.120
that blockchains lower our uncertainties,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.416
because it means to some degree

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.040
we can collapse institutions
and their enforcement.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.416
It means a lot of human economic activity

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.456
can get collateralized and automated,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.536
and push a lot of human
intervention to the edges,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.520
the places where information moves
from the real world to the blockchain.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.336
I think what would probably
floor Douglass North

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.736
about this use of technology

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.776
is the fact that the very thing
that makes it work,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.336
the very thing that keeps the blockchain
secure and verified,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.320
is our mutual distrust.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.696
So rather than all of our uncertainties

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.336
slowing us down

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.856
and requiring institutions

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.960
like banks, our governments,
our corporations,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.736
we can actually harness
all of that collective uncertainty

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.360
and use it to collaborate and exchange
more and faster and more open.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.856
Now, I don't want you
to get the impression

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.256
that the blockchain
is the solution to everything,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.200
even though the media has said
that it's going to end world poverty,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.576
it's also going to solve
the counterfeit drug problem

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.800
and potentially save the rainforest.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.296
The truth is, this technology
is in its infancy,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.536
and we're going to need to see
a lot of experiments take place

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.976
and probably fail

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.536
before we truly understand
all of the use cases

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.760
for our economy.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.416
But there are tons of people
working on this,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.136
from financial institutions

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.320
to technology companies,
start-ups and universities.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.056
And one of the reasons is
that it's not just an economic evolution.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.800
It's also an innovation
in computer science.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.816
Blockchains give us
the technological capability

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.416
of creating a record of human exchange,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.000
of exchange of currency,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.416
of all kinds of digital
and physical assets,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.016
even of our own personal attributes,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.360
in a totally new way.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.056
So in some ways,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.056
they become a technological institution

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.856
that has a lot of the benefits

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.080
of the traditional institutions
we're used to using in society,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.120
but it does this in a decentralized way.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.896
It does this by converting
a lot of our uncertainties

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.120
into certainties.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.896
So I think we need to start
preparing ourselves,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.456
because we are about to face a world

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.616
where distributed, autonomous institutions

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.640
have quite a significant role.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.816
Thank you.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.200
(Applause)

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.067
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.576
I think I understood that it's coming,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.496
it offers a lot of potential,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.696
and it's complex.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.800
What is your estimate
for the rate of adoption?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.736
Bettina Warburg: I think
that's a really good question.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.176
My lab is pretty much focused

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.656
on going the enterprise
and government route first,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.216
because in reality,
blockchain is a complex technology.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.016
How many of you actually understand
how the internet works?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.696
But you use it every day,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.496
so I think we're sort of facing
the same John Sculley idea

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.176
of technology should either be
invisible or beautiful,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.056
and blockchain is kind of
neither of those things right now,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.056
so it's better suited
for either really early adopters

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.296
who kind of get it and can tinker around

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.296
or for finding those best use cases

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.496
like identity or asset tracking
or smart contracts

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.536
that can be used at that level
of an enterprise or government.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.465
BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.

00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:41.696
BW: Thanks.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.120
(Applause)
