00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:06.858
Hi.

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:08.959
Thank you.

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.680
[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:13.849
The live audience was asked
to applaud ASL-style, in silence.]

00:00:13.873 --> 00:00:17.240
So, five years ago, this was me.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:19.752
I was a PhD student at Harvard,

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:21.809
and I loved to travel.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.652
I had just gotten engaged
to marry the love of my life.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:31.047
I was 28, and like so many of us
when we are in good health,

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.102
I felt like I was invincible.

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:38.147
Then one day I had
a fever of 104.7 degrees.

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:40.807
I probably should have gone to the doctor,

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.395
but I'd never really been sick in my life,

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.772
and I knew that usually,
if you have a virus,

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.929
you stay home and you make
some chicken soup,

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.266
and in a few days,
everything will be fine.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.336
But this time it wasn't fine.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.097
After the fever broke,

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.972
for three weeks I was so dizzy,
I couldn't leave my house.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.661
I would walk straight into door frames.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.295
I had to hug the walls
just to make it to the bathroom.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:11.270
That spring I got infection
after infection,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.652
and every time I went to the doctor,

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:16.459
he said there was absolutely
nothing wrong.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.158
He had his laboratory tests,

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:21.086
which always came back normal.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:23.842
All I had were my symptoms,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.796
which I could describe,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.512
but no one else can see.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.593
I know it sounds silly,

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:33.885
but you have to find a way
to explain things like this to yourself,

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.533
and so I thought maybe I was just aging.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:41.667
Maybe this is what it's like
to be on the other side of 25.

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.983
(Laughter)

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:46.976
Then the neurological symptoms started.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.301
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't
draw the right side of a circle.

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:55.631
Other times I wouldn't be able
to speak or move at all.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.064
I saw every kind of specialist:

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.160
infectious disease doctors,
dermatologists, endocrinologists,

00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:04.467
cardiologists.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.861
I even saw a psychiatrist.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.923
My psychiatrist said,
"It's clear you're really sick,

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:13.103
but not with anything psychiatric.

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.783
I hope they can find out
what's wrong with you."

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:22.160
The next day, my neurologist
diagnosed me with conversion disorder.

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.525
He told me that everything --

00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:28.232
the fevers, the sore throats,
the sinus infection,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.246
all of the gastrointestinal,
neurological and cardiac symptoms --

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.433
were being caused
by some distant emotional trauma

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:37.063
that I could not remember.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.067
The symptoms were real, he said,

00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:42.905
but they had no biological cause.

00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:47.136
I was training to be a social scientist.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.392
I had studied statistics,
probability theory,

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:52.990
mathematical modeling,
experimental design.

00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:59.051
I felt like I couldn't just reject
my neurologist's diagnosis.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.191
It didn't feel true,

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:04.685
but I knew from my training
that the truth is often counterintuitive,

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:07.953
so easily obscured
by what we want to believe.

00:03:08.514 --> 00:03:11.446
So I had to consider the possibility
that he was right.

00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:16.118
That day, I ran a small experiment.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.332
I walked back the two miles
from my neurologist's office to my house,

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.264
my legs wrapped in this strange,
almost electric kind of pain.

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:28.078
I meditated on that pain,

00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:32.121
contemplating how my mind
could have possibly generated all this.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.195
As soon as I walked through the door,

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.384
I collapsed.

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:39.619
My brain and my spinal cord were burning.

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.467
My neck was so stiff
I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.075
and the slightest sound --

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.934
the rustling of the sheets,

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.223
my husband walking barefoot
in the next room --

00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:53.871
could cause excruciating pain.

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:58.415
I would spend most
of the next two years in bed.

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:01.995
How could my doctor
have gotten it so wrong?

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.120
I thought I had a rare disease,

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.133
something doctors had never seen.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.121
And then I went online

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.523
and found thousands of people
all over the world

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.600
living with the same symptoms,

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.651
similarly isolated,

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:17.132
similarly disbelieved.

00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:19.137
Some could still work,

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:21.646
but had to spend their evenings
and weekends in bed,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.737
just so they could show up
the next Monday.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.444
On the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:28.206
some were so sick

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.536
they had to live in complete darkness,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.932
unable to tolerate
the sound of a human voice

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:35.865
or the touch of a loved one.

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.471
I was diagnosed
with myalgic encephalomyelitis.

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:46.006
You've probably heard it called
"chronic fatigue syndrome."

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:48.909
For decades, that's a name

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.538
that's meant that this

00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:52.961
has been the dominant image

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:56.260
of a disease that can be
as serious as this.

00:04:57.468 --> 00:04:58.992
The key symptom we all share

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.768
is that whenever we exert ourselves --
physically, mentally --

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:05.249
we pay and we pay hard.

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:09.301
If my husband goes for a run,
he might be sore for a couple of days.

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:12.724
If I try to walk half a block,
I might be bedridden for a week.

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:15.578
It is a perfect custom prison.

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.009
I know ballet dancers who can't dance,

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.206
accountants who can't add,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.788
medical students who never became doctors.

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:26.589
It doesn't matter what you once were;

00:05:27.056 --> 00:05:28.846
you can't do it anymore.

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.365
It's been four years,

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.985
and I've still never been as well as I was

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.485
the minute before I walked home
from my neurologist's office.

00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:41.878
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million
people around the world

00:05:41.902 --> 00:05:43.156
have this disease.

00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:46.867
In the US, where I'm from,
it's about one million people.

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:50.523
That makes it roughly twice as common
as multiple sclerosis.

00:05:51.797 --> 00:05:54.539
Patients can live for decades
with the physical function

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.697
of someone with congestive heart failure.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.348
Twenty-five percent of us
are homebound or bedridden,

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:04.628
and 75 to 85 percent of us
can't even work part-time.

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:07.389
Yet doctors do not treat us

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:10.002
and science does not study us.

00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:14.544
How could a disease this common
and this devastating

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:17.150
have been forgotten by medicine?

00:06:19.264 --> 00:06:21.788
When my doctor diagnosed me
with conversion disorder,

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:24.500
he was invoking a lineage
of ideas about women's bodies

00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:26.674
that are over 2,500 years old.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:28.948
The Roman physician Galen thought

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.943
that hysteria was caused
by sexual deprivation

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.492
in particularly passionate women.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.889
The Greeks thought the uterus
would literally dry up

00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:40.340
and wander around the body
in search of moisture,

00:06:40.364 --> 00:06:42.260
pressing on internal organs --

00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:43.498
yes --

00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:47.343
causing symptoms from extreme emotions

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:49.612
to dizziness and paralysis.

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:53.319
The cure was marriage and motherhood.

00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:59.458
These ideas went largely unchanged
for several millennia until the 1880s,

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:03.180
when neurologists tried to modernize
the theory of hysteria.

00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:05.417
Sigmund Freud developed a theory

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.237
that the unconscious mind
could produce physical symptoms

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.276
when dealing with memories or emotions

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.611
too painful for the conscious
mind to handle.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:15.514
It converted these emotions
into physical symptoms.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.656
This meant that men
could now get hysteria,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.178
but of course women were still
the most susceptible.

00:07:23.448 --> 00:07:27.065
When I began investigating
the history of my own disease,

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.134
I was amazed to find how deep
these ideas still run.

00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:32.197
In 1934,

00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:36.996
198 doctors, nurses and staff
at the Los Angeles County General Hospital

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.561
became seriously ill.

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:42.996
They had muscle weakness, stiffness
in the neck and back, fevers --

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.374
all of the same symptoms
I had when I first got diagnosed.

00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:49.247
Doctors thought
it was a new form of polio.

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:53.064
Since then, there have been more
than 70 outbreaks documented

00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:54.249
around the world,

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:56.711
of a strikingly similar
post-infectious disease.

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:00.912
All of these outbreaks have tended
to disproportionately affect women,

00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:05.409
and in time, when doctors failed to find
the one cause of the disease,

00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:08.572
they thought that these outbreaks
were mass hysteria.

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:12.020
Why has this idea had such staying power?

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:15.363
I do think it has to do with sexism,

00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:18.828
but I also think that fundamentally,
doctors want to help.

00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:20.622
They want to know the answer,

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:25.537
and this category allows doctors to treat
what would otherwise be untreatable,

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.366
to explain illnesses
that have no explanation.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.771
The problem is that this
can cause real harm.

00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:35.978
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist
named Eliot Slater

00:08:36.002 --> 00:08:40.186
studied a cohort of 85 patients
who had been diagnosed with hysteria.

00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:44.763
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead
and 30 had become disabled.

00:08:44.787 --> 00:08:48.220
Many had undiagnosed conditions
like multiple sclerosis,

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:50.140
epilepsy, brain tumors.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:54.984
In 1980, hysteria was officially
renamed "conversion disorder."

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:58.887
When my neurologist gave me
that diagnosis in 2012,

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:01.528
he was echoing Freud's words verbatim,

00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:02.703
and even today,

00:09:02.727 --> 00:09:07.101
women are 2 to 10 times more likely
to receive that diagnosis.

00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:12.486
The problem with the theory of hysteria
or psychogenic illness

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.544
is that it can never be proven.

00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:17.423
It is by definition
the absence of evidence,

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.567
and in the case of ME,

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.596
psychological explanations
have held back biological research.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.919
All around the world, ME is one
of the least funded diseases.

00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:34.263
In the US, we spend each year
roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:37.529
250 dollars per MS patient

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.307
and just 5 dollars per year
per ME patient.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:44.206
This was not just lightning.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.994
I was not just unlucky.

00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:49.585
The ignorance surrounding my disease
has been a choice,

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:53.733
a choice made by the institutions
that were supposed to protect us.

00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:58.406
We don't know why ME
sometimes runs in families,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.895
why you can get it
after almost any infection,

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:04.652
from enteroviruses
to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,

00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:08.363
or why it affects women
at two to three times the rate of men.

00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:11.777
This issue is much bigger
than just my disease.

00:10:12.356 --> 00:10:13.539
When I first got sick,

00:10:13.563 --> 00:10:15.721
old friends were reaching out to me.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.309
I soon found myself a part
of a cohort of women in their late 20s

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.019
whose bodies were falling apart.

00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:24.867
What was striking was just how
much trouble we were having

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:26.049
being taken seriously.

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.535
I learned of one woman with scleroderma,

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:30.659
an autoimmune connective tissue disease,

00:10:30.683 --> 00:10:33.393
who was told for years
that it was all in her head.

00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.929
Between the time of onset and diagnosis,

00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:38.380
her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.649
she will never be able to eat again.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.855
Another woman with ovarian cancer,

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.124
who for years was told
that it was just early menopause.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.756
A friend from college,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.675
whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed
for years as anxiety.

00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:55.832
Here's why this worries me:

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:00.576
since the 1950s, rates of many
autoimmune diseases

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.303
have doubled to tripled.

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:05.758
Forty-five percent of patients
who are eventually diagnosed

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:07.776
with a recognized autoimmune disease

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.308
are initially told they're hypochondriacs.

00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:13.933
Like the hysteria of old,
this has everything to do with gender

00:11:13.957 --> 00:11:15.823
and with whose stories we believe.

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:20.625
Seventy-five percent
of autoimmune disease patients are women,

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:23.828
and in some diseases,
it's as high as 90 percent.

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:27.933
Even though these diseases
disproportionately affect women,

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:29.609
they are not women's diseases.

00:11:29.633 --> 00:11:33.321
ME affects children
and ME affects millions of men.

00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:35.130
And as one patient told me,

00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:36.662
we get it coming and going --

00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:40.294
if you're a woman, you're told
you're exaggerating your symptoms,

00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:43.776
but if you're a guy, you're told
to be strong, to buck up.

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:48.825
And men may even have
a more difficult time getting diagnosed.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:00.284
My brain is not what it used to be.

00:12:13.914 --> 00:12:15.241
Here's the good part:

00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:18.824
despite everything, I still have hope.

00:12:19.903 --> 00:12:23.803
So many diseases were once
thought of as psychological

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:26.735
until science uncovered
their biological mechanisms.

00:12:27.323 --> 00:12:30.417
Patients with epilepsy
could be forcibly institutionalized

00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:35.045
until the EEG was able to measure
abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.776
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed
as hysterical paralysis

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.112
until the CAT scan and the MRI
discovered brain lesions.

00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:45.460
And recently, we used to think

00:12:45.484 --> 00:12:48.304
that stomach ulcers
were just caused by stress,

00:12:48.328 --> 00:12:51.648
until we discovered
that H. pylori was the culprit.

00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:55.695
ME has never benefited
from the kind of science

00:12:55.719 --> 00:12:58.029
that other diseases have had,

00:12:58.053 --> 00:12:59.717
but that's starting to change.

00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:04.202
In Germany, scientists are starting
to find evidence of autoimmunity,

00:13:04.226 --> 00:13:06.568
and in Japan, of brain inflammation.

00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:10.460
In the US, scientists at Stanford
are finding abnormalities

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.380
in energy metabolism

00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:15.866
that are 16 standard deviations
away from normal.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.685
And in Norway, researchers
are running a phase-3 clinical trial

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:24.376
on a cancer drug that in some patients
causes complete remission.

00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:27.459
What also gives me hope

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:30.333
is the resilience of patients.

00:13:31.968 --> 00:13:33.842
Online we came together,

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:35.930
and we shared our stories.

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:40.223
We devoured what research there was.

00:13:40.743 --> 00:13:42.820
We experimented on ourselves.

00:13:43.496 --> 00:13:45.869
We became our own scientists
and our own doctors

00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.484
because we had to be.

00:13:48.378 --> 00:13:52.117
And slowly I added five percent here,
five percent there,

00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:54.374
until eventually, on a good day,

00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:56.304
I was able to leave my home.

00:13:57.815 --> 00:14:00.402
I still had to make ridiculous choices:

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:04.409
Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,
or will I wash my hair today?

00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:07.352
But it gave me hope
that I could be treated.

00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:10.035
I had a sick body; that was all.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:14.820
And with the right kind of help,
maybe one day I could get better.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.943
I came together with patients
around the world,

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:21.220
and we started to fight.

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:25.034
We have filled the void
with something wonderful,

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.190
but it is not enough.

00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:32.699
I still don't know if I will ever
be able to run again,

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:34.620
or walk at any distance,

00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:38.553
or do any of those kinetic things
that I now only get to do in my dreams.

00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:42.233
But I am so grateful
for how far I have come.

00:14:43.955 --> 00:14:45.440
Progress is slow,

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.756
and it is up

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.566
and it is down,

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.135
but I am getting a little better each day.

00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:57.932
I remember what it was like
when I was stuck in that bedroom,

00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:01.496
when it had been months
since I had seen the sun.

00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:05.314
I thought that I would die there.

00:15:06.961 --> 00:15:08.528
But here I am today,

00:15:09.255 --> 00:15:10.537
with you,

00:15:11.513 --> 00:15:13.574
and that is a miracle.

00:15:16.606 --> 00:15:20.225
I don't know what would have happened
had I not been one of the lucky ones,

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:22.554
had I gotten sick before the internet,

00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:24.969
had I not found my community.

00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:28.505
I probably would have already
taken my own life,

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.935
as so many others have done.

00:15:32.094 --> 00:15:35.318
How many lives could
we have saved, decades ago,

00:15:35.957 --> 00:15:37.860
if we had asked the right questions?

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:40.775
How many lives could we save today

00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:43.754
if we decide to make a real start?

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:48.248
Even once the true cause
of my disease is discovered,

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.356
if we don't change
our institutions and our culture,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.756
we will do this again to another disease.

00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:57.652
Living with this illness has taught me

00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.604
that science and medicine
are profoundly human endeavors.

00:16:01.153 --> 00:16:03.744
Doctors, scientists and policy makers

00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:06.655
are not immune to the same biases

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.147
that affect all of us.

00:16:11.377 --> 00:16:14.429
We need to think in more nuanced ways
about women's health.

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:19.221
Our immune systems are just as much
a battleground for equality

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.827
as the rest of our bodies.

00:16:21.253 --> 00:16:23.597
We need to listen to patients' stories,

00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:27.107
and we need to be willing
to say, "I don't know."

00:16:28.024 --> 00:16:30.376
"I don't know" is a beautiful thing.

00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:33.827
"I don't know" is where discovery starts.

00:16:35.365 --> 00:16:36.787
And if we can do that,

00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:41.142
if we can approach the great vastness
of all that we do not know,

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:43.118
and then, rather than fear uncertainty,

00:16:43.142 --> 00:16:45.653
maybe we can greet it
with a sense of wonder.

00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:47.693
Thank you.

00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:53.336
Thank you.
