WEBVTT

00:00:00.863 --> 00:00:03.852
I am so excited to be here.

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:06.680
Everything in America
is so much bigger than in Europe.

00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:08.676
Look at me -- I am huge!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.361
(Laughter)

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.535
It's fantastic!

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.839
And TED Talks -- TED Talks
are where everybody has great ideas.

00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:18.260
So the question is: Where do
those great ideas come from?

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.630
Well, it's a little bit of debate,

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.192
but it's generally reckoned
that the average person --

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:24.374
that's me --

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:26.932
has about 50,000 thoughts a day.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:28.114
Which is a lot,

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.964
until you realize that 95 percent of them

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.615
are the same ones you had the day before.

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.842
(Laughter)

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.255
And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.484
I think things like,

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.593
"Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor.

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:45.349
Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:46.655
My most popular:

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.585
"Don't eat that cookie."

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.167
(Laughter)

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.928
So, 95 percent repetition.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:58.884
That leaves us with just a five percent
window of opportunity each day

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.857
to actually think something new.

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.673
And some of my new thoughts are useless.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.326
The other day I was watching
some sports on television,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.076
and I was trying to decide
why I just don't engage with it.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.363
Some of it I find curious.

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.642
This is odd.

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:15.816
(Laughter)

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:18.765
Do you think it would be
worth being that flexible

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.041
just to be able to see
your heel at that angle?

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.935
(Laughter)

00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:26.969
And here's the thing:

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:29.139
I'm never going to be able
to relate to that,

00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.443
because I'm never going
to be able to do it, OK?

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.285
Well, not twice, anyway.

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:34.937
(Laughter)

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.467
But I'll tell you the truth.

00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:41.294
The truth is I have never been
any good at sport, OK?

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:43.995
I've reached that wonderful age
when all my friends say,

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:47.221
"Oh, I wish I was as fit
as I was when I was 18."

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:49.386
And I always feel rather smug then.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.647
(Laughter)

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.270
I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --

00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:57.619
(Laughter)

00:01:57.643 --> 00:01:59.135
(Applause)

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.029
I couldn't run then. I'm certainly
not going to do it now.

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:04.076
(Laughter)

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.657
So then I had my new idea:

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:08.759
Why not engage people like me in sport?

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.551
I think what the world needs now

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:14.497
is the Olympics for people
with zero athletic ability.

00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:16.433
(Laughter)

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.404
Oh, it would be so much more fun.

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:20.038
We'd have three basic rules, OK?

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:23.139
Obviously no drugs;
no corruption, no skills.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.203
(Laughter)

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.380
It would be --

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:27.862
No, it's a terrible idea.

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:32.038
And I also know why I don't engage
with sport when I watch it on television.

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:36.649
It's because probably 97 percent of it
is about men running

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.199
and men kicking things,

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:41.117
men trying to look
neatly packaged in Lycra.

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.300
There is --

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:43.822
(Laughter)

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:45.584
Not always successfully.

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:46.760
There is --

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:47.816
(Laughter)

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.073
There is so little
female sport on television,

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.978
that a young woman watching
might be forgiven for thinking,

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.559
and how can I put this nicely,

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:59.180
that the male member
is the very lever you need

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.809
to get yourself off the couch
and onto a sports ground.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.762
(Laughter)

00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:09.806
The inequalities in sport
are breathtaking.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.267
So this is what happens to me:

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.451
I have a brand new idea,

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:15.193
and immediately I come back to an old one.

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:17.305
The fact is, there is not now,

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.752
nor has there ever been
in the whole of history,

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:26.642
a single country in the world
where women have equality with men.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.836
Not one.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.547
196 countries,

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:31.877
it hasn't happened
in the whole of evolution.

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.871
So, here is a picture of evolution.

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.410
(Laughter)

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.825
We women are not even in it!

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.585
(Laughter)

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:50.658
It's a wonder men have been able
to evolve quite so brilliantly.

00:03:50.682 --> 00:03:51.840
So --

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:52.873
(Laughter)

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:56.623
It bugs me, and I know
I should do something about it.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.235
But I'm busy, OK?

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.431
I have a full-on career,

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.595
I've got three kids,
I've got an elderly mom.

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.186
In fact, if I'm honest with you,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.853
one of the reasons I came out here

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.727
is because TED Talks said
I could have 15 minutes to myself,

00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.492
and I never have that much time --

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.885
(Laughter)

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.436
(Applause)

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.616
So I'm busy.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.177
And anyway, I already had a go
at changing the world.

00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:22.359
Here's the thing, OK?

00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:25.539
Everybody has inside themselves
what I call an "activation button."

00:04:25.563 --> 00:04:27.949
It's the button that gets
pressed when you think,

00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:29.777
"I must do something about this."

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.023
It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.

00:04:32.047 --> 00:04:33.953
Maybe you face some kind of inequality,

00:04:33.977 --> 00:04:36.253
or you've come across
an injustice of some kind,

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:37.818
sometimes an illness strikes,

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:40.236
or you're born in some way disadvantaged,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.077
or perhaps underprivileged.

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:44.006
So I was born gay, OK?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.290
I've always known,

00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:48.352
I don't think my family
were the least bit surprised.

00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:51.594
Here is a picture of me aged four.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.401
I look cute,

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.576
but inside I genuinely believed
that I looked like Clint Eastwood.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.929
(Laughter)

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:06.865
So my activation button
was pressed when I had my kids --

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.895
three wonderful kids,
born to my then-partner.

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.450
Now here's the thing:
I work on television in Britain.

00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:16.415
By the time they were born,
I was already hosting my own shows

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.871
and working in the public eye.

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:19.046
I love what I do,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.233
but I love my kids more.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:24.951
And I didn't want them
to grow up with a secret.

00:05:24.975 --> 00:05:28.460
1994, when my son, my youngest was born,

00:05:28.484 --> 00:05:30.556
there was not, as far as I was aware,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.138
a single out, gay woman
in British public life.

00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:37.526
I don't think secrets are a good thing.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.493
I think they are a cancer of the soul.

00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:41.669
So I decided to come out.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.482
Everybody warned me
that I would never work again,

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:48.062
but I decided it was
absolutely worth the risk.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:49.944
Well, it was hell.

00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:55.164
In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
section of the right-wing press,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.751
and they went nuts.

00:05:56.775 --> 00:06:01.206
And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.860
and we got death threats --

00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:05.794
enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,

00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:08.428
and we had to have police protection.

00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:13.120
And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night

00:06:13.144 --> 00:06:16.398
when I was terrified by what I had done.

00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:18.457
Eventually the dust settled.

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.808
Against all expectation
I carried on working,

00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:24.500
and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.

00:06:24.524 --> 00:06:27.437
I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.

00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.054
They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:32.911
The friend said to my son,
"What's it like having two mums?"

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.229
I was a little anxious to hear,
so I leant in to hear and my son said,

00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:38.475
"It's fantastic,
because if one of them's sick,

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.663
you've still got another one
to cook for you."

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:43.264
(Laughter)

00:06:45.422 --> 00:06:49.218
So my activation button
for gay equality was pressed,

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.446
and along with many, many others,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.891
I campaigned for years for gay rights,

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:57.082
and in particular, the right to marry
the person that I love.

00:06:57.106 --> 00:06:59.186
In the end, we succeeded.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.826
And in 2014, on the day
that the law was changed,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.996
I married my wife,
who I love very much, indeed.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.742
(Applause)

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:12.924
We didn't do it in a quiet way --
we did it on the stage

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:14.805
at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

00:07:15.212 --> 00:07:16.367
It was a great event.

00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:18.543
The hall seats two-and-a-half
thousand people.

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.140
We invited 150 family and friends,
then I let it be known to the public:

00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:25.377
anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,
please come and join us.

00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.626
It would be free to anybody
who wanted to come.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.772
Two-and-half thousand people turned up.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:33.017
(Applause)

00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:35.996
Every kind of person you can imagine:

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.620
gays, straights, rabbis,
nuns, married people,

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:41.199
black, white -- the whole
of humanity was there.

00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:44.897
And I remember standing
on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.556
Job done.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.943
Love triumphs.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.379
Law changed."

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:50.561
And I --

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:53.304
(Applause)

00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:56.648
And I genuinely thought
my activation days were over, OK?

00:07:56.672 --> 00:07:59.085
So every year in that same hall,

00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:03.781
I host a fantastic concert to celebrate
International Women's Day.

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:06.979
We gather the world's only
all-female orchestra,

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:10.792
we play fantastic music by forgotten
or overlooked women composers,

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:12.228
we have amazing conductors --

00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:14.546
it's Marin Alsop there
from Baltimore conducting,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.732
Petula Clark singing --

00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:18.436
and I give a lecture on women's history.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.845
I love to gather inspirational stories
from the past and pass them on.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:26.693
Too often, I think history's what I call
the Mount Rushmore model.

00:08:26.717 --> 00:08:31.104
It looks majestic, but the women
have been entirely left out of it.

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:35.094
And I was giving a talk in 2015
about the suffragettes --

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:38.773
I'm sure you know those magnificent
women who fought so hard

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:41.907
for the right for women
in Britain to vote.

00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.266
And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.540
And boy, they succeeded,

00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:49.444
because women did indeed
get the vote in 1928.

00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:51.222
So I'm giving this talk about this,

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:53.842
and as I'm talking, what I realized is:

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.178
this was not a history
lecture I was giving;

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.694
this was not something
where the job was done.

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:02.346
This was something where
there was so much left to do.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.326
Nowhere in the world, for example,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.267
do women have equal representation
in positions of power.

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:11.529
OK, let's take a very quick look
at the top 100 companies

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:14.220
in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.

00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:17.738
Top 100 companies:
How many women running them?

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.627
Seven. OK. Seven.
That's all right, I suppose.

00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:25.412
Until you realize that 17
are run by men called "John."

00:09:25.436 --> 00:09:29.633
(Laughter)

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:41.245
There are more men called John
running FTSE 100 companies --

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:43.159
(Laughter)

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:44.718
than there are women.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.470
There are 14 run by men called "Dave."

00:09:47.494 --> 00:09:49.938
(Laughter)

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.676
Now, I'm sure Dave and John
are doing a bang-up job.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.988
(Laughter)

00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.862
OK. Why does it matter?

00:09:56.886 --> 00:10:01.185
Well, it's that pesky business
of the gender pay gap.

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:05.122
Nowhere in the world
do women earn the same as men.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.078
And that is never going to change

00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:10.725
unless we have more women
at the top in the boardroom.

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:12.135
We have plenty of laws;

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:16.212
the Equal Pay Act in Britain
was passed in 1975.

00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:19.120
Nevertheless, there are still
many, many women

00:10:19.144 --> 00:10:22.181
who, from early November
until the end of the year,

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.392
by comparison to their male colleagues,

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.188
are effectively working for free.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.088
In fact, the World Economic
Forum estimates

00:10:30.112 --> 00:10:32.555
that women will finally
get equal pay in ...

00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:34.738
2133!

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.553
Yay!

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:40.213
(Laughter)

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.648
That's a terrible figure.

00:10:44.672 --> 00:10:45.892
And here's the thing:

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:48.008
the day before I came out to give my talk,

00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:49.784
the World Economic Forum revised it.

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:52.168
So that's good, because
that's a terrible -- 2133.

00:10:52.192 --> 00:10:53.917
Do you know what they revised it to?

00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:55.131
2186.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.698
(Laughter)

00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:59.843
Yeah, another 53 years, OK?

00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:02.720
We are not going to get equal pay

00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:05.897
in my grandchildren's
grandchildren's lives

00:11:05.921 --> 00:11:07.303
under the current system.

00:11:07.327 --> 00:11:10.184
And I have waited long enough.

00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:12.272
I've waited long enough
in my own business.

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:16.310
In 2016 I became the very
first woman on British television

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:18.946
to host a prime-time panel show.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.006
Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.181
But --

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:23.498
(Applause)

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:26.849
But 2016! The first!

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:28.835
Television's been around for 80 years!

00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:29.871
(Laughter)

00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:31.843
It may be television's not so important,

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:33.810
but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.837
2016, the UN were looking
for a brand new ambassador

00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:40.652
to represent women's empowerment
and gender equality,

00:11:40.676 --> 00:11:42.152
and who did they choose?

00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:44.287
Wonder Woman.

00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.622
Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?

00:11:47.646 --> 00:11:48.847
(Laughter)

00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:52.719
Because no woman was up to the job.

00:11:53.718 --> 00:11:58.282
The representation of women
in positions of power is shockingly low.

00:11:58.306 --> 00:12:01.783
It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
true in the British Parliament.

00:12:01.807 --> 00:12:06.198
In 2015, the number of men
elected to the Parliament that year

00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:09.103
was greater than the total number of women

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:12.207
who have ever been members of Parliament.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.390
And why does it matter?

00:12:13.414 --> 00:12:15.677
Here's the thing:
if they're not at the table --

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:18.797
literally, in Britain, at that table
helping to make the laws --

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.344
do not be surprised if the female
perspective is overlooked.

00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:26.748
It's a great role model for young people
to see a woman in charge.

00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:29.861
In 2016, Britain got its second
female Prime Minister;

00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:31.524
Theresa May came to power.

00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:33.752
The day she came to power
she was challenged:

00:12:33.776 --> 00:12:34.970
just do one thing.

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:37.982
Do one thing in the first
100 days that you're in office

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:40.947
to try and improve
lives for women in Britain.

00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:42.968
And what did she do? Nothing.

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:44.293
Nothing.

00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:47.882
Because she's much too busy
cleaning up the mess the boys made.

00:12:48.492 --> 00:12:50.365
Even having a female leader,

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:53.383
they always find something better to do

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:56.694
than to sort out the pesky
issue of inequality.

00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:59.560
So I keep talking about equality
like it matters. Does it?

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:02.881
Well, let's take a very quick look
at the STEM industries, OK?

00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:05.472
So science, technology,
engineering and mathematics.

00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:10.113
Pretty much important in every
single aspect of our daily lives.

00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:16.441
There is the thickest and most incredibly
well-documented glass ceiling

00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.015
in the STEM industries.

00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:20.488
What if the cure for cancer

00:13:20.512 --> 00:13:22.113
or the answer the global warming

00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:27.082
lies in the head of a young female
scientist who fails to progress?

00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:30.553
So I thought all these things,

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:35.503
and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."

00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:37.939
And I spoke to my wonderful friend,

00:13:37.963 --> 00:13:40.690
brilliant journalist
Catherine Mayer in Britain,

00:13:40.714 --> 00:13:42.164
and we rather foolishly --

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:45.390
and I suspect there was wine involved --

00:13:45.414 --> 00:13:47.168
(Laughter)

00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:50.837
We decided to found
a brand new political party.

00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:52.487
Because here's the critical thing:

00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:57.409
the one place women and men
are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.

00:13:57.804 --> 00:13:59.425
We had no idea what we were doing,

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:02.547
we didn't know how complicated
it was to start a political party.

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:06.106
I thought, "It can't be that difficult,
men have been doing it for years."

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.287
(Laughter)

00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:13.597
So we started by calling it
"The Women's Equality Party."

00:14:14.143 --> 00:14:15.844
And straightaway people said to me,

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:17.322
"Why did you call it that?"

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.922
I said, "I don't know,
I just thought we'd be clear."

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:23.462
(Laughter)

00:14:27.878 --> 00:14:31.307
I didn't want what we were doing
to be a secret, you know? I just --

00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:32.624
(Laughter)

00:14:32.648 --> 00:14:35.874
Some people said, "You can't call it that!
It's much too feminist!"

00:14:35.898 --> 00:14:37.726
Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:41.256
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard somebody say,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.454
"I'm not a feminist, but ..."

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:46.440
And I always think
if there's a "but" in the sentence,

00:14:46.464 --> 00:14:48.233
it can't all be roses in the garden.

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:51.261
And then I started getting asked
the hilarious question,

00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:53.199
"Are you all going to burn your bras?"

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:57.581
Yes! Because bras are famously
made of flammable material.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.359
(Laughter)

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:02.850
That's why all women spark when they walk.

00:15:02.874 --> 00:15:04.603
(Laughter)

00:15:07.738 --> 00:15:11.038
Here's quick history sidebar for you:

00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:13.597
no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.443
It's a story made up by a journalist.

00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:18.092
Thank goodness journalism
has improved since then.

00:15:18.116 --> 00:15:19.271
So --

00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:20.653
(Laughter)

00:15:21.018 --> 00:15:23.936
I announced what we were going
to do in a broadcast interview,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.062
and straightaway,
the emails started coming.

00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:28.329
First hundreds,
then thousands and thousands,

00:15:28.353 --> 00:15:32.153
from every age group: from the very young
to women in their '90s,

00:15:32.177 --> 00:15:33.559
to hundreds of wonderful men.

00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.595
People wrote and said,
"Please, can I help?

00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:37.835
Please, can I visit you
at party headquarters?"

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:40.527
We didn't have a headquarters --
we didn't have a party!

00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:41.749
We didn't have anything.

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:45.672
All we had was a wonderful,
tight group of fabulous friends

00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:50.381
trying to answer emails
pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.

00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:52.242
We were all busy.

00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:54.552
Many of us had careers,
many of us had children,

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.311
but we did what women do,
and we shared the work.

00:15:57.335 --> 00:16:00.773
And almost instantly, we agreed
on certain fundamental things.

00:16:00.797 --> 00:16:04.289
First thing: we want to be
the only political party in the world

00:16:04.313 --> 00:16:07.018
whose main aim was
to no longer need to exist.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:08.847
That's a fantastic idea.

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:12.701
We wanted to be the only political party
with no particular political leaning.

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:15.822
We wanted people from the left,
from the right, from the middle,

00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:16.998
every age group.

00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:19.837
Because the whole point
was to work with a simple agenda:

00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:23.080
let's get equality
in every aspect of our lives,

00:16:23.104 --> 00:16:24.260
and when we're finished,

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:26.519
let's go home and get
the other chores done.

00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:27.625
(Laughter)

00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:30.056
And we wanted to change
how politics is conducted.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.563
I don't know if you have this,

00:16:31.587 --> 00:16:34.024
but in Britain we have
two major political parties.

00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:35.696
They're the dinosaurs of politics.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.258
And how they speak to each other
is shameful and poisonous.

00:16:39.735 --> 00:16:42.353
I'm sure you've never had
that kind of name-calling --

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.722
(Laughter)

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.163
And lying here.

00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:49.436
Wouldn't it be great
if just one politician said,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.355
"Do you know, my opponent has a point.

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:54.778
Let's see if we can't work together
and get the job done."

00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:59.319
(Applause)

00:17:01.163 --> 00:17:03.576
And let's get more women
into politics, OK?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.774
Let's immediately get
more women into politics

00:17:05.798 --> 00:17:09.484
by being the only political party
to offer free childcare to our candidates,

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:12.181
so they can get out of the house
and start campaigning.

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:14.461
(Applause)

00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:18.022
Within 10 months,

00:17:18.046 --> 00:17:21.994
we had more than 70 branches
of our party across the UK.

00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:25.177
We stood candidates for election
in London, Scotland and Wales

00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:26.765
in May 2016.

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:30.334
One in 20 people voted
for our candidate for London Mayor.

00:17:30.358 --> 00:17:35.551
And when the men in the race
saw how many votes we were attracting,

00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:36.749
wonder of wonders,

00:17:36.773 --> 00:17:41.103
they began to talk about the need
to tackle gender equality.

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:44.187
(Applause)

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:50.236
You know, I've been promised
change since I was a child.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.317
It was always coming:

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:54.039
women were going to stand
shoulder to shoulder with men.

00:17:54.063 --> 00:17:56.546
All I got were empty promises
and disappointment --

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.940
enough disappointment
to found a political party.

00:17:59.964 --> 00:18:03.070
But here is my new idea for today --
this is my five percent, OK?

00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:04.693
And this one is really good.

00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:07.463
The fact is, this is not enough.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:12.549
It is not enough to found one political
party for equality in a single country.

00:18:12.573 --> 00:18:17.120
What we need is a seismic change
in the global political landscape.

00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:19.838
And the wonderful thing
about the model we have created

00:18:19.862 --> 00:18:21.737
is that it would work anywhere.

00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:23.421
It would work in America,

00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:25.839
it would work in Australia,
it would work in India.

00:18:25.863 --> 00:18:28.770
It's like we've made the perfect recipe:
anybody can cook it,

00:18:28.794 --> 00:18:30.190
and it's good for everybody.

00:18:30.214 --> 00:18:31.837
And we want to give it away.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.579
If you want to know what we did,
we're giving it away.

00:18:34.603 --> 00:18:40.217
Can you imagine if we could mobilize
millions of women across the world

00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:43.559
to say, "That's enough!"
to the traditional battles of politics?

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:46.617
To say, "Stop the bickering,
let's get the work done."

00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:49.948
We could literally change the world.

00:18:49.972 --> 00:18:51.389
And I want that.

00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:54.825
(Applause)

00:18:56.707 --> 00:18:58.080
I want ...

00:18:58.104 --> 00:18:59.555
(Applause)

00:19:00.044 --> 00:19:02.514
I want that for our daughters,

00:19:02.538 --> 00:19:04.041
and I want it for our sons.

00:19:04.065 --> 00:19:08.457
Because the fact is:
equality is better for everyone.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.412
Come on people, let's activate!
Let's change the world!

00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:14.292
I know we can do it, and it wants doing!

00:19:14.316 --> 00:19:18.815
(Applause)
