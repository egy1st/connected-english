WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.520
I'd like to try something new.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.736
Those of you who are able,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.960
please stand up.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.600
OK, so I'm going to name some names.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.456
When you hear a name
that you don't recognize,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.335
you can't tell me anything about them,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.136
I'd like you to take a seat

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.480
and stay seated.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.856
The last person standing,
we're going to see what they know. OK?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.456
(Laughter)

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.680
All right.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.360
Eric Garner.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.760
Mike Brown.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.520
Tamir Rice.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.960
Freddie Gray.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.136
So those of you who are still standing,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.256
I'd like you to turn around
and take a look.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.280
I'd say half to most of the people
are still standing.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.120
So let's continue.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.000
Michelle Cusseaux.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.640
Tanisha Anderson.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.640
Aura Rosser.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.800
Meagan Hockaday.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.216
So if we look around again,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.256
there are about four people
still standing,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.976
and actually I'm not going
to put you on the spot.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.576
I just say that to encourage transparency,
so you can be seated.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280
(Laughter)

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.776
So those of you who recognized
the first group of names know

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.696
that these were African-Americans
who have been killed by the police

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.920
over the last two and a half years.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.416
What you may not know

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.856
is that the other list
is also African-Americans

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
who have been killed
within the last two years.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.656
Only one thing distinguishes
the names that you know

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.360
from the names that you don't know:

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.520
gender.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.536
So let me first let you know
that there's nothing at all distinct

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.336
about this audience

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.176
that explains the pattern of recognition
that we've just seen.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.696
I've done this exercise
dozens of times around the country.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.296
I've done it to women's
rights organizations.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.456
I've done it with civil rights groups.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.456
I've done it with professors.
I've done it with students.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.736
I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.256
I've done it even with
progressive members of Congress.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.576
And everywhere, the awareness
of the level of police violence

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.496
that black women experience

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
is exceedingly low.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.176
Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
that this would be the case.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.216
I mean, there are two issues
involved here.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.336
There's police violence
against African-Americans,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.416
and there's violence against women,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400
two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.096
But when we think about
who is implicated by these problems,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.616
when we think about
who is victimized by these problems,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720
the names of these black women
never come to mind.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.416
Now, communications experts tell us

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.896
that when facts do not fit
with the available frames,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.656
people have a difficult time
incorporating new facts

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.960
into their way of thinking
about a problem.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.336
These women's names
have slipped through our consciousness

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.776
because there are no frames
for us to see them,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.096
no frames for us to remember them,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.080
no frames for us to hold them.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.840
As a consequence,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.440
reporters don't lead with them,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.376
policymakers don't think about them,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.800
and politicians aren't encouraged
or demanded that they speak to them.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.416
Now, you might ask,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.016
why does a frame matter?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.856
I mean, after all,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.176
an issue that affects black people
and an issue that affects women,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.256
wouldn't that necessarily include
black people who are women

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.560
and women who are black people?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.776
Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.800
and many times it just doesn't work.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.776
Without frames that allow us to see

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.536
how social problems impact
all the members of a targeted group,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.776
many will fall through the cracks
of our movements,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.240
left to suffer in virtual isolation.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.280
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.216
Many years ago, I began to use
the term "intersectionality"

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.336
to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.256
like racism and sexism

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.480
are often overlapping,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.040
creating multiple levels
of social injustice.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.416
Now, the experience
that gave rise to intersectionality

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.400
was my chance encounter
with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.056
Emma DeGraffenreid
was an African-American woman,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.776
a working wife and a mother.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.216
I actually read about Emma's story
from the pages of a legal opinion

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.376
written by a judge
who had dismissed Emma's claim

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.496
of race and gender discrimination

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.720
against a local car manufacturing plant.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.176
Emma, like so many African-American women,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.976
sought better employment
for her family and for others.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.416
She wanted to create a better life
for her children and for her family.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.656
But she applied for a job,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.376
and she was not hired,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.040
and she believed that she was not hired
because she was a black woman.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.416
Now, the judge in question
dismissed Emma's suit,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.016
and the argument
for dismissing the suit was

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.376
that the employer
did hire African-Americans

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.760
and the employer hired women.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.416
The real problem, though, that the judge
was not willing to acknowledge

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.616
was what Emma was actually trying to say,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.536
that the African-Americans
that were hired,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.320
usually for industrial jobs,
maintenance jobs, were all men.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.216
And the women that were hired,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.856
usually for secretarial
or front-office work,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.080
were all white.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.456
Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.136
would he be able to see
the double discrimination

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.280
that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.456
But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.856
to tell her story

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.816
because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.776
she would be able
to have preferential treatment.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.016
She would have an advantage
by having two swings at the bat,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.680
when African-American men and white women
only had one swing at the bat.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.456
But of course, neither
African-American men or white women

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.056
needed to combine a race
and gender discrimination claim

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.440
to tell the story of the discrimination
they were experiencing.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.496
Why wasn't the real unfairness

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.656
law's refusal to protect
African-American women

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.776
simply because their experiences
weren't exactly the same

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.560
as white women and African-American men?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.536
Rather than broadening the frame
to include African-American women,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.840
the court simply tossed their case
completely out of court.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.056
Now, as a student
of antidiscrimination law,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.536
as a feminist,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.936
as an antiracist,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.176
I was struck by this case.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.856
It felt to me like injustice squared.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.976
So first of all,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.840
black women weren't allowed
to work at the plant.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.616
Second of all, the court
doubled down on this exclusion

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.000
by making it legally inconsequential.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.880
And to boot, there was
no name for this problem.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.096
And we all know that,
where there's no name for a problem,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.376
you can't see a problem,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.600
and when you can't see a problem,
you pretty much can't solve it.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.775
Many years later, I had come to recognize

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:46.400
that the problem that Emma was facing
was a framing problem.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.096
The frame that the court was using

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.096
to see gender discrimination
or to see race discrimination

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.040
was partial, and it was distorting.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.776
For me, the challenge that I faced was

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.616
trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.336
a prism that would allow us
to see Emma's dilemma,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.296
a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.600
that would allow judges to see her story.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.896
So it occurred to me,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.936
maybe a simple analogy to an intersection

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.240
might allow judges
to better see Emma's dilemma.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.696
So if we think about this intersection,
the roads to the intersection would be

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.640
the way that the workforce
was structured by race and by gender.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.856
And then the traffic in those roads
would be the hiring policies

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.416
and the other practices
that ran through those roads.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.376
Now, because Emma
was both black and female,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.080
she was positioned precisely
where those roads overlapped,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.976
experiencing the simultaneous impact

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.960
of the company's gender and race traffic.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:19.176
The law -- the law is
like that ambulance that shows up

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.616
and is ready to treat Emma
only if it can be shown

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.256
that she was harmed
on the race road or on the gender road

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.120
but not where those roads intersected.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.176
So what do you call
being impacted by multiple forces

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.760
and then abandoned to fend for yourself?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.360
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.776
I would go on to learn
that African-American women,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.736
like other women of color,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.816
like other socially marginalized people
all over the world,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.816
were facing all kinds
of dilemmas and challenges

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.936
as a consequence of intersectionality,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.536
intersections of race and gender,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.776
of heterosexism, transphobia,
xenophobia, ableism,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.376
all of these social dynamics come together

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.640
and create challenges
that are sometimes quite unique.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.856
But in the same way

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.440
that intersectionality

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.280
raised our awareness to the way
that black women live their lives,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.416
it also exposes the tragic circumstances

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.600
under which African-American women die.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.960
Police violence against black women

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.320
is very real.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.576
The level of violence
that black women face

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.760
is such that it's not surprising

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.960
that some of them do not survive
their encounters with police.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.656
Black girls as young as seven,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.400
great grandmothers as old as 95

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.280
have been killed by the police.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.000
They've been killed in their living rooms,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.000
in their bedrooms.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.720
They've been killed in their cars.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.736
They've been killed on the street.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.616
They've been killed
in front of their parents

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.440
and they've been killed
in front of their children.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.800
They have been shot to death.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.960
They have been stomped to death.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.840
They have been suffocated to death.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.496
They have been manhandled to death.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.000
They have been tasered to death.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.160
They've been killed
when they've called for help.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.656
They've been killed when they were alone,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.800
and they've been killed
when they were with others.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.640
They've been killed shopping while black,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.000
driving while black,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.520
having a mental disability while black,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.920
having a domestic disturbance while black.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.080
They've even been killed
being homeless while black.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.816
They've been killed
talking on the cell phone,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.216
laughing with friends,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.296
sitting in a car reported as stolen

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.936
and making a U-turn
in front of the White House

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.800
with an infant strapped
in the backseat of the car.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.840
Why don't we know these stories?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.640
Why is it that their lost lives

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.176
don't generate the same amount
of media attention and communal outcry

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.360
as the lost lives
of their fallen brothers?

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.760
It's time for a change.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.480
So what can we do?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.176
In 2014, the African-American
Policy Forum began to demand

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.440
that we "say her name"

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.200
at rallies, at protests,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.616
at conferences, at meetings,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.256
anywhere and everywhere

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.280
that state violence against black bodies
is being discussed.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.456
But saying her name is not enough.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.056
We have to be willing to do more.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.296
We have to be willing to bear witness,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.936
to bear witness
to the often painful realities

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.696
that we would just rather not confront,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.176
the everyday violence and humiliation
that many black women have had to face,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.576
black women across color,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.016
age, gender expression,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.320
sexuality and ability.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.216
So we have the opportunity right now --

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.256
bearing in mind that some of the images
that I'm about to share with you

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.000
may be triggering for some --

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.600
to collectively bear witness
to some of this violence.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.400
We're going to hear the voice
of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.160
And as we sit with these women,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.960
some who have experienced violence
and some who have not survived them,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.896
we have an opportunity

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.656
to reverse what happened
at the beginning of this talk,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.376
when we could not stand for these women

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.760
because we did not know their names.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.040
So at the end of this clip,
there's going to be a roll call.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.160
Several black women's names will come up.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.736
I'd like those of you who are able
to join us in saying these names

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.136
as loud as you can,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.896
randomly, disorderly.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.720
Let's create a cacophony of sound

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.720
to represent our intention

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.520
to hold these women up,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.936
to sit with them,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.680
to bear witness to them,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.240
to bring them into the light.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.920
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.360
say her name.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.760
Say,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.256
say her name.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.480
(Audience) Shelly!

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.816
(Audience) Kayla!

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.280
AD: Oh,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.856
say her name.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.416
(Audience shouting names)

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.400
Say, say,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.520
say her name.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.656
Say her name.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.536
For all the names

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.880
I'll never know,

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.776
say her name.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.576
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,
Janisha Fonville,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.936
Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.816
Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.280
Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:55.520
AD: Say her name.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.896
KC: So I said at the beginning,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.680
if we can't see a problem,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.320
we can't fix a problem.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.976
Together, we've come together
to bear witness

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.080
to these women's lost lives.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.616
But the time now is to move

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.136
from mourning and grief

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.920
to action and transformation.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.360
This is something that we can do.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.840
It's up to us.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.736
Thank you for joining us.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.976
Thank you.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.320
(Applause)
