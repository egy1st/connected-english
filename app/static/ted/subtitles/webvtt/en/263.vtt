WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I write about food. I write about cooking.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I take it quite seriously,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I'm here to talk about something

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I still think that this --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
-- may be this year's version of this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And why do I say it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because only once before has the fate of individual people

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the fate of all of humanity

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
been so intertwined.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There was the bomb, and there's now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And where we go from here is going to determine

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we'd recognize it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's a holocaust of a different kind,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Start with the notion that global warming

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is not only real, but dangerous.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we can take this is a given.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then hear this, please.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to atmosphere-altering gases.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is generated by livestock production --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
more than transportation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and it's not just methane.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There's more.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Like half the antibiotics in this country

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
are not administered to people, but to animals.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
if you're a progressive,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or you're looking for organic,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but it's all in the way we use these things.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
There's another piece of the puzzle,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and one you already know.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
are diseases that are far more prevalent here

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
than anywhere in the rest of the world.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now global warming was unforeseen.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
but, you know, that's not such a big deal.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The current health crisis, however,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is a little more the work of the evil empire.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We were told, we were assured,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the healthier we'd be.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Not bad.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But back to animals and junk food.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
What do they have in common?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
One: we don't need either of them for health.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We don't need animal products,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Two: both have been marketed heavily,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
creating unnatural demand.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now, let's imagine a parallel.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
knowing all the while that the result would be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
pollution, war and rising costs.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Incredible, isn't it?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yet they do that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And they do this here. It's the same deal.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
is that even when well-intentioned Feds

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
try to do right by us, they fail.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
or they are puppets of agribusiness.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
along with more carbs.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and that plants and whole grains

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
should be supplanting eating junk food.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And guess what?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Half the people who developed the food pyramid

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
have ties to agribusiness.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
our swollen appetites simply became larger,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
these are not solutions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But with lots of intelligent people

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
focusing on whether food is organic or local,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
or whether we're being nice to animals,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I like animals,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and to churn them out like they were wrenches.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But there's no way to treat animals well,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That's our number. 10 billion.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
If you strung all of them --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
they'd go there and back five times, there and back.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
but you get the idea.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That's just the United States.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Seriously.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And locavore, for those of you who don't know,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is someone who eats only locally grown food --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which is fine if you live in California,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and the hip locavore vision,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
(Laughter).

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
They both get it wrong, though.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And I'm going to go through that,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
A hundred years ago, guess what?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And those moms bought and prepared food.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Margarine didn't exist.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
In fact, when margarine was invented,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so we'd all know that it was a fake.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There were no restaurant chains.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
but none of them would think to open another one.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And fancy food was entirely French.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
As an aside, those of you who remember

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Back in those days, before even Julia,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You just ate.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You didn't claim to be anything.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Vitamins had not been invented.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
You ate food.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because it was an ingredient.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The cornflake hadn't been invented.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Goldfish swam.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And again, everyone ate local.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
because it came all the way from Florida.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
trucks took the place of railroads,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
fresh food began to travel more.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Oranges became common in New York.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The South and West became agricultural hubs,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
as is almost everything

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
from the demise of the real community

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Thus arrived convenience.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
as a way to cut down on housework.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
their mouths are watering at this point.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
(Laughter)

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(Applause)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(Laughter)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But this may have cut down on housework,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
than broiling a steak?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
for which their stomachs were designed,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they were forced to eat soy and corn.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but that wasn't a problem for producers.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
New drugs kept them healthy.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Well, they kept them alive.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Healthy was another story.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Thanks to farm subsidies,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
soy, corn and cattle became king.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It was during this period that the cycle of

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
dietary and planetary destruction began,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
the thing we're only realizing just now.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Listen to this,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Meat consumption increased five-fold.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
because all of them could be bought at any store.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Not that they were any good, but they were there.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Most moms cooked like mine:

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
canned soup, canned fruit salad.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It wasn't all bad.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
By the '70s, forward-thinking people

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
we knew or we were vegetarians.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We weren't all hippies, either.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
as if it were plastic,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Many people became fat-phobic.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Instead they were sold on yogurt,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You think that that might be healthy food,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
if not actually killed --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
which contained as many soy and corn products

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
as could be crammed into it.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and then it's fried in corn oil.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And zapped horribly, pathetically.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that the high fat and spice contents of foods

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and we all have our favorites, actually --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
made this stuff more appealing than the bland things

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that people were serving at home.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and cooking simply wasn't important enough

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
for men to share the burden.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
you've got your grazing nights,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Meat, junk food, cheese:

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the very stuff that will kill you.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So, now we clamor for organic food.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
That's good.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And as evidence that things can actually change,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
you can now find organic food in supermarkets,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and even in fast-food outlets.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But organic food isn't the answer either,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
at least not the way it's currently defined.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Let me pose you a question.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Can farm-raised salmon be organic,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I don't know.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Packed in Styrofoam, of course,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
before landing somewhere in the United States,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Now here is where we all meet.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
the vegans, the gourmets

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Even though we've come to this from different points,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
we all have to act on our knowledge

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
to change the way that everyone thinks about food.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We need to start acting.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and, of course, she's completely right --

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
but it's also one of global survival.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
are attributed to livestock production.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
How much livestock do you need to produce this?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to raising the animals we'll eat.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And if the numbers coming in from China

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
are anything like what they look like now,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it's not going to be 40 years.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Isn't meat eating essential to health?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
(Laughter)

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
the answer is no.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and many will make you much healthier than ours does.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Americans eat 50 percent less meat --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and what progressive people, forward-thinking people

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
should be doing and advocating,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
During that time, I've eaten

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and recommended eating just about everything.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
the time has come to stop raising them industrially

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
and stop eating them thoughtlessly.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Ann Cooper's right.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
The USDA is not our ally here.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
We have to take matters into our own hands,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And that happens to be quite easy.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Less meat, less junk, more plants.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It's a simple formula: eat food.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Eat real food.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and we can eat even better.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We can make food more important, not less,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and save ourselves by doing so.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
We have to choose that path.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Thank you.
