00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:04.696
(Music)

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.416
Roughly 43,000 years ago,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.416
a young cave bear
died in the rolling hills

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.816
on the northwest border
of modern day Slovenia.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.936
A thousand years later,
a mammoth died in southern Germany.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.256
A few centuries after that,
a griffon vulture also died

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.480
in the same vicinity.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.416
And we know almost nothing
about how these animals met their deaths,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.496
but these different creatures
dispersed across both time and space

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.696
did share one remarkable fate.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.176
After their deaths,
a bone from each of their skeletons

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.896
was crafted by human hands

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.120
into a flute.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.376
Think about that for a second.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.056
Imagine you're a caveman,
40,000 years ago.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.736
You've mastered fire.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.816
You've built simple tools for hunting.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.456
You've learned how to craft
garments from animal skins

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.536
to keep yourself warm in the winter.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.296
What would you choose to invent next?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.456
It seems preposterous
that you would invent the flute,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.296
a tool that created
useless vibrations in air molecules.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.320
But that is exactly
what our ancestors did.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.616
Now this turns out
to be surprisingly common

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.256
in the history of innovation.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.216
Sometimes people invent things

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.176
because they want to stay alive
or feed their children

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.336
or conquer the village next door.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.776
But just as often,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.696
new ideas come into the world

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.760
simply because they're fun.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.936
And here's the really strange thing:

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.216
many of those playful
but seemingly frivolous inventions

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.856
ended up sparking
momentous transformations

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.976
in science, in politics and society.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.936
Take what may be the most
important invention of modern times:

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.696
programmable computers.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.336
Now, the standard story is that computers
descend from military technology,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.216
since many of the early computers
were designed specifically

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.696
to crack wartime codes
or calculate rocket trajectories.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.216
But in fact, the origins
of the modern computer

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.896
are much more playful,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.216
even musical,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.496
than you might imagine.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.776
The idea behind the flute,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.896
of just pushing air through tubes
to make a sound,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.816
was eventually modified
to create the first organ

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.576
more than 2,000 years ago.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.896
Someone came up with the brilliant idea
of triggering sounds

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.816
by pressing small levers with our fingers,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.216
inventing the first musical keyboard.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.376
Now, keyboards evolved
from organs to clavichords to harpsichords

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.736
to the piano,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.416
until the middle of the 19th century,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.216
when a bunch of inventors
finally hit on the idea

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.136
of using a keyboard
to trigger not sounds but letters.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.456
In fact, the very first typewriter

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.640
was originally called
"the writing harpsichord."

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.256
Flutes and music led
to even more powerful breakthroughs.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.016
About a thousand years ago,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.256
at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.616
three brothers in Baghdad
designed a device

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.136
that was an automated organ.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.040
They called it "the instrument
that plays itself."

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.096
Now, the instrument
was basically a giant music box.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.456
The organ could be trained to play
various songs by using instructions

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680
encoded by placing pins
on a rotating cylinder.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.056
And if you wanted the machine
to play a different song,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040
you just swapped a new cylinder in
with a different code on it.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.216
This instrument was the first of its kind.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.976
It was programmable.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.056
Now, conceptually,
this was a massive leap forward.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.496
The whole idea of hardware and software

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.736
becomes thinkable for the first time
with this invention.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.216
And that incredibly powerful concept

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.416
didn't come to us as an instrument
of war or of conquest,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.136
or necessity at all.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.296
It came from the strange delight
of watching a machine play music.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.536
In fact, the idea of programmable machines

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.216
was exclusively kept alive by music
for about 700 years.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.736
In the 1700s, music-making machines

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.336
became the playthings
of the Parisian elite.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.536
Showmen used the same coded cylinders

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.496
to control the physical movements
of what were called automata,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.536
an early kind of robot.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.496
One of the most famous of those robots

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.896
was, you guessed it,
an automated flute player

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.816
designed by a brilliant French inventor

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.125
named Jacques de Vaucanson.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.776
And as de Vaucanson
was designing his robot musician,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.736
he had another idea.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.736
If you could program a machine
to make pleasing sounds,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.400
why not program it to weave
delightful patterns of color out of cloth?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.176
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder
to represent musical notes,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.296
they would represent
threads with different colors.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.816
If you wanted a new pattern
for your fabric,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.520
you just programmed a new cylinder.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.840
This was the first programmable loom.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.736
Now, the cylinders were too expensive
and time-consuming to make,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.296
but a half century later,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.936
another French inventor named Jacquard

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.656
hit upon the brilliant idea
of using paper-punched cards

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.456
instead of metal cylinders.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.536
Paper turned out to be
much cheaper and more flexible

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.696
as a way of programming the device.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.176
That punch card system inspired
Victorian inventor Charles Babbage

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.696
to create his analytical engine,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.336
the first true programmable computer

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.696
ever designed.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.416
And punch cards were used
by computer programmers

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.520
as late as the 1970s.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.776
So ask yourself this question:

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.296
what really made
the modern computer possible?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.336
Yes, the military involvement
is an important part of the story,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.096
but inventing a computer
also required other building blocks:

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.336
music boxes,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.376
toy robot flute players,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.896
harpsichord keyboards,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.496
colorful patterns woven into fabric,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.336
and that's just a small part of the story.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.336
There's a long list of world-changing
ideas and technologies

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.056
that came out of play:

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.056
public museums, rubber,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.416
probability theory, the insurance business

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.656
and many more.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.400
Necessity isn't always
the mother of invention.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.256
The playful state of mind
is fundamentally exploratory,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.240
seeking out new possibilities
in the world around us.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.416
And that seeking
is why so many experiences

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.456
that started with simple
delight and amusement

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.240
eventually led us
to profound breakthroughs.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.256
Now, I think this has implications
for how we teach kids in school

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.640
and how we encourage innovation
in our workspaces,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.576
but thinking about play
and delight this way

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.136
also helps us detect what's coming next.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.536
Think about it: if you were
sitting there in 1750

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.096
trying to figure out
the big changes coming to society

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.016
in the 19th, the 20th centuries,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.096
automated machines, computers,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.056
artificial intelligence,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.896
a programmable flute

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.096
entertaining the Parisian elite

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.920
would have been as powerful a clue
as anything else at the time.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.376
It seemed like an amusement at best,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.136
not useful in any serious way,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.016
but it turned out to be
the beginning of a tech revolution

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.896
that would change the world.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.776
You'll find the future

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800
wherever people are having the most fun.
