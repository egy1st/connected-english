00:00:01.441 --> 00:00:03.857
Speaking up is hard to do.

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:09.507
I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago,

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.434
when my wife and I became new parents.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.791
It was an amazing moment.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.000
It was exhilarating and elating,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.345
but it was also scary and terrifying.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.571
And it got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital,

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.056
and we were unsure

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.169
whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding.

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.943
And we wanted to call our pediatrician,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.542
but we also didn't want
to make a bad first impression

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.030
or come across as a crazy,
neurotic parent.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:40.701
So we worried.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.107
And we waited.

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.426
When we got to the doctor's office
the next day,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.704
she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated.

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:50.746
Our son is fine now,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.726
and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:55.632
But in that moment,

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.290
I should've spoken up, but I didn't.

00:00:58.943 --> 00:01:02.238
But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:06.188
and I learned that over 10 years ago
when I let my twin brother down.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.221
My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker,

00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:10.775
and for one of his first films,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.414
he got an offer
from a distribution company.

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:14.776
He was excited,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.467
and he was inclined to accept the offer.

00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:19.584
But as a negotiations researcher,

00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:22.561
I insisted he make a counteroffer,

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.815
and I helped him craft the perfect one.

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:27.520
And it was perfect --

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:29.548
it was perfectly insulting.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.136
The company was so offended,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.209
they literally withdrew the offer

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.450
and my brother was left with nothing.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:40.334
And I've asked people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up:

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:42.192
when they can assert themselves,

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:43.930
when they can push their interests,

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:46.149
when they can express an opinion,

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.384
when they can make an ambitious ask.

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:53.120
And the range of stories
are varied and diverse,

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:55.815
but they also make up
a universal tapestry.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.517
Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake?

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:02.644
Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes?

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:06.063
Can I challenge my friend's
insensitive joke?

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.486
Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities?

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.676
And through these experiences,
I've come to recognize

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.557
that each of us have something called
a range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:22.832
Now, sometimes we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much.

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:24.619
That's what happened with my brother.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:29.269
Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior.

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.187
But sometimes we're too weak.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:33.275
That's what happened with my wife and I.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.515
And this range of acceptable behaviors --

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.634
when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.827
When we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways.

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.990
We get dismissed or demeaned
or even ostracized.

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:49.273
Or we lose that raise
or that promotion or that deal.

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.693
Now, the first thing we need to know is:

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.205
What is my range?

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:58.689
But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed;

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:00.681
it's actually pretty dynamic.

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:04.961
It expands and it narrows
based on the context.

00:03:05.344 --> 00:03:09.472
And there's one thing that determines
that range more than anything else,

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.331
and that's your power.

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:13.512
Your power determines your range.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:14.973
What is power?

00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:16.764
Power comes in lots of forms.

00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:19.877
In negotiations, it comes
in the form of alternatives.

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.901
So my brother had no alternatives;

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:23.112
he lacked power.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.956
The company had lots of alternatives;

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.146
they had power.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.230
Sometimes it's being new
to a country, like an immigrant,

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:30.713
or new to an organization

00:03:30.737 --> 00:03:32.296
or new to an experience,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.425
like my wife and I as new parents.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.950
Sometimes it's at work,

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:38.585
where someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.293
Sometimes it's in relationships,

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:43.298
where one person's more invested
than the other person.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:46.837
And the key thing is that when
we have lots of power,

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:48.690
our range is very wide.

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:51.345
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:54.141
But when we lack power, our range narrows.

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:56.332
We have very little leeway.

00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:59.729
The problem is that when
our range narrows,

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:03.856
that produces something called
the low-power double bind.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.983
The low-power double bind happens

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:09.944
when, if we don't speak up,
we go unnoticed,

00:04:10.576 --> 00:04:12.918
but if we do speak up, we get punished.

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.070
Now, many of you have heard
the phrase the "double bind"

00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:19.041
and connected it with one thing,
and that's gender.

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:23.275
The gender double bind is women
who don't speak up go unnoticed,

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:25.730
and women who do speak up get punished.

00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:31.111
And the key thing is that women have
the same need as men to speak up,

00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:33.032
but they have barriers to doing so.

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:37.282
But what my research has shown
over the last two decades

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.587
is that what looks
like a gender difference

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:43.432
is not really a gender double bind,

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.812
it's a really a low-power double bind.

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:47.720
And what looks like a gender difference

00:04:47.744 --> 00:04:50.850
are really often just power
differences in disguise.

00:04:51.394 --> 00:04:54.117
Oftentimes we see a difference
between a man and a woman

00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:55.339
or men and women,

00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:58.971
and think, "Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.241
about the sexes."

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.119
But in study after study,

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:06.349
I've found that a better explanation
for many sex differences

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:08.405
is really power.

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.496
And so it's the low-power double bind.

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:16.791
And the low-power double bind
means that we have a narrow range,

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.645
and we lack power.

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.901
We have a narrow range,

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.847
and our double bind is very large.

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.691
So we need to find ways
to expand our range.

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:26.292
And over the last couple decades,

00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:29.297
my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:33.892
The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes.

00:05:34.284 --> 00:05:37.605
The second: you seem powerful
in the eyes of others.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.484
When I feel powerful,

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:41.992
I feel confident, not fearful;

00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:43.858
I expand my own range.

00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:46.028
When other people see me as powerful,

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:49.150
they grant me a wider range.

00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:53.928
So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior.

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:56.343
And I'm going to give you
a set of tools today.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.985
Speaking up is risky,

00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:02.432
but these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up.

00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:08.901
The first tool I'm going to give you
got discovered in negotiations

00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:10.305
in an important finding.

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:14.225
On average, women make
less ambitious offers

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.723
and get worse outcomes than men
at the bargaining table.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.317
But Hannah Riley Bowles
and Emily Amanatullah have discovered

00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:25.019
there's one situation
where women get the same outcomes as men

00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:26.642
and are just as ambitious.

00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:30.804
That's when they advocate for others.

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.388
When they advocate for others,

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:38.289
they discover their own range
and expand it in their own mind.

00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:39.722
They become more assertive.

00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:42.620
This is sometimes called
"the mama bear effect."

00:06:43.483 --> 00:06:45.742
Like a mama bear defending her cubs,

00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:49.714
when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice.

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:53.445
But sometimes, we have
to advocate for ourselves.

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:54.809
How do we do that?

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:58.838
One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves

00:06:58.862 --> 00:07:01.234
is something called perspective-taking.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:04.010
And perspective-taking is really simple:

00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:08.319
it's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person.

00:07:09.014 --> 00:07:12.802
It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range.

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.533
When I take your perspective,

00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:16.996
and I think about what you really want,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.390
you're more likely to give me
what I really want.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:22.961
But here's the problem:

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.266
perspective-taking is hard to do.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.820
So let's do a little experiment.

00:07:26.844 --> 00:07:29.858
I want you all to hold
your hand just like this:

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.177
your finger -- put it up.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.002
And I want you to draw
a capital letter E on your forehead

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:37.607
as quickly as possible.

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:43.383
OK, it turns out that we can
draw this E in one of two ways,

00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:46.892
and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking.

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.837
I'm going to show you two pictures

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.861
of someone with an E on their forehead --

00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:52.743
my former student, Erika Hall.

00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.262
And you can see over here,

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:56.553
that's the correct E.

00:07:56.577 --> 00:08:00.027
I drew the E so it looks like
an E to another person.

00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.158
That's the perspective-taking E

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:05.237
because it looks like an E
from someone else's vantage point.

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:08.271
But this E over here
is the self-focused E.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.509
We often get self-focused.

00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:13.500
And we particularly get
self-focused in a crisis.

00:08:14.064 --> 00:08:16.235
I want to tell you
about a particular crisis.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:19.263
A man walks into a bank
in Watsonville, California.

00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:22.724
And he says, "Give me $2,000,

00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:25.044
or I'm blowing the whole bank
up with a bomb."

00:08:25.503 --> 00:08:28.028
Now, the bank manager
didn't give him the money.

00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:29.351
She took a step back.

00:08:29.873 --> 00:08:31.329
She took his perspective,

00:08:31.353 --> 00:08:33.720
and she noticed something
really important.

00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:36.450
He asked for a specific amount of money.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.679
So she said,

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.928
"Why did you ask for $2,000?"

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.633
And he said, "My friend
is going to be evicted

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.920
unless I get him $2,000 immediately."

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:48.994
And she said, "Oh! You don't want
to rob the bank --

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:50.506
you want to take out a loan."

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.615
(Laughter)

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.512
"Why don't you come back to my office,

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:55.715
and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:56.778
(Laughter)

00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:01.717
Now, her quick perspective-taking
defused a volatile situation.

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:04.095
So when we take someone's perspective,

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:08.725
it allows us to be ambitious
and assertive, but still be likable.

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:12.450
Here's another way to be assertive
but still be likable,

00:09:12.474 --> 00:09:15.005
and that is to signal flexibility.

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:19.475
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,
and you want to sell someone a car.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.793
You're going to more likely make the sale
if you give them two options.

00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:25.564
Let's say option A:

00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:28.688
$24,000 for this car
and a five-year warranty.

00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:30.257
Or option B:

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:33.493
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.

00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:37.423
My research shows that when you give
people a choice among options,

00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:39.336
it lowers their defenses,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.558
and they're more likely
to accept your offer.

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.319
And this doesn't just
work with salespeople;

00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:45.534
it works with parents.

00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:46.837
When my niece was four,

00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:49.778
she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.688
But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea.

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:55.630
What if I gave my daughter a choice?

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:57.675
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:59.821
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.

00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:01.183
And it worked brilliantly.

00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:04.741
She got dressed quickly
and without resistance.

00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:07.785
When I've asked the question
around the world

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:09.860
when people feel comfortable speaking up,

00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:11.220
the number one answer is:

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:15.998
"When I have social support
in my audience; when I have allies."

00:10:16.022 --> 00:10:19.568
So we want to get allies on our side.

00:10:19.957 --> 00:10:21.227
How do we do that?

00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:24.010
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.

00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:25.510
When we advocate for others,

00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:29.063
we expand our range in our own eyes
and the eyes of others,

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.243
but we also earn strong allies.

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:36.513
Another way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places,

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:39.386
is by asking other people for advice.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:45.291
When we ask others for advice,
they like us because we flatter them,

00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.802
and we're expressing humility.

00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:50.477
And this really works to solve
another double bind.

00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:53.159
And that's the self-promotion double bind.

00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.002
The self-promotion double bind

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:58.181
is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments,

00:10:58.205 --> 00:10:59.415
no one notices.

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.843
And if we do, we're not likable.

00:11:01.867 --> 00:11:05.433
But if we ask for advice
about one of our accomplishments,

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:09.767
we are able to be competent
in their eyes but also be likeable.

00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:12.502
And this is so powerful

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:15.074
it even works when you see it coming.

00:11:15.469 --> 00:11:19.509
There have been multiple times in life
when I have been forewarned

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:23.971
that a low-power person has been given
the advice to come ask me for advice.

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:26.531
I want you to notice
three things about this:

00:11:26.555 --> 00:11:29.543
First, I knew they were going
to come ask me for advice.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.932
Two, I've actually done research
on the strategic benefits

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:35.257
of asking for advice.

00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:38.208
And three, it still worked!

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.873
I took their perspective,

00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:42.084
I became more invested in their cause,

00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:45.914
I became more committed to them
because they asked for advice.

00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:49.527
Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:51.690
is when we have expertise.

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:54.299
Expertise gives us credibility.

00:11:54.862 --> 00:11:57.789
When we have high power,
we already have credibility.

00:11:57.813 --> 00:11:59.278
We only need good evidence.

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:02.747
When we lack power,
we don't have the credibility.

00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:05.033
We need excellent evidence.

00:12:05.394 --> 00:12:09.141
And one of the ways
we can come across as an expert

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:11.263
is by tapping into our passion.

00:12:11.784 --> 00:12:15.958
I want everyone in the next few days
to go up to friend of theirs

00:12:15.982 --> 00:12:17.227
and just say to them,

00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:19.961
"I want you to describe
a passion of yours to me."

00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:23.223
I've had people do this all over the world

00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:24.503
and I asked them,

00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:26.696
"What did you notice
about the other person

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.774
when they described their passion?"

00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:30.698
And the answers are always the same.

00:12:30.722 --> 00:12:32.730
"Their eyes lit up and got big."

00:12:32.754 --> 00:12:35.703
"They smiled a big beaming smile."

00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:37.371
"They used their hands all over --

00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:39.877
I had to duck because their
hands were coming at me."

00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.112
"They talk quickly
with a little higher pitch."

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.110
(Laughter)

00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:45.578
"They leaned in
as if telling me a secret."

00:12:45.602 --> 00:12:46.923
And then I said to them,

00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:50.021
"What happened to you
as you listened to their passion?"

00:12:50.374 --> 00:12:52.654
They said, "My eyes lit up.

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:53.948
I smiled.

00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:55.345
I leaned in."

00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:57.438
When we tap into our passion,

00:12:57.462 --> 00:13:00.828
we give ourselves the courage,
in our own eyes, to speak up,

00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:03.720
but we also get the permission
from others to speak up.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:09.824
Tapping into our passion even works
when we come across as too weak.

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:15.007
Both men and women get punished
at work when they shed tears.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:21.762
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when
we frame our strong emotions as passion,

00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:27.872
the condemnation of our crying
disappears for both men and women.

00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:32.066
I want to end with a few words
from my late father

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.251
that he spoke at my twin
brother's wedding.

00:13:34.675 --> 00:13:36.260
Here's a picture of us.

00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:39.921
My dad was a psychologist like me,

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:43.667
but his real love and his real
passion was cinema,

00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:44.891
like my brother.

00:13:44.915 --> 00:13:47.481
And so he wrote a speech
for my brother's wedding

00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.654
about the roles we play
in the human comedy.

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:52.967
And he said, "The lighter your touch,

00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.843
the better you become at improving
and enriching your performance.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.256
Those who embrace their roles
and work to improve their performance

00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:04.620
grow, change and expand the self.

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:06.375
Play it well,

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.372
and your days will be mostly joyful."

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:10.571
What my dad was saying

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:14.381
is that we've all been assigned
ranges and roles in this world.

00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:18.513
But he was also saying
the essence of this talk:

00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:24.022
those roles and ranges are constantly
expanding and evolving.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.532
So when a scene calls for it,

00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:28.730
be a ferocious mama bear

00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:30.893
and a humble advice seeker.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:35.515
Have excellent evidence and strong allies.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.248
Be a passionate perspective taker.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.490
And if you use those tools --

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:44.080
and each and every one of you
can use these tools --

00:14:44.104 --> 00:14:47.970
you will expand your range
of acceptable behavior,

00:14:47.994 --> 00:14:50.952
and your days will be mostly joyful.

00:14:52.082 --> 00:14:53.232
Thank you.

00:14:53.256 --> 00:14:55.687
(Applause)
