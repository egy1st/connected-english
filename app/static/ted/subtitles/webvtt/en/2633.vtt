WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.452
It's easy to forget that last night,

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.682
one billion people went to sleep
without access to electricity.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:09.424
One billion people.

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:15.037
Two and a half billion people
did not have access to clean cooking fuels

00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:16.885
or clean heating fuels.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.596
Those are the problems
in the developing world.

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:23.618
And it's easy for us not to be empathetic

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.955
with those people
who seem so distanced from us.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:29.106
But even in our own world,
the developed world,

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.630
we see the tension of stagnant economies

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:35.849
impacting the lives of people around us.

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.345
We see it in whole pieces of the economy,

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:42.912
where the people involved
have lost hope about the future

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.942
and despair about the present.

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:47.005
We see that in the Brexit vote.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:50.985
We see that in the Sanders/Trump
campaigns in my own country.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:56.195
But even in countries as recently
turning the corner

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.439
towards being in the developed world,

00:00:58.463 --> 00:00:59.703
in China,

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.303
we see the difficulty
that President Xi has

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.666
as he begins to un-employ so many people
in his coal and mining industries

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.145
who see no future for themselves.

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.186
As we as a society
figure out how to manage

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.163
the problems of the developed world

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:18.235
and the problems of the developing world,

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.107
we have to look at how we move forward

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.841
and manage the environmental impact
of those decisions.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:28.967
We've been working on this problem
for 25 years, since Rio,

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:30.674
the Kyoto Protocols.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.797
Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:37.088
and the resulting climate agreements

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.021
that are being ratified
by nations around the world.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:42.232
I think we can be very hopeful

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:45.394
that those agreements,
which are bottom-up agreements,

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:48.279
where nations have said
what they think they can do,

00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:52.381
are genuine and forthcoming
for the vast majority of the parties.

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:54.545
The unfortunate thing

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.732
is that now, as we look
at the independent analyses

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.955
of what those climate treaties
are liable to yield,

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:05.992
the magnitude of the problem
before us becomes clear.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:11.038
This is the United States
Energy Information Agency's assessment

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:16.313
of what will happen if the countries
implement the climate commitments

00:02:16.337 --> 00:02:18.373
that they've made in Paris

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:20.348
between now and 2040.

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:25.441
It shows basically CO2 emissions
around the world

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:27.146
over the next 30 years.

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:31.752
There are three things that you need
to look at and appreciate.

00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:36.348
One, CO2 emissions are expected
to continue to grow

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:37.831
for the next 30 years.

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:41.531
In order to control climate,

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:45.040
CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:49.718
because it's the cumulative emissions
that drive heating on the planet.

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:54.560
This should tell you that we are losing
the race to fossil fuels.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:57.430
The second thing you should notice

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:01.747
is that the bulk of the growth
comes from the developing countries,

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:04.836
from China, from India,
from the rest of the world,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.099
which includes South Africa
and Indonesia and Brazil,

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:11.853
as most of these countries
move their people

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:15.264
into the lower range of lifestyles

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:19.054
that we literally take for granted
in the developed world.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:22.878
The final thing that you should notice

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.561
is that each year,

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:32.354
about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting
added to the planet's atmosphere,

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:35.626
and then diffusing into the ocean
and into the land.

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:41.321
That's on top of the 550 gigatons
that are in place today.

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:43.896
At the end of 30 years,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.473
we will have put 850 gigatons
of carbon into the air,

00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:51.422
and that probably goes a long way

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:57.607
towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase
in global mean surface temperatures,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.826
locking in ocean acidification

00:04:01.227 --> 00:04:03.204
and locking in sea level rise.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.205
Now, this is a projection made by men

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:10.125
by the actions of society,

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:13.339
and it's ours to change, not to accept.

00:04:13.912 --> 00:04:17.790
But the magnitude of the problem
is something we need to appreciate.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:21.091
Different nations make
different energy choices.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.442
It's a function
of their natural resources.

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.475
It's a function of their climate.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.981
It's a function of the development path
that they've followed as a society.

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:34.167
It's a function of where
on the surface of the planet they are.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.691
Are they where it's dark
a lot of the time,

00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:38.576
or are they at the mid-latitudes?

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:42.708
Many, many, many things
go into the choices of countries,

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:45.362
and they each make a different choice.

00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:50.040
The overwhelming thing
that we need to appreciate

00:04:50.064 --> 00:04:51.981
is the choice that China has made.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:55.289
China has made the choice,

00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:57.818
and will make the choice, to run on coal.

00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:00.377
The United States has an alternative.

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:02.158
It can run on natural gas

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:06.007
as a result of the inventions
of fracking and shale gas,

00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:07.502
which we have here.

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:09.091
They provide an alternative.

00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:13.373
The OECD Europe has a choice.

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:16.950
It has renewables that it can afford
to deploy in Germany

00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:19.591
because it's rich enough
to afford to do it.

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:25.103
The French and the British
show interest in nuclear power.

00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:30.307
Eastern Europe, still very heavily
committed to natural gas and to coal,

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.059
and with natural gas
that comes from Russia,

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.853
with all of its entanglements.

00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:38.015
China has many fewer choices

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.289
and a much harder row to hoe.

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:44.589
If you look at China, and you ask yourself

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:46.817
why has coal been important to it,

00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.053
you have to remember what China's done.

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:52.841
China brought people to power,
not power to people.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.830
It didn't do rural electrification.

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:57.601
It urbanized.

00:05:57.954 --> 00:06:02.158
It urbanized by taking low-cost labor
and low-cost energy,

00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:04.099
creating export industries

00:06:04.123 --> 00:06:06.630
that could fund a tremendous
amount of growth.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.739
If we look at China's path,

00:06:09.763 --> 00:06:13.896
all of us know that prosperity in China
has dramatically increased.

00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:19.259
In 1980, 80 percent of China's population

00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:21.717
lived below the extreme poverty level,

00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:26.253
below the level of having
$1.90 per person per day.

00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:32.130
By the year 2000, only 20 percent
of China's population

00:06:32.154 --> 00:06:34.688
lived below the extreme poverty level --

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:37.192
a remarkable feat,

00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:40.344
admittedly, with some costs
in civil liberties

00:06:40.368 --> 00:06:43.324
that would be tough to accept
in the Western world.

00:06:44.548 --> 00:06:47.455
But the impact of all that wealth

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.992
allowed people to get
massively better nutrition.

00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:54.199
It allowed water pipes to be placed.

00:06:54.223 --> 00:06:56.682
It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:59.678
dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.213
at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.350
But in 1980, and even today,

00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:10.381
the number one killer in China
is indoor air pollution,

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:15.602
because people do not have access
to clean cooking and heating fuels.

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:18.174
In fact, in 2040,

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:24.569
it's still estimated
that 200 million people in China

00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:28.144
will not have access
to clean cooking fuels.

00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:31.489
They have a remarkable path to follow.

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:37.602
India also needs to meet the needs
of its own people,

00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:39.800
and it's going to do that by burning coal.

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:45.953
When we look at the EIA's projections
of coal burning in India,

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:51.494
India will supply nearly four times
as much of its energy from coal

00:07:51.518 --> 00:07:53.557
as it will from renewables.

00:07:54.962 --> 00:07:57.815
It's not because they don't know
the alternatives;

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:01.584
it's because rich countries
can do what they choose,

00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:04.309
poor countries do what they must.

00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:09.883
So what can we do to stop
coal's emissions in time?

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:15.511
What can we do that changes
this forecast that's in front of us?

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:19.602
Because it's a forecast that we can change
if we have the will to do it.

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:24.513
First of all, we have to think
about the magnitude of the problem.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.581
Between now and 2040,

00:08:27.104 --> 00:08:32.847
800 to 1,600 new coal plants
are going to be built around the world.

00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:38.694
This week, between one and three
one-gigawatt coal plants

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.929
are being turned on around the world.

00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:45.867
That's happening regardless
of what we want,

00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:48.399
because the people
that rule their countries,

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.793
assessing the interests of their citizens,

00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:54.232
have decided it's in the interest
of their citizens to do that.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:59.302
And that's going to happen
unless they have a better alternative.

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:03.483
And every 100 of those plants will use up

00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:06.638
between one percent and three percent

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:08.280
of the Earth's climate budget.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:12.755
So every day that you go home
thinking that you should do something

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.055
about global warming,

00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:16.526
at the end of that week, remember:

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.943
somebody fired up a coal plant
that's going to run for 50 years

00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:24.043
and take away your ability to change it.

00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:29.566
What we've forgotten is something
that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.712
a man of Indian ethnicity
but an American venture capitalist.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:36.164
And he said, back in the early 2000s,

00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:40.195
that if you needed to get
China and India off of fossil fuels,

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:43.815
you had to create a technology
that passed the "Chindia test,"

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.099
"Chindia" being the appending
of the two words.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.259
It had to be first of all viable,

00:09:50.283 --> 00:09:53.877
meaning that technically, they could
implement it in their country,

00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:56.905
and that it would be accepted
by the people in the country.

00:09:58.191 --> 00:10:04.764
Two, it had to be a technology
that was scalable,

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:07.806
that it could deliver the same benefits

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.907
on the same timetable as fossil fuels,

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:15.179
so that they can enjoy the kind of life,
again, that we take for granted.

00:10:15.766 --> 00:10:18.275
And third, it had to be cost-effective

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:20.985
without subsidy or without mandate.

00:10:21.432 --> 00:10:24.146
It had to stand on its own two feet;

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.049
it could not be maintained
for that many people

00:10:28.073 --> 00:10:30.529
if in fact, those countries
had to go begging

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:34.828
or had some foreign country say,
"I won't trade with you,"

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:38.611
in order to get
the technology shift to occur.

00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:41.854
If you look at the Chindia test,

00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:46.503
we simply have not come up
with alternatives that meet that test.

00:10:46.984 --> 00:10:49.828
That's what the EIA forecast tells us.

00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:54.115
China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:57.050
400 gigawatts of hydro,

00:10:57.772 --> 00:11:00.144
about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,

00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:04.562
and on an energy-equivalent basis,
adjusting for intermittency,

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.877
about 100 gigawatts of renewables.

00:11:07.554 --> 00:11:09.462
800 gigawatts of coal.

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:13.357
They're doing that, knowing the costs
better than any other country,

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.933
knowing the need better
than any other country.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:19.081
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040

00:11:19.105 --> 00:11:21.429
unless we give them a better choice.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.639
To give them a better choice,

00:11:23.663 --> 00:11:26.224
it's going to have to meet
the Chindia test.

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.906
If you look at all the alternatives
that are out there,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.430
there are really two
that come near to meeting it.

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.750
First is this area of new nuclear
that I'll talk about in just a second.

00:11:36.107 --> 00:11:39.407
It's a new generation of nuclear plants
that are on the drawing boards

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:40.707
around the world,

00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:43.069
and the people who are
developing these say

00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:46.634
we can get them
in position to demo by 2025

00:11:47.252 --> 00:11:50.525
and to scale by 2030,
if you will just let us.

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:54.080
The second alternative
that could be there in time

00:11:54.771 --> 00:11:58.476
is utility-scale solar
backed up with natural gas,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.224
which we can use today,

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:03.182
versus the batteries
which are still under development.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:06.924
So what's holding new nuclear back?

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.361
Outdated regulations
and yesterday's mindsets.

00:12:11.972 --> 00:12:16.167
We have not used our latest
scientific thinking on radiological health

00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:18.879
to think how we communicate
with the public

00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:21.281
and govern the testing
of new nuclear reactors.

00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:25.926
We have new scientific knowledge
that we need to use

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.489
in order to improve the way
we regulate nuclear industry.

00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:33.321
The second thing is we've got a mindset

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.154
that it takes 25 years
and 2 to 5 billion dollars

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:37.913
to develop a nuclear power plant.

00:12:37.937 --> 00:12:41.866
That comes from the historical,
military mindset

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:44.851
of the places nuclear power came from.

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:47.567
These new nuclear ventures are saying

00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.496
that they can deliver power
for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:53.813
they can deliver it
for 100 gigawatts a year;

00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:56.772
they can demo it by 2025;

00:12:57.168 --> 00:13:00.173
and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:02.833
if only we give them a chance.

00:13:04.064 --> 00:13:06.967
Right now, we're basically
waiting for a miracle.

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.472
What we need is a choice.

00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:12.756
If they can't make it safe,
if they can't make it cheap,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.597
it should not be deployed.

00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:18.675
But what I want you to do
is not carry an idea forward,

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.350
but write your leaders,

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.752
write the head of the NGOs you support,

00:13:22.776 --> 00:13:25.719
and tell them to give you the choice,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.441
not the past.

00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:28.649
Thank you very much.

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:33.465
(Applause)
