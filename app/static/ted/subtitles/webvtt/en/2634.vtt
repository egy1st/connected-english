Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter
important for the US right now

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
and in the world?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.840
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter
is our call to action.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.696
It is a tool to reimagine a world

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.936
where black people are free to exist,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.896
free to live.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520
It is a tool for our allies
to show up differently for us.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.360
I grew up in a neighborhood
that was heavily policed.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.176
I witnessed my brothers and my siblings

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.936
continuously stopped and frisked
by law enforcement.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.496
I remember my home being raided.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.416
And one of my questions
as a child was, why?

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.640
Why us?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.920
Black Lives Matter
offers answers to the why.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.376
It offers a new vision
for young black girls around the world

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.336
that we deserve to be fought for,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.840
that we deserve to call
on local governments to show up for us.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.096
Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism --

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.336
(Applause)

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.376
And antiblack racism is not only
happening in the United States.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.136
It's actually happening
all across the globe.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.296
And what we need now more than ever
is a human rights movement

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.176
that challenges systemic racism
in every single context.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800
(Applause)

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.776
We need this because the global reality

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.216
is that black people
are subject to all sorts of disparities

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.016
in most of our most challenging
issues of our day.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.816
I think about issues like climate change,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.336
and how six of the 10 worst impacted
nations by climate change

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.720
are actually on the continent of Africa.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.776
People are reeling
from all sorts of unnatural disasters,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.616
displacing them
from their ancestral homes

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000
and leaving them without a chance
at making a decent living.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.896
We also see disasters
like Hurricane Matthew,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.456
which recently wreaked havoc
in many different nations,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.080
but caused the most damage to Haiti.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.016
Haiti is the poorest country
in this hemisphere,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.760
and its inhabitants are black people.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.736
And what we're seeing in Haiti

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.936
is that they were actually facing
a number of challenges

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.656
that even preceded this hurricane.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.536
They were reeling from the earthquake,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.736
they were reeling from cholera
that was brought in by UN peacekeepers

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.920
and still hasn't been eradicated.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.696
This is unconscionable.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.616
And this would not happen if this nation
didn't have a population that was black,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.016
and we have to be real about that.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.216
But what's most heartening right now

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.416
is that despite these challenges,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.416
what we're seeing is
that there's a network of Africans

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.056
all across the continent

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.256
who are rising up and fighting back
and demanding climate justice.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.360
(Applause)

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.056
MB: So Alicia,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.856
you've said that when
black people are free,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.816
everyone is free.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.536
Can you talk about what that means?

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.776
Alicia Garza: Sure.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.736
So I think race and racism
is probably the most studied

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.656
social, economic and political
phenomenon in this country,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.816
but it's also the least understood.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.616
The reality is that race
in the United States

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.576
operates on a spectrum
from black to white.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.976
Doesn't mean that people who are
in between don't experience racism,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.856
but it means that the closer
you are to white on that spectrum,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.176
the better off you are.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.176
And the closer to black
that you are on that spectrum

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.016
the worse off your are.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.856
When we think about
how we address problems in this country,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.616
we often start from a place
of trickle-down justice.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.456
So using white folks
as the control we say,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.623
well, if we make things
better for white folks

00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:06.727
then everybody else is going to get free.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.296
But actually it doesn't work that way.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.976
We have to address problems at the root,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.136
and when you deal with what's
happening in black communities,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.495
it creates an effervescence, right?

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.336
So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.096
Let me give an example.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.696
When we talk about the wage gap,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.216
we often say women make 78 cents
to every dollar that a man makes.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.096
You all have heard that before.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.336
But those are the statistics
for white women and white men.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.456
The reality is that black women
make something like 64 cents

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.400
to every 78 cents that white women make.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.016
When we talk about latinas,
it goes down to about 58 cents.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.136
If we were to talk about indigenous women,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.976
if we were to talk about trans women,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.896
it would even go further down.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.136
So again,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.536
if you deal with those
who are the most impacted,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.816
everybody has an opportunity
to benefit from that,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.856
rather than dealing with the folks
who are not as impacted,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.096
and expecting it to trickle down.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.696
MB: So I love the effervescence,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.936
bubbling up.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.696
AG: Effervescence -- like champagne.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.936
(Laughter)

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.296
MB: Who doesn't love
a glass of champagne, right?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.736
Champagne and freedom, right?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.016
(Laughter)

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.600
What more could we want, y'all?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.256
So you all have been
doing this for a minute,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.656
and the last few years have been --

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.016
well, I can't even imagine,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.416
but I'm sure very transformative.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.456
And I know that you all
have learned a lot about leadership.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.536
What do you want
to share with these people

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.616
about what you've learned
about leadership?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.136
Patrisse, let's start with you.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.736
PC: Yeah, we have to invest
in black leadership.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.416
That's what I've learned the most
in the last few years.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.776
(Applause)

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.776
What we've seen is thousands
of black people showing up for our lives

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.840
with very little infrastructure
and very little support.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.696
I think our work as movement leaders
isn't just about our own visibility

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.336
but rather how do we
make the whole visible.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.456
How do we not just fight
for our individual selves

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.296
but fight for everybody?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.656
And I also think

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.800
leadership looks like
everybody in this audience

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.776
showing up for black lives.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.016
It's not just about coming
and watching people on a stage, right?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.040
It's about how do you
become that leader --

00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:34.176
whether it's in your workplace,
whether it's in your home --

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.256
and believe that the movement
for black lives isn't just for us,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.680
but it's for everybody.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.976
(Applause)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.616
MB: What about you, Opal?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.416
OT: So I've been learning
a great deal about interdependence.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.376
I've been learning
about how to trust your team.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.016
I've come up with this new mantra

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.776
after coming back
from a three-month sabbatical,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.456
which is rare for black women to take
who are in leadership,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.856
but I felt it was really important
for my leadership and for my team

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.496
to also practice stepping back

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.600
as well as also sometimes stepping in.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.336
And what I learned in this process
was that we need to acknowledge

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.056
that different people
contribute different strengths,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.576
and that in order
for our entire team to flourish,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.736
we have to allow them
to share and allow them to shine.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.456
And so during my sabbatical

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.056
with the organization
that I also work with,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.296
I saw our team rise up in my absence.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.776
They were able to launch new programs,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.216
fundraise.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.936
And when I came back,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.016
I had to give them
a lot of gratitude and praise

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.776
because they showed me
that they truly had my back

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.696
and that they truly had their own backs.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.336
You know, in this process
of my sabbatical,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.616
I was really reminded

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.576
of this Southern African
philosophy of Ubuntu.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.000
I am because you are;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.440
you are because I am.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.536
And I realized that my own leadership,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.096
and the contributions
that I'm able to make,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.376
is in large part due to the contributions
that they make, right?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.016
And I have to acknowledge that,
and I have to see that,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.320
and so my new mantra is,
"Keep calm and trust the team."

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.616
And also,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.056
"Keep calm and thank the team."

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.656
MB: You know, one of the things
I feel like I've heard

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.456
in the context of the Black Lives Matter
movement more than anywhere else

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.696
is about being a leaderful movement,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.456
and that's such a beautiful concept,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.736
and I think that something

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.576
that women often bring
to the conversation about leadership

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.096
is really the collective piece.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.360
What about you, Alicia?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.520
AG: Yeah ...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.080
How many of you heard that saying
that leadership is lonely?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.296
I think that there is an element
where leadership is lonely,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.536
but I also believe
that it doesn't have to be like that.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.016
And in order for us to get to that point,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.776
I think there's a few things
that we need to be doing.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.640
So one is we have to stop
treating leaders like superheroes.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.576
We are ordinary people
attempting to do extraordinary things,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.040
and so we need to be
supported in that way.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.416
The other thing that
I've learned about leadership

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.616
is that there's a difference
between leadership and celebrities, right?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.976
And there's a way in which we've been
kind of transformed into celebrities

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.960
rather than people
who are trying to solve a problem.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.776
And the way that we treat
celebrities is very fickle, right?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.056
We like them one day,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.336
we don't like what they're
wearing the next day,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.656
and all of a sudden we have issues, right?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.056
So we need to stop deifying leaders

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.696
so that more people
will step into leadership.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.336
Lots of people are terrified
to step into leadership

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.056
because of how much scrutiny they receive

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.560
and how brutal we are with leaders.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.936
And then the last thing
that I've learned about leadership

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.040
is that it's really easy to be a leader
when everybody likes you.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.360
But it's hard to be a leader
when you have to make hard choices

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.816
and when you have to do what's right,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.736
even though people
are not going to like you for it.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.016
And so in that way,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.376
I think another way
that we can support leaders

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.096
is to struggle with us,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.736
but struggle with us politically,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.496
not personally.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.416
We can have disagreements
without being disagreeable,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.616
but it's important for us
to sharpen each other,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.256
so that we all can rise.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.839
MB: That's beautiful, thank you.

00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:37.173
(Applause)

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.576
So you all are doing work

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.296
that forces you to face
some brutal, painful realities

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.520
on a daily basis.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.776
What gives you hope

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.080
and inspires you in that context?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.296
PC: I am hopeful for black futures.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.536
And I say that because
we live in a society

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.216
that's so obsessed with black death.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.816
We have images of our death
on the TV screen,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.736
on our Twitter timelines,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.296
on our Facebook timelines,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.720
but what if instead
we imagine black life?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.696
We imagine black people
living and thriving.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.176
And that --

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.480
that inspires me.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.080
OT: What inspires me
these days are immigrants.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.256
Immigrants all over the world
who are doing the best that they can

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.736
to make a living,
to survive and also to thrive.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.016
Right now there are
over 244 million people

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.320
who aren't living
in their country of origin.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.800
This is a 40 percent increase
since the year 2000.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.096
So what this tells me

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.800
is that the disparities across the globe
are only getting worse.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.616
Yet there are people who are finding
the strength and wherewithal to travel,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.856
to move,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.176
to eke out a better living for themselves

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.880
and to provide for their families
and their loved ones.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.976
And some of these people
who are immigrants

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.976
are also undocumented.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.696
They're unauthorized.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.856
And they inspire me even more

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.616
because although our society
is telling them, you're not wanted,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.016
you're not needed here,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.416
and they're highly vulnerable
and subject to abuse, to wage theft,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.696
to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.896
many of them are also beginning
to organize in their communities.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.096
And what I'm seeing is
that there's also an emerging network

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.416
of black, undocumented people
who are resisting the framework,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.376
and resisting the criminalization
of their existence.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.976
And that to me is incredibly powerful

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and inspires me every singe day.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.520
MB: Thank you.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.880
Alicia?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.136
AG: So we know that young people
are the present and the future,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.576
but what inspires me are older people

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.800
who are becoming transformed
in the service of this movement.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.976
We all know that as you get older,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.176
you get a little more
entrenched in your ways.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.976
It's happening to me, I know that's right.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.776
But I'm so inspired when I see people
who have a way that they do things,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.856
have a way that they
think about the world,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.296
and they're courageous enough to be open
to listening to what the experiences are

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.736
of so many of us who want
to live in world that's just

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.336
and want to live
in a world that's equitable.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.016
And I'm also inspired by the actions
that I'm seeing older people taking

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.576
in service of this movement.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.456
I'm inspired by seeing older people
step into their own power and leadership

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.256
and say, "I'm not passing a torch,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.960
I'm helping you light the fire."

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.456
(Applause)

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.696
MB: I love that --

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.096
yes.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.336
So in terms of action,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.776
I think that it is awesome to sit here
and be able to listen to you all,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.056
and to have our minds open and shift,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.056
but that's not going to get
black people free.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.536
So if you had one thing
you would like this audience

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.256
and the folks who are watching
around the world to actually do,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.480
what would that be?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.096
AG: OK, two quick ones.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.016
One, call the White House.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.296
The water protectors
are being forcibly removed

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.896
from the camp that they have set up
to defend what keeps us alive.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.776
And that is intricately
related to black lives.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.856
So definitely call the White House
and demand that they stop doing that.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.096
There are tanks

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.200
and police officers arresting
every single person there as we speak.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.856
(Applause)

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.976
The second thing that you can do

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.720
is to join something.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.696
Be a part of something.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.216
There are groups, collectives --

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.816
doesn't have to be a non-profit,
you know what I mean?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.416
But there are groups that are doing
work in our communities right now

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.456
to make sure that black lives matter
so all lives matter.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.696
Get involved;

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.296
don't sit on your couch and tell people
what you think they should be doing.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.520
Go do it with us.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.296
MB: Do you guys want to add anything?

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.176
That's good? All right. So --

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.296
And I think that the joining something,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.536
like if you feel like there's
not something where you are, start it.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.776
AG: Start it.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.856
MB: These conversations that we're having,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.976
have those conversations
with somebody else.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.816
And then instead of just
letting it be a talk that you had,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.536
actually decide to start something.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.816
OT: That's right.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.555
MB: I mean, that's what you all did.

00:15:42.579 --> 00:15:44.835
You started something,
and look what's happened.

00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:47.776
Thank you all so much
for being here with us today.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.016
OT: Thank you.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.366
(Applause)
