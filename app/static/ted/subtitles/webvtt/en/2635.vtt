00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:03.259
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation
was on Facebook,

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.233
and it was three days long.

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.681
(Laughter)

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:09.837
We shared over 3,000 messages between us,

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:13.516
and it was during those 72 hours
that I knew she was going to be my wife.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:17.234
We didn't wait any prerequisite
amount of time for our courtship;

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:19.613
we told each other
the vulnerable truths up front:

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.881
I am a transgender man,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.315
which means the F on my birth
certificate should have stood for "False,"

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.519
instead of "Female."

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:27.878
(Laughter)

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.786
Walking around as a woman in the world

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.132
felt like walking with
pebbles in my shoes.

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:34.247
It took the rhythm out of my swagger,

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.531
it threw me off balance,

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:37.664
it pained me with every step
I took forward.

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:40.292
But today I'm a man of my own intention;

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:41.838
a man of my own design.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.006
Kim Katrin Milan: I am
a cisgender queer woman.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.798
Cisgender means the gender
I was assigned at birth

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:50.094
is still and has always been female.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.055
This doesn't make me natural or normal,

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.015
this is just one way of describing
the many different ways

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.710
that we exist in this world.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:00:59.984
And queer is a cultural term,

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.205
but in this case,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.852
it refers to the way that I'm not
restricted by gender

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:05.581
when it comes to choosing partners.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.636
I've identified in a few different ways --

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.270
as a bisexual, as a lesbian --

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:10.371
but for me,

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:15.244
queerness encompasses all of the layers
of who I am and how I've loved.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.534
I'm layers, and not fractions.

00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:19.349
And for me,

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:20.706
the fact that he was queer

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.112
meant that I could trust his courtship
from the very beginning.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.774
As queer and trans people,

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:29.745
we're so often excluded
from institutions and traditions.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.743
We create spaces outside of convention,

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.879
including the conventions of time.

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:37.956
And in those 3,000 messages between us,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.218
we collapsed time;

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:40.401
we queered it;

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:42.187
we laid it all on the table.

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:43.247
(Laughter)

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.033
With no pretense at all.

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.312
And this meant that we were able
to commit to each other

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:49.933
in a profoundly different way.

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:54.564
So often what we're told is this idea
of the "Golden Rule,"

00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:58.029
that we should treat other people
the way we want to be treated.

00:01:58.053 --> 00:01:59.409
But the problem with that

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.664
is that it assumes that we are
the standard for other people,

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:03.908
and we're not.

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:07.422
We need to treat other people
the way they want to be treated,

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:09.215
which means we had to ask.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.902
I couldn't assume that the kind
of love that Tiq needed

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:13.888
was the same kind of love that I needed.

00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:18.080
So I asked him everything --
about his fears, his insecurities --

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.500
and we started from there.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.172
TM: I didn't know what
kind of love I needed.

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:24.396
I had just come out of a year-long fog

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.542
of being rejected and utterly depleted.

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:28.811
I had someone look me in my eyes

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:32.274
and tell me that I was unworthy
of their love because I was trans.

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.596
And there's a culture of lovelessness

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.752
that we've created around
transgender people.

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:39.728
It's reasoned, justified
and often signed into law.

00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:42.767
And I was a heartbeat away
from internalizing that message,

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:44.333
that I wasn't worthy.

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.125
But Kim said that I was her ideal --

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.754
the heartbroken mess that I was.

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:48.928
(Laughter)

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.006
KKM: He totally was my ideal.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.142
(Laughter)

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.490
In more ways than one.

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.246
Both poets, writers, creatives

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.751
with a long history
of community work behind us,

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.573
and big, huge dreams
of a family in front of us,

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:03.714
we shared a lot of things in common,

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:05.582
but we were also incredibly different.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:08.178
I've been a lifelong traveler
and a bit of an orphan,

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:10.344
whereas he comes from a huge family,

00:03:10.368 --> 00:03:12.205
and definitely stays grounded.

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:15.284
I often kind of sum up
the differences in our strengths

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:16.866
by saying, "Keep me safe,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.330
and I'll keep you wild."

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:19.795
(Laughter)

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:26.652
TM: We have marginalized identities
but we don't live marginalized lives.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.504
Being queer and trans is about creating
new ways of existing.

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:32.697
It's about loving people as they are,

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.573
not as they're supposed to be.

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:36.574
Kim is unapologetically feminine

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:39.416
in a world that is often cruel and violent

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.723
to women who are
too proud and too freeing.

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:43.368
And I didn't enter into this union

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:46.897
under the auspices that she
was going to be my helper or my rib,

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:48.663
but a fully complex --

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:49.702
(Laughter)

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:52.020
KKM: Right? That's not right.

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.740
TM: But a fully complex human being

00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:57.373
whose femininity wasn't for me
to rein in, control or critique.

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:58.919
It's her brilliance,

00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:00.587
the way she leads with compassion,

00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.756
and how she never loses
sight of her empathy.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.849
She has been my hero since day one.

00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:08.488
(Applause)

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:13.303
KKM: Our relationship has always been
about setting each other free.

00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:15.160
One of the first questions I asked him

00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:17.355
was what dreams he had left to accomplish,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.439
and how would I help him get there.

00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:21.407
His dreams to live as a poet,

00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.621
to adopt and raise a family together,

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:25.361
to live a life that he was proud of,

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:28.668
and one that would live up to
his mother's incredible legacy.

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:32.597
And I really appreciated that we
were able to start from that place,

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:35.527
and not from a place
that was around figuring out

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.696
how to make each other work together.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.293
And I think this really allowed us
to grow into the people that we were

00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:43.248
in a way that was incredibly different.

00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:45.358
I love him whole;

00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:47.805
pre-transition, now and in the future.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.621
And it's this love that had us
committed to each other

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.353
before we'd even seen each other's faces.

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:57.236
TM: My mother's biggest
concern when I transitioned

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.269
was who was going to love me as I am.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:05.731
Had being transgender somehow
precluded me from love and monogamy

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:08.680
because I was supposedly
born in the wrong body?

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:11.879
But it's this type of structuring
that has to be reframed

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:13.555
in order to let love in.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.472
My body never betrayed me,

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:17.184
and my body was never wrong.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:20.506
It's this restrictive,
binary thinking on gender

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.344
that said that I didn't exist.

00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:23.669
But when we met,

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:26.146
she loved me for exactly how I showed up.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.121
She would trace her fingers
along the numb keloid scars

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.881
left by my top surgery.

00:05:30.905 --> 00:05:34.921
Scars that run from the middle of my chest
all the way out to my outer torso.

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.695
She said that these were
reminders of my strength

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.400
and everything that I went through

00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:41.202
and nothing for me to be ashamed of.

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.234
So sprinting towards her hand in marriage

00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.184
was the queerest thing that I could do.

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:46.634
(Laughter)

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:50.767
It flew in the face of more
conventional trajectories

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.623
of love and relationships,

00:05:52.647 --> 00:05:55.793
because God was never supposed
to bless a union for folks like us,

00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:58.099
and the law was never
supposed to recognize it.

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:02.048
KKM: So on May 5, 2014,

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:05.153
just about three months
after meeting online,

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:09.757
we were married on the steps
of City Hall in Manhattan,

00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:13.438
and it was beautiful
in every conceivable way.

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:17.104
It's safe to say that we
reimagined some traditions,

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.942
but we also kept some old ones
that we worked in,

00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:22.077
and we created something
that worked for us.

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:27.401
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled
with wildflowers from Brooklyn --

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:31.534
also added in a little bit of lavender
and sage to keep us grounded

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.265
because we were so nervous.

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.819
And it was put together by a sweet
sister healer friend of ours.

00:06:36.843 --> 00:06:38.482
I never wanted a diamond ring,

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:40.974
because conflict and convention
are not my thing,

00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:42.803
so my ring is the deepest purple,

00:06:42.827 --> 00:06:44.471
like the color of my crown chakra,

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:46.635
and set in place with my birthstones.

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:49.101
The gift of queerness is options.

00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:51.261
I never had to choose his last name,

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.907
it was never an exception,

00:06:52.931 --> 00:06:56.260
but I did because I am
my father's bastard child,

00:06:56.284 --> 00:07:00.286
someone who has always been
an apology, a secret, an imposition.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.363
And it was incredibly freeing

00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:05.176
to choose the name of a man
who chose me first.

00:07:05.963 --> 00:07:08.149
(Applause)

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:15.975
TM: So we told some family
and some close friends,

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:19.197
many of whom were still in disbelief
as we took our vows.

00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:23.115
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding
photos on Facebook,

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.340
where we met --

00:07:24.364 --> 00:07:26.089
and Instagram, of course.

00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:28.174
And we quickly realized

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.396
that our coming together was more
than just a union of two people,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.402
but was a model of possibility
for the millions of LGBTQ folks

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:36.755
who have been sold this lie

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.708
that family and matrimony
is antithetical to who they are --

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.462
for those of us
who rarely get to see ourselves

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:44.087
reflected in love and happiness.

00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:45.589
KKM: And the thing is,

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.335
absolutely we are marginalized
because of our identities,

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:51.694
but it also emboldens us
to be the people that we are.

00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:53.949
Queerness is our major key;

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.875
blackness is our magic.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.495
It's because of these things

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:02.276
that we are able to be hopeful, open,
receptive and shape-shifting.

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:04.499
These are the things that give us,

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:07.135
and are such an incredible
source of, our strength.

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:09.427
Our queerness is a source
of that strength.

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:12.561
I think of the words of Ottawa-based
poet Brandon Wint:

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:17.166
"Not queer like gay;
queer like escaping definition.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.332
Queer like some sort of fluidity
and limitlessness all at once.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.698
Queer like a freedom
too strange to be conquered.

00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:27.989
Queer like the fearlessness
to imagine what love can look like,

00:08:28.013 --> 00:08:29.291
and to pursue it."

00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:32.393
TM: We are part of a community of folks --

00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:33.589
Yeah, that's good right?

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.191
(Laughter)

00:08:36.843 --> 00:08:40.633
We are part of a community of folks
who are living their authentic selves

00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:42.672
all along the gender spectrum,

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:45.200
despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:48.257
despite the undercurrent of anxiety
that always is present

00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:50.549
for people who live on their own terms.

00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:54.548
Globally, a transgender person
is murdered every 21 hours.

00:08:55.153 --> 00:09:01.752
And the United States has had more
trans murders on record this year

00:09:01.776 --> 00:09:03.193
than any year to date.

00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:07.282
However, our stories are much more
than this rigid dichotomy

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:08.758
of strength and resilience.

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:12.899
We are expanding the human
complexity on these margins,

00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:15.673
and we are creating freedom
on these margins.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.484
KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.

00:09:18.508 --> 00:09:22.362
We're creating a world
that we have literally never seen before;

00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:26.007
organizing families based
on love and not by blood,

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.983
guiding by a compassion that so few of us
have been shown ourselves.

00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:34.507
So many of us have not received
love from our families --

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.350
have been betrayed by the people
that we trust most.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.021
So what we do here is we create
entirely new languages of love.

00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:46.874
Ones that are about creating the space
for us to be our authentic selves

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:48.944
and not imposing this standard

00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:51.869
of what masculinity or femininity
is supposed to be.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:55.015
TM: We are interested
in love and inclusion

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:57.687
as a tool of revolutionary change, right?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.754
And the idea is simply,

00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:01.904
if we drop all our preconceived notions

00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:03.988
about how somebody is supposed to be --

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:07.187
in their body, in their
gender, in their skin --

00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:10.967
if we take the intentional steps
to unlearn these deep-seated biases

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:13.583
and create space for people
to be self-determined,

00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:14.935
and embrace who they are,

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:18.730
then we will definitely create a better
world than the one we were born into.

00:10:18.754 --> 00:10:20.372
(Applause)

00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:27.956
KKM: We want to mark this time in history

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.748
by leaving evidence of the fact
that we were here.

00:10:31.134 --> 00:10:34.132
We open up little windows
into our relationship

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:35.829
for our community to bear witness,

00:10:35.853 --> 00:10:38.880
and we do this because we want
to make maps to the future

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.886
and not monuments to ourselves.

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:45.253
Our experience does not invalidate
other peoples' experience,

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:48.857
but it should and necessarily does
complicate this idea

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:51.561
of what love and marriage
are supposed to be.

00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:54.667
TM: OK, now for all the talking,

00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:56.131
and inspiring,

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.887
and possibility-modeling we've done,

00:10:57.911 --> 00:10:59.636
we've been nowhere near perfect.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.937
And we've had to hold
a mirror up to ourselves.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.135
And I saw that I wasn't
always the best listener,

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:08.444
and that my ego got in the way
of our progress as a couple.

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:11.836
And I've had to really assess
these deep-seated, sexist ideas

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.161
that I've had about the value
of a woman's experience in the world.

00:11:15.185 --> 00:11:18.619
I've had to reevaluate what it means
to be in allyship with my wife.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.795
KKM: And I had to remind myself
of a lot of things, too.

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.803
What it means to be hard on the issues,

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:26.579
but soft on the person.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:30.035
While we were writing this,
we got into a massive fight.

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:32.236
(Laughter)

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:35.724
For so many different reasons,

00:11:35.748 --> 00:11:40.079
but based on the content about our values
and our lived experiences --

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:41.851
and we were really hurt, you know?

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:46.925
Because what we do and how we love
puts ourselves entirely on the line.

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:50.928
But even though the fight lasted
over the course of two days --

00:11:50.952 --> 00:11:52.241
(Laughter)

00:11:52.265 --> 00:11:55.084
We were able to come back
together to each other,

00:11:55.108 --> 00:11:59.261
and recommit to ourselves,
to each other and to our marriage.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:02.006
And that really yielded
some of the most passionate parts

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.944
of what we share with you here today.

00:12:04.444 --> 00:12:06.676
TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.480
which I think doesn't happen enough.

00:12:08.924 --> 00:12:10.713
I've had to interrogate masculinity;

00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:14.630
the toxic privileges that come
with being a man don't define me,

00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:17.970
but I have to be accountable
for how it shows up in my life every day.

00:12:18.484 --> 00:12:21.851
I have allowed my wife
to do all of the emotional labor

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:26.113
of prying open the lines of communication
when I'd rather clam up and run away.

00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:27.264
(Laughter)

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:31.537
I've stripped away emotional support
instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,

00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:34.976
particularly around the heartbreaking
miscarriage we suffered last year,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.363
and I'm sorry for that.

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:39.370
Sometimes as men,
we get to take the easy way out.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.197
And so my journey as a trans person
is about reimagining masculinity.

00:12:44.838 --> 00:12:47.353
About creating a manhood
that isn't measured

00:12:47.377 --> 00:12:50.921
by the power it wields,
by the entitlements afforded to it,

00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:53.450
or any simulacrum of control
that it can muster,

00:12:53.474 --> 00:12:55.292
but works in tandem with femininity,

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.986
and is guided by my spirit.

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:00.075
KKM: Y'all ...

00:13:00.099 --> 00:13:02.284
(Applause)

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:07.911
And this has created the space
for my femininity to flourish

00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:11.140
in a way I had never experienced before.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.692
He never is threatened by my sexuality,

00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:18.879
he never polices what I wear or how I act.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:22.890
I cook but he does way more
of the cleaning than I do.

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:25.106
And when we're rushing
to get out of the house

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.632
and we have so much to handle,

00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:28.249
he handles everything,

00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:30.460
so I have time to do my hair and makeup.

00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:31.634
(Laughter)

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.730
He understands that this is my armor,

00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:39.263
and he never treats femininity
as though it is frivolous or superficial,

00:13:39.287 --> 00:13:41.103
and this, and him --

00:13:41.127 --> 00:13:44.447
he grows my experience
of gender every single day.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.323
TM: I love to watch her
get dressed in the morning.

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.237
Watching her in the closet,

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:52.146
looking for something comfortable
and colorful, and tight,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.602
and safe --

00:13:53.626 --> 00:13:54.776
(Laughter)

00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:57.887
But it's challenging to watch her
negotiate her decisions

00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.399
looking for something that's going
to get the least amount of attention,

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:05.044
but at the same time be an expression
of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.

00:14:05.068 --> 00:14:07.806
And all I want to do is celebrate
her for her beauty,

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.727
and the things that make her
beautiful and special and free,

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:12.202
from her long acrylic nails,

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.246
to her uncompromising black feminism.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.936
(Applause)

00:14:19.315 --> 00:14:20.966
KKM: I love you. TM: I love you.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.140
(Laughter)

00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:25.032
KKM: There are so many queer
and trans people

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:26.449
who have come before us,

00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:29.168
whose stories we will never get to hear.

00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:32.823
We constantly experience
this retelling of history

00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:34.983
where we are conspicuously left out.

00:14:35.527 --> 00:14:38.372
And it's really hard
to not see ourselves there.

00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.370
And so living out loud for us
is about that representation.

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.117
It's about having possibility models,

00:14:45.141 --> 00:14:49.002
and having hope that love is part
of our inheritance in this world, too.

00:14:49.792 --> 00:14:51.798
TM: The possibility that we are practicing

00:14:51.822 --> 00:14:54.669
is about reinventing time,
love and institutions.

00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:57.332
We are creating a future of multiplicity.

00:14:57.724 --> 00:15:00.799
We are expanding the spectrum
of gender and sexuality,

00:15:00.823 --> 00:15:02.712
imagining ourselves into existence,

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:06.771
imagining a world where gender
is self-determined and not imposed,

00:15:06.795 --> 00:15:09.712
and where who we are
is a kaleidoscope of possibility

00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:14.115
without the narrow-minded limitations
masquerading as science or justice.

00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:16.915
(Applause)

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.185
KKM: And I can't lie:

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:23.265
it is really, really hard.

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:26.336
It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.725
with an open heart and a smile on my face.

00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:31.980
It is really hard to face the injustice
that exists in the world,

00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:36.034
while still believing in the ability
of people to really change.

00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:39.659
That takes an enormous amount
of faith and dedication.

00:15:40.058 --> 00:15:41.344
And beyond that,

00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:43.477
marriage is hard work.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:44.652
(Laughter)

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:47.244
Piles of dirty socks on the floor,

00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:51.029
more boring sports shows
than I ever thought possible --

00:15:51.053 --> 00:15:52.308
(Laughter)

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.487
And fights that bring me to tears

00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:57.376
when it feels like we're not
speaking the same language.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.519
But there is not a day that goes by

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.776
where I am not so grateful
to be married to this man;

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.626
where I'm not so grateful for
the possibility of changing minds,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.192
and rewarding conversations,

00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:11.196
and creating a world
where love belongs to us all.

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:13.115
I think about our acronym:

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.110
LGBTQ2SIA.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.798
A seemingly endless evolution
of self and a community,

00:16:22.822 --> 00:16:26.857
but also this really deep desire
not to leave anyone behind.

00:16:27.525 --> 00:16:29.387
We've learned how to love each other,

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:33.250
and we've committed to loving each other
throughout changes to gender

00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:34.842
and changes in spirit.

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:37.942
And we learned this love
in our chat rooms,

00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:41.646
in our clubs, in our bars
and in our community centers.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.404
We've learned how to love
each other for the long haul.

00:16:44.932 --> 00:16:46.104
TM &amp; KKM: Thank you.

00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:49.228
(Applause)
