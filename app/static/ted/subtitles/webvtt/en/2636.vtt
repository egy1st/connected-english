00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.150
This picture

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:04.349
is from my metro card

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:08.413
when I spent a year abroad in Paris
in college in the mid-'90s.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.970
My friend says I look
like a French anarchist --

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:13.001
(Laughter)

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:14.372
But this is still what I see

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.563
when I look in the mirror in the morning.

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:19.686
Within a month of living in Paris,
I'd lost 15 pounds

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.745
and I was in the best shape of my life

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.766
because I was eating fresh food

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.067
and I was walking wherever I went.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:28.639
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.068
a region built largely
by highways and automobiles

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.753
and with a reputation
as a poster child for sprawl,

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.339
Paris fundamentally changed
the way I understood

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.083
the construction of the world around me,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.936
and I got obsessed with the role
of infrastructure --

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.713
that it's not just the way to move people
from point A to point B,

00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:52.826
it's not just the way to convey water
or sewage or energy,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.420
but it's the foundation for our economy.

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:58.807
It's the foundation for our social life
and for our culture,

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.539
and it really matters
to the way that we live.

00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:04.702
When I came home,
I was instantly frustrated,

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:08.652
stuck in traffic as I crossed
the top end of our perimeter highway.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.943
Not only was I not moving a muscle,

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:12.612
I had no social interaction

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:15.875
with the hundreds of thousands of people
that were hurtling past me,

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.896
like me, with their eyes faced forward
and their music blaring.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:23.562
I wondered if this was
an inevitable outcome,

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:25.405
or could we do something about it.

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:29.045
Was it possible to transform
this condition in Atlanta

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.444
into the kind of place
that I wanted to live in?

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:35.045
I went back to grad school
in architecture and city planning,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.401
developed this interest in infrastructure,

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:40.018
and in 1999 came up with an idea

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.607
for my thesis project:

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.948
the adaptation of an obsolete loop
of old railroad circling downtown

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.012
as a new infrastructure
for urban revitalization.

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:50.442
It was just an idea.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.191
I never thought
we would actually build it.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.699
But I went to work
at an architecture firm,

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:59.246
and eventually talked
to my coworkers about it,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.038
and they loved the idea.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:03.448
And as we started talking
to more people about it,

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:05.500
more people wanted to hear about it.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.888
In the summer of 2001,

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.896
we connected with Cathy Woolard,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.051
who was soon elected
city council president.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:15.501
And we built a citywide vision
around this idea:

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:18.456
the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.334
of transit and trails and transformation.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:26.059
I was doing two and three meetings a week
for two and a half years,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.528
and so was Cathy and her staff
and a handful of volunteers.

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:33.851
Together, we built this amazing movement
of people and ideas.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.998
It included community advocates
who were used to fighting against things,

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:41.335
but found the Atlanta BeltLine
as something that they could fight for;

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.084
developers who saw the opportunity

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:46.043
to take advantage of a lot
of new growth in the city;

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:50.713
and dozens of nonprofit partners
who saw their mission

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.857
at least partly accomplished
by the shared vision.

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:59.118
Now, usually these groups of people
aren't at the same table

00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:00.710
wanting the same outcome.

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:04.469
But there we were,
and it was kind of weird,

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:07.353
but it was really, really powerful.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.770
The people of Atlanta
fell in love with a vision

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.098
that was better than what they saw
through their car windshields,

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.624
and the people of Atlanta made it happen,

00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:19.865
and I guarantee you we would not
be building it otherwise.

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:23.319
From the beginning,
our coalition was diverse.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:26.466
People of all stripes
were part of our story.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.306
People on the lower end
of the economic spectrum loved it, too.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.520
They were just afraid
they weren't going to be able to be there

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:35.713
when it got built,
that they'd be priced out.

00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:38.820
And we've all heard
that kind of story before, right?

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:42.914
But we promised that
the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.972
and people took ownership of the idea,

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.570
and they made it better
than anything we ever imagined

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.795
in the beginning,

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.079
including significant
subsidies for housing,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:56.912
new parks, art, an arboretum --
a list that continues to grow.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.102
And we put in place

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:01.749
the organizations and agencies
that were required to make it happen.

00:04:01.773 --> 00:04:04.102
And importantly, it is.

00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:07.894
Now we're in the early stages
of implementation, and it's working.

00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:12.711
The first mainline section
of trail was opened in 2012,

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:15.392
and it's already generated
over three billion dollars

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.102
of private-sector investment.

00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:21.500
But it's not only changing
the physical form of the city,

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:23.934
it's changing the way
we think about the city,

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.659
and what our expectations are
for living there.

00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:29.814
About a month ago,

00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:32.673
I had to take my kids with me
to the grocery store

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:34.369
and they were complaining about it,

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:36.441
because they didn't want
to get in the car.

00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:40.465
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.218
can we at least ride our bikes?"

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.548
And I said, "Of course we can.

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:46.607
That's what people in Atlanta do.

00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.050
We ride our bikes to the grocery store."

00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:50.307
(Laughter)

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.931
(Applause)

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:53.210
Thank you, yeah.

00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:55.965
Now, they don't know
how ridiculous that is,

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:57.660
but I do.

00:04:57.684 --> 00:05:01.693
And I also understand
that their expectations for Atlanta

00:05:01.717 --> 00:05:03.203
are really powerful.

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:06.996
This kind of transformation
is exactly like sprawl

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.623
in the last century,

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:12.067
the movement where our investment
in highways and automobiles

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:14.229
fundamentally changed American life.

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:17.096
That wasn't some grand conspiracy.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.599
There were conspiracies
within it, of course.

00:05:20.044 --> 00:05:22.137
But it was a cultural momentum.

00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:24.730
It was millions of people
making millions of decisions

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:26.346
over an extended period of time,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.132
that fundamentally changed
not only the way that we build cities,

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:32.170
but it changed our expectations

00:05:32.194 --> 00:05:33.534
for our lives.

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:37.864
These changes were the foundations
for urban sprawl.

00:05:37.888 --> 00:05:40.002
We didn't call it sprawl at that time.

00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:41.553
We called it the future.

00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:42.967
And it was.

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.042
And we got all the highways
and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.796
It was a radical transformation,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.433
but it was built by a cultural momentum.

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:54.031
So it's important to not separate

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:56.529
the physical construction
of the places we live

00:05:56.553 --> 00:05:59.244
from other things that
are happening at that time.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.796
At that time,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.081
in the second half of the last century,

00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:05.097
science was curing disease

00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.990
and lifting us to the moon,

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:09.545
and the sexual revolution
was breaking down barriers,

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.681
and the Civil Rights Movement
began its march

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.640
toward the fulfillment
of our nation's promise.

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:19.401
Television, entertainment, food, travel,
business -- everything was changing,

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:22.725
and both the public
and private sectors were colluding

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.994
to give us the lives we wanted.

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.750
The Federal Highway Administration,

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:31.071
for example, didn't exist
before there were highways.

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:32.972
Think about it.

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:34.020
(Laughter)

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:37.031
Of course, today it's important
to understand and acknowledge

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:39.850
that those benefits accrued
to some groups of people

00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:41.146
and not to others.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.920
It was not an equitable cultural momentum.

00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:48.358
But when we look today
in wonder and disgust, maybe,

00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:50.845
at the metropolis sprawl before us,

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.621
we wonder if we're stuck.

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.708
Are we stuck with the legacy
of that inequity?

00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:59.837
Are we stuck with this dystopian
traffic hellscape?

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:03.455
Are we stuck with rampant
urban displacement,

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.861
with environmental degradation?

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:09.037
Are we stuck with social isolation

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.021
or political polarization?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.165
Are these the inevitable
and permanent outcomes?

00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:17.722
Or are they the result
of our collective cultural decisions

00:07:17.746 --> 00:07:19.462
that we've made for ourselves?

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:21.804
And if they are,

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:24.071
can't we change them?

00:07:24.803 --> 00:07:27.437
What I have learned
from our experience in Atlanta

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.970
is not an anomaly.

00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:31.365
Similar stories
are playing out everywhere,

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.202
where people are reclaiming
not only old railroads,

00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:38.085
but also degraded urban waterways
and obsolete roadways,

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:40.449
reinventing all of the infrastructure

00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:41.812
in their lives.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.760
Whether here in New York

00:07:43.784 --> 00:07:45.020
or in Houston

00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:46.347
or Miami,

00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.034
Detroit, Philadelphia,

00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:51.370
Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,

00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:53.031
Toronto and Paris,

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:57.183
cities big and small all over the world
are reclaiming and reinventing

00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:58.880
this infrastructure for themselves,

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:02.910
including the mother
of all catalyst infrastructure projects,

00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:04.987
the Los Angeles River,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.255
the revitalization effort
for which similarly started

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.653
as a grassroots movement,

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:12.013
has developed into a cultural momentum,

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:15.479
and is now in the early stages
of being transformed

00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:18.808
into some kind of life-affirming
infrastructure again,

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:23.227
this one with trails and parks
and fishing and boating

00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.186
and community revitalization,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.266
and of course, water quality
and flood control.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.770
It's already improving
the lives of people.

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:34.675
It's already changing the way
the rest of us think about Los Angeles.

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:37.376
This is more than just infrastructure.

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:40.190
We're building new lives for ourselves.

00:08:40.214 --> 00:08:43.768
It's a movement that includes
local food, urban agriculture,

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:46.038
craft beer, the maker movement,

00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:50.841
tech and design -- all of these things,
early indicators of a really radical shift

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:52.545
in the way we build cities.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.082
We're taking places like this

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:58.654
and transforming them into this.

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.037
And soon this.

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:05.730
And this is all exciting and good.

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:08.402
We're changing the world for the better.

00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:09.892
Good for us!

00:09:10.263 --> 00:09:12.636
And it is awesome -- I mean that.

00:09:12.956 --> 00:09:14.926
But our history of sprawl,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.886
and from what we can already see
with these catalyst projects today,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.094
we know and must remember

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:24.476
that big changes like this
don't usually benefit everyone.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:28.550
The market forces unleashed
by this cultural momentum

00:09:28.574 --> 00:09:30.999
often include the seemingly unstoppable

00:09:31.023 --> 00:09:35.508
and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,
prices and rents.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.308
This is urgent.

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:39.474
If we care, we have to stand up

00:09:39.498 --> 00:09:40.815
and speak out.

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:42.622
This should be a call to action,

00:09:42.646 --> 00:09:45.706
because the answer can't be
to not improve communities.

00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:51.191
The answer can't be to not build parks
and transit and grocery stores.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.128
The answer can't be
to hold communities down

00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.905
just to keep them affordable.

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:59.800
But we do have to follow through
and address the financial realities

00:09:59.824 --> 00:10:01.054
that we're facing.

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.534
This is hard, and it won't
happen on its own.

00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:06.770
We can do it, and I'm committed
to this goal in Atlanta,

00:10:06.794 --> 00:10:11.496
to sticking up again for people
who made it possible in the first place.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.794
We can't call it a success without them.

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:15.412
I certainly can't,

00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:18.368
because the people I made
commitments to all those years

00:10:18.392 --> 00:10:20.253
weren't abstract populations.

00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:22.435
They're my friends and neighbors.

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:24.109
They're people that I love.

00:10:24.974 --> 00:10:27.508
So even though it started
as my graduate thesis

00:10:27.532 --> 00:10:30.504
and I'm working hard for 16 years
with thousands of people

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:32.678
to help make this thing come to life,

00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:36.619
I know and believe that who
the BeltLine is being built for

00:10:36.643 --> 00:10:39.435
is just as important
as whether it's built at all.

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:41.391
Not just in Atlanta,

00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:43.413
but locally and globally,

00:10:43.437 --> 00:10:44.939
we have to understand

00:10:45.606 --> 00:10:48.967
this accountability to the people
whose lives we are changing,

00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:50.570
because this is us.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:53.800
We are the lives we're talking about.

00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:56.068
These places aren't inevitable.

00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:58.234
The places we live aren't inevitable,

00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:01.815
and if we want something different,
we just need to speak up.

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.413
We have to ensure that change
comes on our terms.

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:05.592
And to do that,

00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:09.888
we have to participate actively
in the process of shaping change.

00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:11.699
Thank you.

00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:13.636
(Applause)
