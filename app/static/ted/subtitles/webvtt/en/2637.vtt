00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.536
In 1987, Tina Lord
found herself in quite the pickle.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.856
See, this gold digger made sure
she married sweet Cord Roberts

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.536
just before he inherited millions.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.776
But when Cord found out
Tina loved his money

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.416
as much as she loved him,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.696
he dumped her.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.616
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.136
until they hooked up again.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.816
So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.576
and then made sure Cord didn't find out
Tina was pregnant with his baby.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.496
So Tina, still married
but thinking Cord didn't love her

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.696
flew to Argentina with Max.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.816
Cord finally figured out what was going on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.360
and rushed after them,
but he was too late.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.416
Tina had already been kidnapped,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.800
strapped to a raft
and sent over a waterfall.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.800
She and her baby were presumed dead.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.336
Cord was sad for a bit,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.816
but then he bounced right back

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.216
with a supersmart
archaeologist named Kate,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.736
and they had a gorgeous wedding

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.056
until Tina, seemingly back from the dead,
ran into the church holding a baby.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.760
"Stop!" she screamed.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.696
"Am I too late?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.800
Cord, I've come so far.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.880
This is your son."

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.896
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.096
is how the soap opera "One Life to Live"
introduced a love story

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.176
that lasted 25 years.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.536
(Laughter)

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.656
Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.576
you know the stories and the characters
can be exaggerated, larger than life,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.856
and if you're a fan,
you find that exaggeration fun,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.080
and if you're not,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.296
maybe you find them
melodramatic or unsophisticated.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.536
Maybe you think watching soap operas

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.816
is a waste of time,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.120
that their bigness means
their lessons are small or nonexistent.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.800
But I believe the opposite to be true.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.000
Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.336
So there are real life lessons
we can learn from soap operas,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.176
and those lessons
are as big and adventurous

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.320
as any soap opera storyline.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.896
Now, I've been a fan since I ran home
from the bus stop in second grade

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.616
desperate to catch the end
of Luke and Laura's wedding,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.016
the biggest moment
in "General Hospital" history.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.296
(Applause)

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.656
So you can imagine
how much I loved my eight years

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.656
as the assistant casting director
on "As the World Turns."

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.696
My job was watching soap operas,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.136
reading soap opera scripts

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.936
and auditioning actors
to be on soap operas.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.256
So I know my stuff.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.536
(Laughter)

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.856
And yes, soap operas

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.176
are larger than life,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.896
drama on a grand scale,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.656
but our lives can be filled
with as much intensity,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.440
and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.136
We cycle through tragedy and joy

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.096
just like these characters.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.576
We cross thresholds, fight demons
and find salvation unexpectedly,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.576
and we do it again and again and again,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.336
but just like soaps,
we can flip the script,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.616
which means we can learn
from these characters

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.456
that move like bumblebees,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.056
looping and swerving through life.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.336
And we can use those lessons

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.280
to craft our own life stories.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.880
Soap operas teach us to push away doubt

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.776
and believe in our capacity

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.416
for bravery, vulnerability,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.256
adaptability and resilience.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.576
And most importantly, they show us

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.160
it's never too late to change your story.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.096
So with that, let's start
with soap opera lesson one:

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.096
surrender is not an option.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.096
(Laughter)

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.696
"All My Children"'s Erica Kane
was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.176
a hyperbolically self-important princess

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
who deep down was scrappy and daring.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.416
Now, in her 41 years on TV,
perhaps Erica's most famous scene

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.416
is her alone in the woods

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.176
suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.456
She screamed at the bear,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.896
"You may not do this!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.576
Do you understand me?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.496
You may not come near me!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.416
I am Erica Kane

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.056
and you are a filthy beast!"

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.896
(Laughter)

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.576
And of course the bear left,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.416
so what that teaches us

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.496
is obstacles are to be expected

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.240
and we can choose to surrender
or we can stand and fight.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.056
Pandora's Tim Westergren
knows this better than most.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.320
You might even call him
the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.055
Tim and his cofounders
launched the company

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.815
with two million dollars in funding.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.560
They were out of cash the next year.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.080
Now, lots of companies fold at that point,
but Tim chose to fight.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.776
He maxed out 11 credit cards
and racked up six figures in personal debt

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.120
and it still wasn't enough.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.536
So every two weeks for two years on payday
he stood in front of his employees

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.280
and he asked them
to sacrifice their salaries,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.496
and it worked.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.336
More than 50 people deferred
two million dollars,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.216
and now, more than a decade later,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.560
Pandora is worth billions.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.816
When you believe that there is a way

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.216
around or through
whatever is in front of you,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.776
that surrender is not an option,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.720
you can overcome enormous obstacles.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.936
Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.000
sacrifice your ego
and drop the superiority complex.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.296
Now, this is scary.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.920
It's an acknowledgment
of need or fallibility.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.896
Maybe it's even an admission

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.600
that we're not as special
as we might like to think.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.536
Stephanie Forrester
of "The Bold and the Beautiful"

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.296
thought she was pretty darn special.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.816
She thought she was so special,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.536
she didn't need to mix
with the riffraff from the valley,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.656
and she made sure
valley girl Brooke knew it.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.856
But after nearly 25 years
of epic fighting,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.760
Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.696
They made amends,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.736
archenemies became soul mates

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.096
and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.640
and here's our takeaway.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.976
Drop your ego.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.896
Life is not about you.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.536
It's about us,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.376
and our ability to experience joy

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.896
and love and to improve our reality

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.936
comes only when we make
ourselves vulnerable

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.096
and we accept responsibility
for our actions

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.496
and our inactions,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.240
kind of like Howard Schultz,
the CEO of Starbucks.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.936
Now, after a great run as CEO,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.256
Howard stepped down in 2000,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.496
and Starbucks quickly overextended itself

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.800
and stock prices fell.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.456
Howard rejoined the team in 2008,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.496
and one of the first things he did

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.680
was apologize to all 180,000 employees.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.240
He apologized.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.776
And then he asked for help,
honesty, and ideas in return.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.376
And now, Starbucks has more than doubled

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.600
its net revenue since Howard came back.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.096
So sacrifice your desire
to be right or safe all the time.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.320
It's not helping anyone, least of all you.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.440
Sacrifice your ego.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.696
Soap opera lesson three:

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.000
evolution is real.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.936
You're not meant to be static characters.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.896
On television, static equals boring
and boring equals fired.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.800
Characters are supposed
to grow and change.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.016
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.296
can make for some rough transitions,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.696
particularly when a character
is played by one person yesterday

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.560
and played by someone new today.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.920
Recasting happens all the time on soaps.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.376
Over the last 20 years,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.256
four different actors
have played the same key role

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.840
of Carly Benson on "General Hospital."

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.856
Each new face triggered a change
in the character's life and personality.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.936
Now, there was always
an essential nugget of Carly in there,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.800
but the character and the story
adapted to whomever was playing her.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.600
And here's what that means for us.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.016
While we may not swap faces
in our own lives,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.936
we can evolve too.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.560
We can choose to draw a circle
around our feet and stay in that spot,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.856
or we can open ourselves to opportunities

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.600
like Carly, who went
from nursing student to hotel owner,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.960
or like Julia Child.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.376
Julia was a World War II spy,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.736
and when the war ended,
she got married, moved to France,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.560
and decided to give
culinary school a shot.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.760
Julia, her books and her TV shows
revolutionized the way America cooks.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.936
We all have the power
to initiate change in our lives,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.920
to evolve and adapt.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.376
We make the choice,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.976
but sometimes life chooses for us,
and we don't get a heads up.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.176
Surprise slams us in the face.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.336
You're flat on the ground,
the air is gone,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.159
and you need resuscitation.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.135
So thank goodness
for soap opera lesson four:

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.416
resurrection is possible.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.856
(Laughter)

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.720
(Applause)

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.136
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"'
Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.696
but not really, because in 1984

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.456
he died when his car
plunged into the harbor,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.016
and yet he was back in 1985
with a brain tumor.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.056
(Laughter)

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.696
But before the tumor could kill him,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.720
Marlena shot him, and he tumbled
off a catwalk to his death.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.736
And so it went for 30 years.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.256
(Laughter)

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.416
Even when we saw the body,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.656
we knew better.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.280
He's called the Phoenix for a reason.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.976
And here's what that means for us.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.456
As long as the show is still on the air,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.576
or you're still breathing,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.256
nothing is permanent.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.600
Resurrection is possible.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.256
Now, of course, just like life,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.560
soap operas do ultimately
meet the big finale.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.256
CBS canceled my show,
"As The World Turns," in December 2009,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.856
and we shot our final episode

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.080
in June 2010.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.336
It was six months of dying

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.440
and I rode that train
right into the mountain.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.976
And even though we were
in the middle of a huge recession

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.816
and millions of people
were struggling to find work,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.136
I somehow thought everything would be OK.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.856
So I packed up the kids
and the Brooklyn apartment,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.216
and we moved in with my in-laws

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.456
in Alabama.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.560
(Laughter)

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.656
Three months later, nothing was OK.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.896
That was when I watched
the final episode air,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.360
and I realized the show
was not the only fatality.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.240
I was one too.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.696
I was unemployed
and living on the second floor

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.296
of my in-laws' home,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.096
and that's enough
to make anyone feel dead inside.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.016
(Laughter)

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.176
But I knew my story wasn't over,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.416
that it couldn't be over.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.600
I just had to tap into everything
I had ever learned about soap operas.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.896
I had to be brave like Erica
and refuse to surrender,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.120
so every day, I made a decision to fight.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.576
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.136
and sacrifice my ego.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.200
I had to ask for help
a lot of times across many states.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.216
I had to be adaptable like Carly

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.776
and evolve my skills,
my mindset, and my circumstances,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.776
and then I had to be
resilient, like Stefano,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.456
and resurrect myself and my career

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.600
like a phoenix from the ashes.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.400
Eventually I got an interview.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.576
After 15 years in news and entertainment,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.536
nine months of unemployment

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.640
and this one interview,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.040
I had an offer for an entry level job.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.896
I was 37 years old

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.600
and I was back from the dead.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.336
We will all experience
what looks like an ending,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.440
and we can choose to make it a beginning.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.216
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously
survived that waterfall,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.936
and because I hate to leave
a cliffhanger hanging,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.136
Tina and Cord did get divorced,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.920
but they got remarried three times
before the show went off the air in 2012.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.816
So remember,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.560
as long as there is breath in your body,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.680
it's never too late to change your story.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.696
Thank you.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.520
(Applause)
