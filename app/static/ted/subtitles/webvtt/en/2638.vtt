00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.376
When I was six years old,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.640
I received my gifts.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.776
My first grade teacher
had this brilliant idea.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.136
She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.160
but also learning the virtue
of complimenting each other.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.536
So she had all of us
come to the front of the classroom,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.536
and she bought all of us gifts
and stacked them in the corner.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.776
And she said,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.456
"Why don't we just stand here
and compliment each other?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.056
If you hear your name called,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.280
go and pick up your gift and sit down."

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.000
What a wonderful idea, right?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.096
What could go wrong?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.640
(Laughter)

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.456
Well, there were 40 of us to start with,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.936
and every time I heard
someone's name called,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.760
I would give out the heartiest cheer.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.776
And then there were 20 people left,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.576
and 10 people left,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.960
and five left ...

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.936
and three left.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.160
And I was one of them.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.320
And the compliments stopped.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.600
Well, at that moment, I was crying.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.616
And the teacher was freaking out.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.296
She was like, "Hey, would anyone
say anything nice about these people?"

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.536
(Laughter)

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.536
"No one? OK, why don't you
go get your gift and sit down.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.816
So behave next year --

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.936
someone might say
something nice about you."

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.720
(Laughter)

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.136
Well, as I'm describing this you,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.536
you probably know
I remember this really well.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.160
(Laughter)

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.896
But I don't know who felt worse that day.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.096
Was it me or the teacher?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.256
She must have realized
that she turned a team-building event

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.080
into a public roast
for three six-year-olds.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.056
And without the humor.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.416
You know, when you see
people get roasted on TV,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.656
it was funny.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.538
There was nothing funny about that day.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.336
So that was one version of me,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.856
and I would die to avoid
being in that situation again --

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.760
to get rejected in public again.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.896
That's one version.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.376
Then fast-forward eight years.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.376
Bill Gates came to my hometown --

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.616
Beijing, China --

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.856
to speak,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.616
and I saw his message.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.936
I fell in love with that guy.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.856
I thought, wow,
I know what I want to do now.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.016
That night I wrote a letter to my family

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.336
telling them: "By age 25,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.976
I will build the biggest
company in the world,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.936
and that company will buy Microsoft."

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.856
(Laughter)

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.496
I totally embraced this idea
of conquering the world --

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.720
domination, right?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.976
And I didn't make this up,
I did write that letter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.336
And here it is --

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.336
(Laughter)

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.176
You don't have to read this through --

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.976
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.240
This is also bad handwriting,
but I did highlight some key words.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.816
You get the idea.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.616
(Laughter)

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.840
So ...

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.296
that was another version of me:

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000
one who will conquer the world.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.336
Well, then two years later,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.296
I was presented with the opportunity
to come to the United States.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.896
I jumped on it,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.136
because that was
where Bill Gates lived, right?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.376
(Laughter)

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.040
I thought that was the start
of my entrepreneur journey.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.856
Then, fast-forward another 14 years.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.296
I was 30.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.696
Nope, I didn't build that company.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.256
I didn't even start.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.256
I was actually a marketing manager
for a Fortune 500 company.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.896
And I felt I was stuck;

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.120
I was stagnant.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.296
Why is that?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.560
Where is that 14-year-old
who wrote that letter?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.957
It's not because he didn't try.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.536
It's because every time I had a new idea,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.536
every time I wanted to try something new,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.776
even at work --

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.536
I wanted to make a proposal,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.096
I wanted to speak up
in front of people in a group --

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.936
I felt there was this constant battle

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.736
between the 14-year-old
and the six-year-old.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.896
One wanted to conquer the world --

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.136
make a difference --

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.280
another was afraid of rejection.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.480
And every time that six-year-old won.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.736
And this fear even persisted
after I started my own company.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.896
I mean, I started
my own company when I was 30 --

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.336
if you want to be Bill Gates,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.400
you've got to start
sooner or later, right?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.616
When I was an entrepreneur,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.536
I was presented
with an investment opportunity,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.360
and then I was turned down.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.776
And that rejection hurt me.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.400
It hurt me so bad
that I wanted to quit right there.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.496
But then I thought,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.360
hey, would Bill Gates quit
after a simple investment rejection?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.776
Would any successful
entrepreneur quit like that?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.176
No way.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.176
And this is where it clicked for me.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.016
OK, I can build a better company.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.256
I can build a better
team or better product,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.816
but one thing for sure:

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.696
I've got to be a better leader.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.240
I've got to be a better person.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.096
I cannot let that six-year-old
keep dictating my life anymore.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.200
I have to put him back in his place.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.416
So this is where I went online
and looked for help.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.696
Google was my friend.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.856
(Laughter)

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.440
I searched, "How do I overcome
the fear of rejection?"

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.816
I came up with a bunch
of psychology articles

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.696
about where the fear
and pain are coming from.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.016
Then I came up with a bunch
of "rah-rah" inspirational articles

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.421
about "Don't take it personally,
just overcome it."

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.856
Who doesn't know that?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.456
(Laughter)

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.616
But why was I still so scared?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.656
Then I found this website by luck.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.056
It's called rejectiontherapy.com.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.616
(Laughter)

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.576
"Rejection Therapy" was this game
invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.296
His name is Jason Comely.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.416
And basically the idea is for 30 days
you go out and look for rejection,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.696
and every day get rejected at something,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.240
and then by the end,
you desensitize yourself from the pain.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.896
And I loved that idea.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.456
(Laughter)

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.616
I said, "You know what?
I'm going to do this.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.656
And I'll feel myself
getting rejected 100 days."

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.096
And I came up with my own rejection ideas,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.600
and I made a video blog out of it.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.536
And so here's what I did.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.176
This is what the blog looked like.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.400
Day One ...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.296
(Laughter)

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.560
Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.456
So this is where I went
to where I was working.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.216
I came downstairs

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.456
and I saw this big guy
sitting behind a desk.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.216
He looked like a security guard.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.776
So I just approached him.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.536
And I was just walking

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.896
and that was the longest
walk of my life --

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.056
hair on the back
of my neck standing up,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.536
I was sweating and my heart was pounding.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.776
And I got there and said,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.456
"Hey, sir, can I borrow
100 dollars from you?"

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.816
(Laughter)

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.640
And he looked up, he's like, "No."

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.840
"Why?"

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.496
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry."

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.235
Then I turned around,
and I just ran.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.619
(Laughter)

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.696
I felt so embarrassed.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.176
But because I filmed myself --

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.336
so that night I was watching
myself getting rejected,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.456
I just saw how scared I was.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.936
I looked like this kid
in "The Sixth Sense."

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.376
I saw dead people.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.016
(Laughter)

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.576
But then I saw this guy.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.496
You know, he wasn't that menacing.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.896
He was a chubby, loveable guy,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.376
and he even asked me, "Why?"

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.816
In fact, he invited me to explain myself.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.416
And I could've said many things.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.736
I could've explained,
I could've negotiated.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.200
I didn't do any of that.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.200
All I did was run.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.320
I felt, wow, this is like
a microcosm of my life.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.456
Every time I felt the slightest rejection,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.616
I would just run as fast as I could.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.896
And you know what?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.736
The next day, no matter what happens,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.256
I'm not going to run.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480
I'll stay engaged.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.136
Day Two: Request a "burger refill."

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.136
(Laughter)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.456
It's when I went to a burger joint,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.976
I finished lunch,
and I went to the cashier and said,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.576
"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.776
(Laughter)

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.256
He was all confused,
like, "What's a burger refill?"

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.536
(Laughter)

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.216
I said, "Well, it's just like
a drink refill but with a burger."

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.736
And he said, "Sorry,
we don't do burger refill, man."

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.096
(Laughter)

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.176
So this is where rejection happened
and I could have run, but I stayed.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.336
I said, "Well, I love your burgers,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.776
I love your joint,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.896
and if you guys do a burger refill,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.256
I will love you guys more."

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.536
(Laughter)

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.176
And he said, "Well, OK,
I'll tell my manager about it,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.176
and maybe we'll do it,
but sorry, we can't do this today."

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.616
Then I left.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.496
And by the way,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.776
I don't think they've
ever done burger refill.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.016
(Laughter)

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.600
I think they're still there.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.456
But the life and death feeling
I was feeling the first time

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.816
was no longer there,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.576
just because I stayed engaged --

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.216
because I didn't run.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.600
I said, "Wow, great,
I'm already learning things.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.736
Great."

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.960
And then Day Three:
Getting Olympic Doughnuts.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.280
This is where my life
was turned upside down.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.736
I went to a Krispy Kreme.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.976
It's a doughnut shop

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.616
in mainly the Southeastern part
of the United States.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.496
I'm sure they have some here, too.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.775
And I went in,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.936
I said, "Can you make me doughnuts
that look like Olympic symbols?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.856
Basically, you interlink
five doughnuts together ... "

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.120
I mean there's no way
they could say yes, right?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.016
The doughnut maker took me so seriously.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.256
(Laughter)

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.496
So she put out paper,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.696
started jotting down
the colors and the rings,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.736
and is like, "How can I make this?"

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.656
And then 15 minutes later,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.096
she came out with a box
that looked like Olympic rings.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.776
And I was so touched.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.936
I just couldn't believe it.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.720
And that video got
over five million views on Youtube.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.536
The world couldn't believe that either.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.080
(Laughter)

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.656
You know, because of that
I was in newspapers,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.096
in talk shows, in everything.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.616
And I became famous.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.776
A lot of people
started writing emails to me

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.336
and saying, "What you're
doing is awesome."

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.896
But you know, fame and notoriety
did not do anything to me.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.736
What I really wanted to do was learn,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.976
and to change myself.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.616
So I turned the rest
of my 100 days of rejection

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.536
into this playground --

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.696
into this research project.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.800
I wanted to see what I could learn.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.016
And then I learned a lot of things.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.616
I discovered so many secrets.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.536
For example, I found if I just don't run,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.816
if I got rejected,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.896
I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,"

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.536
and the magic word is, "why."

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.656
So one day I went to a stranger's house,
I had this flower in my hand,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.096
knocked on the door and said,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.376
"Hey, can I plant this flower
in your backyard?"

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.936
(Laughter)

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.680
And he said, "No."

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.376
But before he could leave I said,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.336
"Hey, can I know why?"

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.416
And he said, "Well, I have this dog

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.776
that would dig up
anything I put in the backyard.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.456
I don't want to waste your flower.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.656
If you want to do this,
go across the street and talk to Connie.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.896
She loves flowers."

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.136
So that's what I did.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.216
I went across and knocked
on Connie's door.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.096
And she was so happy to see me.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.816
(Laughter)

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.216
And then half an hour later,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.296
there was this flower
in Connie's backyard.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.736
I'm sure it looks better now.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.056
(Laughter)

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.016
But had I left
after the initial rejection,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.256
I would've thought,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.336
well, it's because
the guy didn't trust me,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.576
it's because I was crazy,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.016
because I didn't dress up well,
I didn't look good.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.256
It was none of those.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.976
It was because what I offered
did not fit what he wanted.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.256
And he trusted me enough
to offer me a referral,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.936
using a sales term.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.480
I converted a referral.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.776
Then one day --

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.696
and I also learned that I can
actually say certain things

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.656
and maximize my chance to get a yes.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.896
So for example,
one day I went to a Starbucks,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.496
and asked the manager,
"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.896
He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?"

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.016
I said, "Do you know
those Walmart greeters?

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.456
You know, those people who say
'hi' to you before you walk in the store,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.696
and make sure you
don't steal stuff, basically?

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.856
I want to give a Walmart experience
to Starbucks customers."

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.336
(Laughter)

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.360
Well, I'm not sure
that's a good thing, actually --

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.096
Actually, I'm pretty sure
it's a bad thing.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.176
And he was like, "Oh" --

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.456
yeah, this is how he looked,
his name is Eric --

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.056
and he was like, "I'm not sure."

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.136
This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.816
Then I ask him, "Is that weird?"

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.880
He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man."

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.656
But as soon as he said that,
his whole demeanor changed.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.616
It's as if he's putting
all the doubt on the floor.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.376
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.656
just don't get too weird."

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.096
(Laughter)

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.496
So for the next hour
I was the Starbucks greeter.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.656
I said "hi" to every customer
that walked in,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.056
and gave them holiday cheers.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.736
By the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.976
don't be a greeter.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.216
(Laughter)

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.440
It was really boring.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.136
But then I found I could do this
because I mentioned, "Is that weird?"

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.296
I mentioned the doubt that he was having.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.856
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?",
that means I wasn't weird.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.416
That means I was actually
thinking just like him,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.816
seeing this as a weird thing.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.096
And again, and again,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.256
I learned that if I mention
some doubt people might have

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.096
before I ask the question,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.376
I gained their trust.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.360
People were more likely to say yes to me.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.136
And then I learned
I could fulfill my life dream ...

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.576
by asking.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.696
You know, I came
from four generations of teachers,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.536
and my grandma has always told me,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.856
"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.936
but it'd be great
if you became a teacher."

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.376
(Laughter)

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.656
But I wanted to be
an entrepreneur, so I didn't.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.056
But it has always been my dream
to actually teach something.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.896
So I said, "What if I just ask

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.536
and teach a college class?"

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.016
I lived in Austin at the time,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.096
so I went to University
of Texas at Austin

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.336
and knocked on professors' doors
and said, "Can I teach your class?"

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.856
I didn't get anywhere
the first couple of times.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.376
But because I didn't run --
I kept doing it --

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.736
and on the third try
the professor was very impressed.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.816
He was like, "No one
has done this before."

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.856
And I came in prepared
with powerpoints and my lesson.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.936
He said, "Wow, I can use this.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.296
Why don't you come back in two months?
I'll fit you in my curriculum."

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.416
And two months later
I was teaching a class.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.696
This is me -- you probably can't see,
this is a bad picture.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.496
You know, sometimes you get
rejected by lighting, you know?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.720
(Laughter)

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.896
But wow --

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.656
when I finished teaching that class,
I walked out crying,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.456
because I thought

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.776
I could fulfill my life dream
just by simply asking.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.456
I used to think I have to accomplish
all these things --

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.096
have to be a great entrepreneur,
or get a PhD to teach --

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.656
but no, I just asked,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.880
and I could teach.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.776
And in that picture,
which you can't see,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.096
I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.656
Why? Because in my research I found
that people who really change the world,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.616
who change the way we live
and the way we think,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.736
are the people who were met
with initial and often violent rejections.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.816
People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.896
like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.456
or even Jesus Christ.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.856
These people did not
let rejection define them.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.040
They let their own reaction
after rejection define themselves.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.480
And they embraced rejection.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.576
And we don't have to be those people
to learn about rejection,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.856
and in my case,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.896
rejection was my curse,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.176
was my boogeyman.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.376
It has bothered me my whole life
because I was running away from it.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.120
Then I started embracing it.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.520
I turned that into
the biggest gift in my life.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.776
I started teaching people
how to turn rejections into opportunities.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.816
I use my blog, I use my talk,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.736
I use the book I just published,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.320
and I'm even building technology to help
people overcome their fear of rejection.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.936
When you get rejected in life,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.176
when you are facing the next obstacle

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.216
or next failure,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.056
consider the possibilities.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.296
Don't run.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.536
If you just embrace them,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.640
they might become your gifts as well.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.376
Thank you.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.744
(Applause)
