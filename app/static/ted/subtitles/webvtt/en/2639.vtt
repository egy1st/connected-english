00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.256
Our lives depend

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.040
on a world we can't see.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.936
Think about your week so far.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.176
Have you watched TV, used GPS,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.160
checked the weather or even ate a meal?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.416
These many things
that enable our daily lives

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.296
rely either directly or indirectly

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.016
on satellites.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.976
And while we often take for granted

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.536
the services that satellites provide us,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.376
the satellites themselves
deserve our attention

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.376
as they are leaving a lasting mark

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.119
on the space they occupy.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.336
People around the world
rely on satellite infrastructure every day

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.416
for information, entertainment
and to communicate.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.296
There's agricultural
and environmental monitoring,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.376
Internet connectivity, navigation.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.096
Satellites even play a role

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
in the operation of our financial
and energy markets.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.016
But these satellites that we rely on

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.696
day in and day out

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.376
have a finite life.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.296
They might run out of propellant,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.856
they could malfunction,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.575
or they may just naturally
reach the end of their mission life.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.736
At this point, these satellites
effectively become space junk,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.080
cluttering the orbital environment.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.456
So imagine you're driving down the highway
on a beautiful, sunny day

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.896
out running errands.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.576
You've got your music cranked,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.056
your windows rolled down,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.776
with the cool breeze
blowing through your hair.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.000
Feels nice, right?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.016
Everything is going smoothly

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.696
until suddenly
your car stutters and stalls

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.560
right in the middle of the highway.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.456
So now you have no choice
but to abandon your car

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.920
where it is on the highway.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.536
Maybe you were lucky enough

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.456
to be able to move it out of the way
and into a shoulder lane

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.616
so that it's out of the way
of other traffic.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.896
A couple of hours ago,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.400
your car was a useful machine
that you relied on in your everyday life.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.536
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.240
taking up space in a valuable
transportation network.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.096
And imagine international roadways
all cluttered with broken down vehicles

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.976
that are just getting in the way
of other traffic.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.896
And imagine the debris
that would be strewn everywhere

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.376
if a collision actually happened,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.776
thousands of smaller pieces of debris

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.720
becoming new obstacles.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.256
This is the paradigm
of the satellite industry.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.416
Satellites that are no longer working

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.256
are often left to deorbit
over many, many years,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.816
or only moved out of the way
as a temporary solution.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.096
And there are no
international laws in space

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.760
to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.936
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.216
was launched in 1957,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.880
and in that year, there were
only a total of three launch attempts.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.056
Decades later and dozens of countries
from all around the world

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.456
have launched thousands
of more satellites into orbit,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.216
and the frequency of launches
is only going to increase in the future,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.816
especially if you consider
things like the possibility

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.440
of 900-plus satellite
constellations being launched.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.616
Now, we send satellites
to different orbits

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.696
depending on what they're needed for.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.056
One of the most common places
we send satellites

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.656
is the low Earth orbit,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.656
possibly to image the surface of Earth

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.080
at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.176
Satellites there are naturally buffeted
by Earth's atmosphere,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.136
so their orbits naturally decay,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.696
and they'll eventually burn up,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680
probably within a couple of decades.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.536
Another common place we send satellites

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.216
is the geostationary orbit

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.840
at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.496
Satellites there remain in the same place
above Earth as the Earth rotates,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.800
which enables things like communications
or television broadcast, for example.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.760
Satellites in high orbits like these
could remain there for centuries.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.136
And then there's the orbit
coined "the graveyard,"

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.776
the ominous junk or disposal orbits,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.656
where some satellites
are intentionally placed

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.896
at the end of their life

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.680
so that they're out of the way
of common operational orbits.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.376
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites
launched since the late 1950s,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.760
only about one in seven
is currently operational,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.256
and in addition to the satellites
that are no longer working,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.776
there's also hundreds of thousands
of marble-sized debris

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.216
and millions of paint chip-sized debris

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.240
that are also orbiting around the Earth.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.656
Space debris is a major risk
to space missions,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.680
but also to the satellites
that we rely on each and every day.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.936
Now, because space debris and junk
has become increasingly worrisome,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.576
there have been some national
and international efforts

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.096
to develop technical standards

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.040
to help us limit the generation
of additional debris.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.736
So for example, there are recommendations

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.856
for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.296
to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.416
but that's still a really long time,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.760
especially if a satellite
hasn't been working for years.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.376
There's also mandates
for those dead geostationary spacecraft

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640
to be moved into a graveyard orbit.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.176
But neither of these guidelines
is binding under international law,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.976
and the understanding is that they will be
implemented through national mechanisms.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.456
These guidelines are also not long-term,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.896
they're not proactive,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.256
nor do they address
the debris that's already up there.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.120
They're only in place
to limit the future creation of debris.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.840
Space junk is no one's responsibility.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.536
Now, Mount Everest is actually
an interesting comparison

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.776
of a new approach to how
we interact with our environments,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.096
as it's often given the dubious honor

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.120
of being the world's highest garbage dump.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.296
Decades after the first conquest
of the world's highest peak,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.576
tons of rubbish left behind by climbers

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.536
has started to raise concern,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.296
and you may have read in the news
that there's speculation

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.376
that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.960
with stricter enforcement
of penalties and legal obligations.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.016
The goal, of course,
is to persuade climbers

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.216
to clean up after themselves,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.136
so maybe local not-for-profits will pay
climbers who bring down extra waste,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.640
or expeditions might organize
voluntary cleanup trips.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.376
And yet still many climbers feel

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.640
that independent groups
should police themselves.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.936
There's no simple or easy answer,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.016
and even well-intentioned
efforts at conservation

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.880
often run into problems.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.416
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't do everything in our power

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.760
to protect the environments
that we rely and depend on,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.456
and like Everest, the remote location
and inadequate infrastructure

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.896
of the orbital environment

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.280
make waste disposal a challenging problem.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.456
But we simply cannot reach new heights

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.536
and create an even higher garbage dump,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.720
one that's out of this world.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.496
The reality of space

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.096
is that if a component
on a satellite breaks down,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.016
there really are limited
opportunities for repairs,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.080
and only at great cost.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.256
But what if we were smarter
about how we designed satellites?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.576
What if all satellites,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.896
regardless of what country
they were built in,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.816
had to be standardized in some way

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.376
for recycling, servicing

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.880
or active deorbiting?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.096
What if there actually were
international laws with teeth

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.896
that enforced end-of-life
disposal of satellites

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.056
instead of moving them out of the way

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.680
as a temporary solution?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.496
Or maybe satellite manufacturers
need to be charged a deposit

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.816
to even launch a satellite into orbit,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.296
and that deposit would only be returned

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.856
if the satellite was disposed of properly

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.600
or if they cleaned up
some quota of debris.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.016
Or maybe a satellite
needs to have technology on board

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.800
to help accelerate deorbit.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.976
There are some encouraging signs.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.696
The UK's TechDemoSat-1,
launched in 2014, for example,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.656
was designed for end-of-life disposal

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.616
via a small drag sail.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.216
This works for the satellite
because it's small,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.936
but satellites that are higher
or in larger orbits

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.816
or are larger altogether,
like the size of school buses,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.256
will require other disposal options.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.256
So maybe you get into things
like high-powered lasers

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.096
or tugging using nets or tethers,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.440
as crazy as those sound in the short term.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.056
And then one really cool possibility

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.400
is the idea of orbital tow trucks
or space mechanics.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.456
Imagine if a robotic arm

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.336
on some sort of space tow truck

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.656
could fix the broken components
on a satellite,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.520
making them usable again.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.176
Or what if that very same robotic arm

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.536
could refuel the propellant tank
on a spacecraft

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.536
that relies on chemical propulsion

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.039
just like you or I would refuel
the fuel tanks on our cars?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.216
Robotic repair and maintenance

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.960
could extend the lives of hundreds
of satellites orbiting around the Earth.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.176
Whatever the disposal
or cleanup options we come up with,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.176
it's clearly not just a technical problem.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.256
There's also complex space laws
and politics that we have to sort out.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.440
Simply put, we haven't found a way
to use space sustainably yet.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.616
Exploring, innovating
to change the way we live and work

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.616
are what we as humans do,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.136
and in space exploration,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.416
we're literally moving
beyond the boundaries of Earth.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.096
But as we push thresholds
in the name of learning and innovation,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.600
we must remember that accountability
for our environments never goes away.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.696
There is without doubt congestion
in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.056
and we cannot keep
launching new satellites

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.376
to replace the ones that have broken down

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.456
without doing something about them first,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.936
just like we would never
leave a broken down car

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
in the middle of the highway.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.336
Next time you use your phone,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.856
check the weather or use your GPS,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.136
think about the satellite technologies
that make those activities possible.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.016
But also think about the very impact

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.336
that the satellites have
on the environment surrounding Earth,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.056
and help spread the message
that together we must reduce our impact.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.616
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.216
and our gateway to exploration.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.760
It's up to us to keep it that way.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.376
Thank you.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.480
(Applause)
