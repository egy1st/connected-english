00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first question is this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our country has two exploration programs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we have other manifestations of space exploration.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, there's also another program,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to explore the oceans for 1,600 years.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Why are people afraid of the ocean?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that has nothing to offer?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
OK. And what we're going to do

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And what I'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to make it right now in case I forget.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Everything I'm going to present to you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
was not in my textbooks when I went to school.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I had to give the wrong answer to get an A.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In today's context, it was a bunch of crap,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
All the things we're going to walk through

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
were mostly discoveries made by accident.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Mostly discoveries made by accident.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We were looking for something and found something else.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And everything we're going to talk about

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I have a characterization.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It gives you the false impression it's a map.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It is not a map.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In fact, I have another version at my office

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I don't know," saying,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We had more exploration ships down there

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
put all the resources on the continents.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Laughter)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You know, it's just ludicrous.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I believe in just enriching the economy.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And as I will point out later in the presentation,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
have all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Why? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Back then -- actually my first expedition

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!"

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
with mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
was to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and go down to the bottom.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
In fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
at the average depth of the Earth --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But I was enraptured, and in my graduate years

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This is on a Mercator projection.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But if you were to put it on an equal area projection,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
of the Earth's total surface area.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So we went to the moon, played golf up there,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
where the great crustal plates are separating.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And like a living organism, you tear it open,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But no one had actually gone down

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
We went down into the Rift Valley.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
This is all accurate except for one thing -- it's pitch black.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's absolutely pitch black, because

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Most of our planet is in eternal darkness.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And with the absence of photosynthesis

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you have no plant life, and as a result,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
you have very little animal life living in this underworld.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Running along this entire 42,000 miles

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
are tens of thousands of active volcanoes.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Tens of thousands of active volcanoes.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
than on land by two orders of magnitude.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, it's a phenomenally active region,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And it's then being ripped open.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
In plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
it made sense: they would crush into one another,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
you would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It's not a flood, it was pushed up there.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We understood mountains under compression,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
must be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
except, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It was hot. It wasn't hot enough.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, we came up with multiple hypotheses:

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
there's little green people down there taking it;

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
there's all sorts of things going on.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, there must be underwater hot springs.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and did we find the missing heat.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We went up to them with our submersible.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
looked at it -- it pegged off scale.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
The pilot made this great observation: "That's hot."

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
(Laughter)

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
was 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of chemicals coming out of the ocean.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade:

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and you have massive heavy metal deposits

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that we're making in this mountain range.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We discovered a profusion of life,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
because we don't carry formaldehyde.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We went and found these incredible clam beds

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
sitting on the barren rock. Large clams,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
No mouth, no gut, no digestive system.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Their bodies had been totally taken over

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
through a process we now call chemosynthesis.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We did not know about this life system.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
We were not predicting it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So, we wanted to accelerate this process.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
average depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
two and half hours to get to work in the morning;

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Three hours of bottom time, average distance traveled -- one mile.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
(Laughter)

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
On a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
using robotic systems to replicate myself,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We began to introduce that in our explorations,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
with our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They came across new creatures they had not seen before.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But more importantly, they discovered

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
edifices down there that they did not understand.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and upside down pools. Look at that.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
How do you do that? That's water upside down.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and at this extreme environment.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
All the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
at a pH of 11, life existed.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So life was much more creative than we had ever thought.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and more life systems.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and they were oblivious to the existence of this system.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Recently, diving off -- in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
this time not upside down, right side up.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Bingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Instead of belching out lava, they were belching out

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
big, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and there were flows, not of lava,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I've never seen this before.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And yet we're only now penetrating it.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Finding the state of preservation.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?"

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It said Yorktown on the stern.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Laughter)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
More recently, finding ancient history.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
where they're not supposed to be.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
More recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Look at the state of preservation --

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
This ship sank 1,500 years ago.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Fortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The Okeanos Explorer on its mission.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Its mission is as good as you could get.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Applause)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It comes online this summer,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and it begins its journey of exploration.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We own all of that blue and yet,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
like I say, particularly the western territorial trust,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We have no idea what we're going to discover.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
or a new rock formation, a new life.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We're going to connect our command center,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
at the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
in the command center a second later.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But then it's connected through Internet too --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the new Internet highway that makes Internet one

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
look like a dirt road on the information highway --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
with 10 gigabits of bandwidth.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
have the maps disseminated out to the major universities.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
in this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We can then build a command center.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
This is a remote center at the University of Washington.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
We can disseminate.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
They can follow this expedition. I've started a program --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
where are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
called the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
so that we can use exploration,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and then give them what they're already ready for.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I would not let an adult drive my robot.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
You don't have enough gaming experience.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Applause)

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Because we want to create --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we want to create the classroom of tomorrow.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We need to be not only proud of our universities.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
We need to be proud of our middle schools.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And when we have the best middle schools in the world,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Because this is what we want. This is what we want.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
This is a young lady, not watching a football game,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
not watching a basketball game.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
You can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
(Applause)

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
This, I hope, will be a future engineer

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
or a future scientist in the battle for truth.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And my final question, my final question --

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And the technology is at hand.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
(Applause)
