WEBVTT

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.794
Like many of us,

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:05.190
I've had several careers in my life,

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.365
and although they've been varied,

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.276
my first job set the foundation
for all of them.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.313
I was a home-birth midwife
throughout my 20s.

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:20.747
Delivering babies taught me
valuable and sometimes surprising things,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.541
like how to start a car at 2am.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.363
when it's 10 degrees below zero.

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:26.388
(Laughter)

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:30.747
Or how to revive a father
who's fainted at the sight of blood.

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:31.822
(Laughter)

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.292
Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:36.537
to make a beautiful belly button.

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:40.346
But those aren't the things
that stuck with me or guided me

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.354
when I stopped being a midwife
and started other jobs.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:48.471
What stuck with me was this bedrock belief

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:53.507
that each one of us comes into this world
with a unique worth.

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.653
When I looked into the face of a newborn,

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:01.885
I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.751
that sense of unapologetic selfhood,

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:06.951
that unique spark.

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:12.343
I use the word "soul"
to describe that spark,

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:17.006
because it's the only word in English
that comes close to naming

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.742
what each baby brought into the room.

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:25.291
Every newborn was as singular
as a snowflake,

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:28.686
a matchless mash-up of biology

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.374
and ancestry and mystery.

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:34.031
And then that baby grows up,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.170
and in order to fit into the family,

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:38.235
to conform to the culture,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.529
to the community, to the gender,

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:44.116
that little one begins to cover its soul,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.654
layer by layer.

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:47.911
We're born this way,

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:49.563
but --

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:51.179
(Laughter)

00:01:51.203 --> 00:01:54.192
But as we grow, a lot
of things happen to us

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.050
that make us ...

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:02.959
want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity.

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.350
We've all done this.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.213
Everyone in this room is a former baby --

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:08.259
(Laughter)

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:10.768
with a distinctive birthright.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.776
But as adults, we spend so much
of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.778
like we have ADD:
authenticity deficit disorder.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.057
But not those babies --

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:24.323
not yet.

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:26.125
Their message to me was:

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:28.704
uncover your soul

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.921
and look for that soul-spark

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:33.155
in everyone else.

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.402
It's still there.

00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:37.934
And here's what I learned
from laboring women.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:41.414
Their message was about staying open,

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:43.665
even when things are painful.

00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:47.012
A woman's cervix normally looks like this.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:49.186
It's a tight little muscle

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.837
at the base of the uterus.

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:54.628
And during labor,
it has to stretch from this

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:56.958
to this.

00:02:56.982 --> 00:02:58.245
Ouch!

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.875
If you fight against that pain,

00:03:01.343 --> 00:03:03.027
you just create more pain,

00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:05.807
and you block what wants to be born.

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:10.320
I'll never forget the magic
that would happen

00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:12.987
when a woman stopped resisting the pain

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:15.472
and opened.

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:18.663
It was as if the forces
of the universe took notice

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.306
and sent in a wave of help.

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.895
I never forgot that message,

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.939
and now, when difficult
or painful things happen to me

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:29.502
in my life or my work,

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.537
of course at first I resist them,

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.785
but then I remember
what I learned from the mothers:

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.142
stay open.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:38.937
Stay curious.

00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:41.666
Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.

00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:44.475
Something new wants to be born.

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.609
And there was one more big soulful lesson,

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.427
and that one I learned
from Albert Einstein.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.725
He wasn't at any of the births, but --

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:53.781
(Laughter)

00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:56.447
It was a lesson about time.

00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:01.885
At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.059
that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.430
is an illusion.

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:10.236
We run round and round, faster and faster,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.883
trying to get somewhere.

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.439
And all the while,

00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:18.647
underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension

00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:23.987
where the past and the present
and the future merge

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.940
and become deep time.

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:30.109
And there's nowhere to get to.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:35.065
Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension,

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:36.750
"only being."

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:38.730
And he said when he experienced it,

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:41.061
he knew sacred awe.

00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:43.467
When I was delivering babies,

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.386
I was forced off the hamster wheel.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.189
Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours,

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.799
just breathing with the parents;

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.159
just being.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.615
And I got a big dose of sacred awe.

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:01.810
So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery.

00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:04.698
One: uncover your soul.

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:11.544
Two: when things get difficult
or painful, try to stay open.

00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:15.501
And three: every now and then,
step off your hamster wheel

00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.550
into deep time.

00:05:18.946 --> 00:05:22.133
Those lessons have served me
throughout my life,

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.314
but they really served me recently,

00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:29.926
when I took on the most
important job of my life thus far.

00:05:30.572 --> 00:05:34.938
Two years ago, my younger sister
came out of remission

00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:37.321
from a rare blood cancer,

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.042
and the only treatment left for her
was a bone marrow transplant.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.797
And against the odds,
we found a match for her,

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.731
who turned out to be me.

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:51.573
I come from a family of four girls,

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:58.488
and when my sisters found out that
I was my sister's perfect genetic match,

00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:00.842
their reaction was, "Really? You?"

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.249
(Laughter)

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:04.429
"A perfect match for her?"

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.983
Which is pretty typical for siblings.

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:10.197
In a sibling society,
there's lots of things.

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.418
There's love and there's friendship
and there's protection.

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.098
But there's also jealousy

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:17.887
and competition

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.033
and rejection and attack.

00:06:21.867 --> 00:06:27.805
In siblinghood, that's where we start
assembling many of those first layers

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:29.316
that cover our soul.

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.109
When I discovered I was my sister's match,

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:34.850
I went into research mode.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.784
And I discovered that

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.762
the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward.

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:44.046
You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.806
with massive doses of chemotherapy,

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:49.703
and then you replace that marrow

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:53.567
with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor.

00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:55.743
And then you do everything you can

00:06:55.767 --> 00:07:00.052
to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient.

00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:04.974
I also learned that bone marrow
transplants are fraught with danger.

00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:10.308
If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy,

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.918
she still would face other challenges.

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:16.252
My cells

00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.370
might attack her body.

00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:22.822
And her body might reject my cells.

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:25.291
They call this rejection or attack,

00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:26.941
and both could kill her.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.575
Rejection. Attack.

00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:32.282
Those words had a familiar ring

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.779
in the context of being siblings.

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:38.652
My sister and I had
a long history of love,

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:41.968
but we also had a long history
of rejection and attack,

00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:46.484
from minor misunderstandings
to bigger betrayals.

00:07:47.172 --> 00:07:49.306
We didn't have
the kind of the relationship

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.455
where we talked about the deeper stuff;

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:56.567
but, like many siblings and like people
in all kinds of relationships,

00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:59.941
we were hesitant to tell our truths,

00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:02.843
to reveal our wounds,

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:04.718
to admit our wrongdoings.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.071
But when I learned about
the dangers of rejection or attack,

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:12.399
I thought, it's time to change this.

00:08:13.073 --> 00:08:17.889
What if we left the bone marrow
transplant up to the doctors,

00:08:17.913 --> 00:08:23.722
but did something that we later came
to call our "soul marrow transplant?"

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:28.191
What if we faced any pain
we had caused each other,

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.922
and instead of rejection or attack,

00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:32.770
could we listen?

00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:34.698
Could we forgive?

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:36.556
Could we merge?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.051
Would that teach our cells to do the same?

00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:46.244
To woo my skeptical sister,
I turned to my parents' holy text:

00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:47.869
the New Yorker Magazine.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:49.809
(Laughter)

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:53.404
I sent her a cartoon from its pages

00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:57.053
as a way of explaining
why we should visit a therapist

00:08:57.077 --> 00:09:02.443
before having my bone marrow harvested
and transplanted into her body.

00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:03.712
Here it is.

00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:07.850
"I have never forgiven him for that thing
I made up in my head."

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:10.281
(Laughter)

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:12.251
I told my sister

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.787
we had probably been doing the same thing,

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:21.531
carting around made-up stories
in our heads that kept us separate.

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:25.076
And I told her that after the transplant,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.694
all of the blood flowing in her veins

00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:29.199
would be my blood,

00:09:29.223 --> 00:09:31.643
made from my marrow cells,

00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:36.530
and that inside the nucleus
of each of those cells

00:09:36.554 --> 00:09:38.820
is a complete set of my DNA.

00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:42.731
"I will be swimming around in you
for the rest of your life,"

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:45.514
I told my slightly horrified sister.

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:47.718
(Laughter)

00:09:47.742 --> 00:09:50.830
"I think we better clean up
our relationship."

00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:55.488
A health crisis makes people
do all sorts of risky things,

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:59.053
like quitting a job
or jumping out of an airplane

00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:01.594
and, in the case of my sister,

00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:05.352
saying "yes" to several therapy sessions,

00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:09.414
during which we got down to the marrow.

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:15.981
We looked at and released years of stories

00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:18.086
and assumptions about each other

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.188
and blame and shame

00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:23.750
until all that was left was love.

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:30.363
People have said I was brave
to undergo the bone marrow harvest,

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:31.657
but I don't think so.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.190
What felt brave to me

00:10:34.214 --> 00:10:37.399
was that other kind
of harvest and transplant,

00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:39.319
the soul marrow transplant,

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:43.750
getting emotionally naked
with another human being,

00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:47.243
putting aside pride and defensiveness,

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:48.903
lifting the layers

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:53.650
and sharing with each other
our vulnerable souls.

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:57.215
I called on those midwife lessons:

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.865
uncover your soul.

00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.604
Open to what's scary and painful.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.484
Look for the sacred awe.

00:11:05.872 --> 00:11:09.137
Here I am with my marrow cells
after the harvest.

00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:11.061
That's they call it -- "harvest,"

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:14.285
like it's some kind of bucolic
farm-to-table event --

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:15.467
(Laughter)

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:17.983
Which I can assure you it is not.

00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.857
And here is my brave, brave sister

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.577
receiving my cells.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:29.706
After the transplant, we began to spend
more and more time together.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.568
It was as if we were little girls again.

00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:36.505
The past and the present merged.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.735
We entered deep time.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:43.607
I left the hamster wheel of work and life

00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:45.293
to join my sister

00:11:45.992 --> 00:11:47.989
on that lonely island

00:11:48.444 --> 00:11:50.220
of illness and healing.

00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:52.791
We spent months together --

00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:54.577
in the isolation unit,

00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:56.959
in the hospital and in her home.

00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:00.100
Our fast-paced society

00:12:00.124 --> 00:12:05.284
does not support or even value
this kind of work.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:08.941
We see it as a disruption
of real life and important work.

00:12:09.426 --> 00:12:13.654
We worry about the emotional drain
and the financial cost --

00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:17.253
and, yes, there is a financial cost.

00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:18.951
But I was paid

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:24.457
in the kind of currency our culture
seems to have forgotten all about.

00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:27.271
I was paid in love.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:29.374
I was paid in soul.

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.568
I was paid in my sister.

00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:37.984
My sister said the year after transplant
was the best year of her life,

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.257
which was surprising.

00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:41.729
She suffered so much.

00:12:42.364 --> 00:12:45.596
But she said life never tasted as sweet,

00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:48.748
and that because of the soul-baring

00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:51.318
and the truth-telling
we had done with each other,

00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:55.537
she became more unapologetically herself

00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:56.952
with everyone.

00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:59.944
She said things
she'd always needed to say.

00:12:59.968 --> 00:13:02.756
She did things she always wanted to do.

00:13:03.263 --> 00:13:05.222
The same happened for me.

00:13:05.246 --> 00:13:10.595
I became braver about being authentic
with the people in my life.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.610
I said my truths,

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:18.229
but more important than that,
I sought the truth of others.

00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:23.097
It wasn't until
the final chapter of this story

00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:26.570
that I realized just how well
midwifery had trained me.

00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:30.129
After that best year of my sister's life,

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:32.154
the cancer came roaring back,

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:35.974
and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do.

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.664
They gave her just
a couple of months to live.

00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:42.573
The night before my sister died,

00:13:43.163 --> 00:13:45.871
I sat by her bedside.

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:48.178
She was so small and thin.

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:51.289
I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.

00:13:51.869 --> 00:13:55.414
It was my blood, her blood, our blood.

00:13:56.462 --> 00:13:59.314
When she died, part of me would die, too.

00:14:00.687 --> 00:14:05.359
I tried to make sense of it all,

00:14:05.383 --> 00:14:07.513
how becoming one with each other

00:14:08.008 --> 00:14:10.017
had made us more ourselves,

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.548
our soul selves,

00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:17.442
and how by facing and opening
to the pain of our past,

00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:19.965
we'd finally been delivered to each other,

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.901
and how by stepping out of time,

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:25.333
we would now be connected forever.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.910
My sister left me with so many things,

00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:33.085
and I'm going to leave you now
with just one of them.

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:37.795
You don't have to wait
for a life-or-death situation

00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:41.616
to clean up the relationships
that matter to you,

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.263
to offer the marrow of your soul

00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:47.345
and to seek it in another.

00:14:48.297 --> 00:14:50.215
We can all do this.

00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:55.082
We can be like a new kind
of first responder,

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:59.309
like the one to take
the first courageous step

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:01.658
toward the other,

00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:04.927
and to do something or try to do something

00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:08.073
other than rejection or attack.

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:10.711
We can do this with our siblings

00:15:10.735 --> 00:15:12.137
and our mates

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.417
and our friends and our colleagues.

00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:17.069
We can do this with the disconnection

00:15:17.093 --> 00:15:19.843
and the discord all around us.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.076
We can do this for the soul of the world.

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:25.820
Thank you.

00:15:25.844 --> 00:15:31.840
(Applause)
