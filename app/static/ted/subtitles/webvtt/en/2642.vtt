00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:03.004
What is a parent?

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.606
What is a parent?

00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:09.151
It's not an easy question.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.004
Today we have adoption,

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.604
stepfamilies,

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:15.085
surrogate mothers.

00:00:15.846 --> 00:00:18.259
Many parents face tough questions

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.680
and tough decisions.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:25.141
Shall we tell our child
about the sperm donation?

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.697
If so, when?

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:30.776
What words to use?

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:37.383
Sperm donors are often referred
to as "biological fathers,"

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:40.406
but should we really
be using the word "father?"

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.248
As a philosopher and social scientist,

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:48.494
I have been studying these questions
about the concept of parenthood.

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:52.116
But today, I will talk to you
about what I learned

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.280
from talking to parents and children.

00:00:55.377 --> 00:00:59.731
I will show you that they know
what matters most in a family,

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.286
even though their family
looks a little different.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:08.134
I will show you their creative ways
of dealing with tough questions.

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:13.037
But I will also show you
the parents' uncertainties.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.815
We interviewed couples

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:20.241
who received fertility treatment
at Ghent University Hospital,

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:22.814
using sperm from a donor.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.750
In this treatment timeline,

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:28.066
you can see two points
at which we conducted interviews.

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:31.427
We included heterosexual couples,

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.927
where the man for some reason
did not have good-quality sperm,

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:41.553
and lesbian couples who obviously
needed to find sperm elsewhere.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.194
We also included children.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.361
I wanted to know

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:53.018
how those children define concepts
like parenthood and family.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.951
In fact, that is what I asked them,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.698
only not in that way.

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.096
I drew an apple tree instead.

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:08.403
This way, I could ask abstract,
philosophical questions

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:11.700
in a way that did not make them run off.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.984
So as you can see,

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:16.550
the apple tree is empty.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.243
And that illustrates my research approach.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.942
By designing techniques like this,

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:27.739
I can bring as little meaning and content
as possible to the interview,

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.551
because I want to hear that from them.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:33.694
I asked them:

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.828
What would your family look like
if it were an apple tree?

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.489
And they could take a paper apple
for everyone who, in their view,

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.120
was a member of the family,

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:47.318
write a name on it
and hang it wherever they wanted.

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:48.912
And I would ask questions.

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:53.278
Most children started
with a parent or a sibling.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.970
One started with "Boxer,"

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.175
the dead dog of his grandparents.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.688
At this point, none of the children
started mentioning the donor.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:08.803
So, I asked them about their birth story.

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.183
I said, "Before you were born,

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.570
it was just your mom and dad,

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.872
or mom and mommy.

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.478
Can you tell me how you came
into the family?"

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.721
And they explained.

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.808
One said,

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:26.164
"My parents did not have good seeds,

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.887
but there are friendly men out there
who have spare seeds.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.136
They bring them to the hospital,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.374
and they put them in a big jar.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.486
My mommy went there,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.081
and she took two from the jar,

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:42.924
one for me and one for my sister.

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.774
She put the seeds in her belly --

00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:47.353
somehow --

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.543
and her belly grew really big,

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:51.819
and there I was."

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:54.439
Hmm.

00:03:56.123 --> 00:04:00.191
So only when they started
mentioning the donor,

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:03.440
I asked questions about him,
using their own words.

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.325
I said,

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.815
"If this would be an apple
for the friendly man with the seeds,

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.172
what would you do with it?"

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.427
And one boy was thinking out loud,

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:15.819
holding the apple.

00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:17.088
And he said,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.584
"I won't put this one
up there with the others.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.132
He's not part of my family.

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:26.385
But I will not put him on the ground.

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.319
That's too cold and too hard.

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:31.325
I think he should be in the trunk,

00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:34.550
because he made my family possible.

00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:37.218
If he would not have done this,

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:41.200
that would really be sad
because my family would not be here,

00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:42.820
and I would not be here."

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:49.373
So also, parents
constructed family tales --

00:04:49.397 --> 00:04:51.154
tales to tell their children.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.787
One couple explained their insemination

00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.334
by taking their children to a farm

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.852
to watch a vet inseminate cows.

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:05.027
And why not?

00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.491
It's their way of explaining;

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.541
their do-it-yourself
with family narratives.

00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.161
DIY.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:14.901
And we had another couple
who made books --

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:16.380
a book for each child.

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.274
They were really works of art

00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:21.774
containing their thoughts and feelings
throughout the treatment.

00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:24.806
They even had the hospital
parking tickets in there.

00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:27.174
So it is DIY:

00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:29.580
finding ways, words and images

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:32.354
to tell your family story to your child.

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:36.532
And these stories were highly diverse,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.876
but they all had one thing in common:

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:45.134
it was a tale of longing for a child

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:47.563
and a quest for that child.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.437
It was about how special
and how deeply loved their child was.

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:59.790
And research so far shows
that these children are doing fine.

00:05:59.814 --> 00:06:02.408
They do not have
more problems than other kids.

00:06:02.854 --> 00:06:07.275
Yet, these parents also wanted
to justify their decisions

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:08.961
through the tales they tell.

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:12.639
They hoped that their children
would understand their reasons

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:14.498
for making the family in this way.

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:19.819
Underlying was a fear
that their children might disapprove

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:22.085
and would reject the non-genetic parent.

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:25.131
And that fear is understandable,

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:28.196
because we live in a very heteronormative

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.958
and geneticized society --

00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:31.930
a world that still believes

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:36.106
that true families consist
of one mom, one dad

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.467
and their genetically related children.

00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:40.893
Well.

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:45.266
I want to tell you about a teenage boy.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.059
He was donor-conceived
but not part of our study.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.276
One day, he had an argument
with his father,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.592
and he yelled,

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:55.402
"You're telling me what to do?

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:57.307
You're not even my father!"

00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.983
That was exactly what
the parents in our study feared.

00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:07.213
Now, the boy soon felt sorry,
and they made up.

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.400
But it is the reaction of his father
that is most interesting.

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.342
He said,

00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:19.134
"This outburst had nothing to do
with the lack of a genetic link.

00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:22.642
It was about puberty --

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:24.446
being difficult.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.233
It's what they do at that age.

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:28.066
It will pass."

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:31.318
What this man shows us

00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:33.930
is that when something goes wrong,

00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:36.165
we should not immediately think

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.596
it is because the family
is a little different.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.416
These things happen in all families.

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:45.426
And every now and then,

00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:47.495
all parents may wonder:

00:07:48.412 --> 00:07:50.441
Am I a good enough parent?

00:07:51.164 --> 00:07:52.488
These parents, too.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.192
They, above all, wanted to do
what's best for their child.

00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:59.643
But they also sometimes wondered:

00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:01.810
Am I a real parent?

00:08:02.288 --> 00:08:06.257
And their uncertainties were present
long before they even were parents.

00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:07.713
At the start of treatment,

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.452
when they first saw the counselor,

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:12.841
they paid close attention
to the counselor,

00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:14.872
because they wanted to do it right.

00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:17.331
Even 10 years later,

00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:20.672
they still remember
the advice they were given.

00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.882
So when they thought about the counselor

00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:30.653
and the advice they were given,

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.840
we discussed that.

00:08:31.864 --> 00:08:35.428
And we saw one lesbian couple who said,

00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:38.231
"When our son asks us,

00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:40.304
'Do I have a dad?'

00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:44.294
we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.907
But we will say nothing more,
not unless he asks,

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:50.315
because he might not be ready for that.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.839
The counselor said so."

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.520
Well.

00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:56.993
I don't know; that's quite different

00:08:57.017 --> 00:08:59.710
from how we respond
to children's questions.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.274
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?"

00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:06.945
We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"

00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:08.725
and we will talk about the farmer,

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.972
and the way the milk ends up in the shop.

00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:13.353
We will not say,

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:17.710
"No, milk is not made in a factory."

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:22.472
So something strange happened here,

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.854
and of course these children noticed that.

00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:26.856
One boy said,

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:29.837
"I asked my parents loads of questions,

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.670
but they acted really weird.

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:36.732
So, you know, I have a friend at school,
and she's made in the same way.

00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:40.241
When I have a question,
I just go and ask her."

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.968
Clever guy.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.927
Problem solved.

00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:48.349
But his parents did not notice,

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.457
and it certainly was not
what they had in mind,

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:53.415
nor what the counselor had in mind

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:58.636
when they were saying how important
it is to be an open-communication family.

00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:02.716
And that's the strange thing about advice.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.036
When we offer people pills,
we gather evidence first.

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:07.792
We do tests,

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.117
we do follow-up studies.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:13.068
We want to know, and rightly so,
what this pill is doing

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:15.588
and how it affects people's lives.

00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:17.356
And advice?

00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:20.594
It is not enough for advice,

00:10:20.618 --> 00:10:25.441
or for professionals to give advice
that is theoretically sound,

00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:26.766
or well-meant.

00:10:27.447 --> 00:10:30.828
It should be advice
that there is evidence for --

00:10:30.852 --> 00:10:34.753
evidence that it actually
improves patients' lives.

00:10:36.174 --> 00:10:40.737
So the philosopher in me
would now like to offer you a paradox:

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:46.392
I advise you to stop following advice.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.289
But, yes.

00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:53.138
(Applause)

00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:57.154
I will not end here with what went wrong;

00:10:57.178 --> 00:11:01.414
I would not be doing justice
to the warmth we found in those families.

00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:05.561
Remember the books
and the trip to the farmer?

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:09.199
When parents do things that work for them,

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:11.145
they do brilliant things.

00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.034
What I want you to remember
as members of families,

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:18.549
in no matter what form or shape,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:24.277
is that what families need
are warm relationships.

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:28.870
And we do not need to be
professionals to create those.

00:11:29.644 --> 00:11:31.946
Most of us do just fine,

00:11:32.986 --> 00:11:34.695
although it may be hard work,

00:11:35.038 --> 00:11:37.908
and from time to time,
we can do with some advice.

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:40.480
In that case,

00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:42.527
bear in mind three things.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.047
Work with advice
that works for your family.

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:53.486
Remember -- you're the expert,
because you live your family life.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:55.965
And finally,

00:11:56.478 --> 00:12:00.468
believe in your abilities
and your creativity,

00:12:01.027 --> 00:12:04.372
because you can do it yourself.

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:06.413
Thank you.

00:12:06.437 --> 00:12:12.915
(Applause)
