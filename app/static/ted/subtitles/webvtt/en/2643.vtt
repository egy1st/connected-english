WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.176
I was a new mother

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.456
and a young rabbi

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.336
in the spring of 2004

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.600
and the world was in shambles.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.496
Maybe you remember.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.656
Every day, we heard devastating reports
from the war in Iraq.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.536
There were waves of terror
rolling across the globe.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.240
It seemed like humanity
was spinning out of control.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.856
I remember the night that I read

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.016
about the series of coordinated bombings

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.736
in the subway system in Madrid,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.816
and I got up and I walked over to the crib

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.256
where my six-month-old baby girl

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.136
lay sleeping sweetly,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.496
and I heard the rhythm of her breath,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.096
and I felt this sense of urgency
coursing through my body.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.176
We were living through a time
of tectonic shifts in ideologies,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.856
in politics, in religion, in populations.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.960
Everything felt so precarious.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.736
And I remember thinking,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
"My God, what kind of world
did we bring this child into?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.016
And what was I as a mother
and a religious leader

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.560
willing to do about it?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.616
Of course, I knew it was clear

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.536
that religion would be
a principle battlefield

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.016
in this rapidly changing landscape,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.736
and it was already clear

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.480
that religion was a significant
part of the problem.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.376
The question for me was,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
could religion
also be part of the solution?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.096
Now, throughout history,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.336
people have committed
horrible crimes and atrocities

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.000
in the name of religion.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.616
And as we entered the 21st century,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.360
it was very clear that religious extremism
was once again on the rise.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.016
Our studies now show

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.296
that over the course
of the past 15, 20 years,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.456
hostilities and religion-related violence

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.416
have been on the increase
all over the world.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.696
But we don't even need
the studies to prove it,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.896
because I ask you,
how many of us are surprised today

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.696
when we hear the stories
of a bombing or a shooting,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.536
when we later find out
that the last word that was uttered

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.376
before the trigger is pulled
or the bomb is detonated

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.016
is the name of God?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.696
It barely raises an eyebrow today

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.656
when we learn that yet another person

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.216
has decided to show his love of God

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.480
by taking the lives of God's children.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.096
In America, religious extremism

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.656
looks like a white,
antiabortion Christian extremist

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.896
walking into Planned Parenthood
in Colorado Springs

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.776
and murdering three people.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.056
It also looks like a couple

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.896
inspired by the Islamic State

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.536
walking into an office party
in San Bernardino and killing 14.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.376
And even when religion-related extremism
does not lead to violence,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.416
it is still used
as a political wedge issue,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.536
cynically leading people
to justify the subordination of women,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.016
the stigmatization of LGBT people,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.640
racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.416
This ought to concern deeply

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.376
those of us who care
about the future of religion

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.616
and the future of faith.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.016
We need to call this what it is:

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.200
a great failure of religion.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.960
But the thing is, this isn't even the only
challenge that religion faces today.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.776
At the very same time

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.416
that we need religion
to be a strong force against extremism,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.456
it is suffering
from a second pernicious trend,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.280
what I call religious routine-ism.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.416
This is when our institutions
and our leaders

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.216
are stuck in a paradigm
that is rote and perfunctory,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.296
devoid of life, devoid of vision

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.040
and devoid of soul.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.896
Let me explain what I mean like this.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.696
One of the great blessings
of being a rabbi

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.376
is standing under the chuppah,
under the wedding canopy, with a couple,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.656
and helping them proclaim publicly

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.936
and make holy the love
that they found for one another.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.896
I want to ask you now, though,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.816
to think maybe from your own experience

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.256
or maybe just imagine it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.176
about the difference
between the intensity of the experience

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.936
under the wedding canopy,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.176
and maybe the experience
of the sixth or seventh anniversary.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.656
(Laughter)

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.576
And if you're lucky enough
to make it 16 or 17 years,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.576
if you're like most people,
you probably wake up in the morning

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.136
realizing that you forgot to make
a reservation at your favorite restaurant

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.776
and you forgot so much as a card,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.880
and then you just hope and pray
that your partner also forgot.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.576
Well, religious ritual and rites

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.136
were essentially designed
to serve the function of the anniversary,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.176
to be a container in which
we would hold on to the remnants

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.096
of that sacred, revelatory encounter

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.216
that birthed the religion
in the first place.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.736
The problem is that after a few centuries,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.000
the date remains on the calendar,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.536
but the love affair is long dead.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.856
That's when we find ourselves
in endless, mindless repetitions

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.096
of words that don't mean anything to us,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.856
rising and being seated
because someone has asked us to,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.776
holding onto jealously guarded doctrine

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.656
that's completely and wildly out of step
with our contemporary reality,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.216
engaging in perfunctory practice

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.760
simply because that's the way
things have always been done.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.576
Religion is waning in the United States.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.536
Across the board,
churches and synagogues and mosques

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.160
are all complaining

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.976
about how hard it is to maintain relevance

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.136
for a generation of young people
who seem completely uninterested,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.816
not only in the institutions
that stand at the heart of our traditions

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.416
but even in religion itself.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.480
And what they need to understand

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.016
is that there is today
a generation of people

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.896
who are as disgusted by the violence
of religious extremism

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.616
as they are turned off

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.960
by the lifelessness
of religious routine-ism.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.480
Of course there is
a bright spot to this story.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.256
Given the crisis of these two
concurrent trends in religious life,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.976
about 12 or 13 years ago,
I set out to try to determine

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.536
if there was any way

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.736
that I could reclaim the heart
of my own Jewish tradition,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.376
to help make it meaningful
and purposeful again

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.840
in a world on fire.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.936
I started to wonder,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.096
what if we could harness
some of the great minds of our generation

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.096
and think in a bold and robust
and imaginative way again

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.216
about what the next iteration
of religious life would look like?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.296
Now, we had no money,
no space, no game plan,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.776
but we did have email.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.496
So my friend Melissa and I
sat down and we wrote an email

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.376
which we sent out
to a few friends and colleagues.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.216
It basically said this:

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.160
"Before you bail on religion,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.616
why don't we come together
this Friday night

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.760
and see what we might make
of our own Jewish inheritance?"

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.896
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.480
It turned out 135 people came.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.536
They were cynics and seekers,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.296
atheists and rabbis.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.856
Many people said that night
that it was the first time

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.176
that they had a meaningful religious
experience in their entire lives.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.536
And so I set out to do the only
rational thing

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.696
that someone would do
in such a circumstance:

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.656
I quit my job and tried to build
this audacious dream,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.720
a reinvented, rethought religious life

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.736
which we called "IKAR,"

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.936
which means "the essence"
or "the heart of the matter."

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.056
Now, IKAR is not alone

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.616
out there in the religious
landscape today.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.456
There are Jewish and Christian
and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.776
many of them women, by the way,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.816
who have set out to reclaim
the heart of our traditions,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.040
who firmly believe that now is the time
for religion to be part of the solution.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.056
We are going back
into our sacred traditions

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.816
and recognizing that all of our traditions

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.136
contain the raw material
to justify violence and extremism,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.976
and also contain the raw material
to justify compassion,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.416
coexistence and kindness --

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.256
that when others choose to read our texts
as directives for hate and vengeance,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.896
we can choose to read those same texts

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.520
as directives for love
and for forgiveness.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.616
I have found now

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.120
in communities as varied
as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.776
to a woman's mosque,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.456
to black churches
in New York and in North Carolina,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.776
to a holy bus loaded with nuns

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.159
that traverses this country
with a message of justice and peace,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.895
that there is a shared religious ethos

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.576
that is now emerging in the form
of revitalized religion in this country.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.736
And while the theologies
and the practices vary very much

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.456
between these independent communities,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.896
what we can see are some common,
consistent threads between them.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.960
I'm going to share with you
four of those commitments now.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.016
The first is wakefulness.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.936
We live in a time today

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.456
in which we have unprecedented access

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.376
to information about every global tragedy

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.856
that happens on every corner
of this Earth.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.576
Within 12 hours, 20 million people

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.176
saw that image
of Aylan Kurdi's little body

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.576
washed up on the Turkish shore.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.960
We all saw this picture.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.256
We saw this picture
of a five-year-old child

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.720
pulled out of the rubble
of his building in Aleppo.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.536
And once we see these images,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.200
we are called to a certain kind of action.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.936
My tradition tells a story
of a traveler who is walking down a road

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.496
when he sees a beautiful house on fire,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.056
and he says, "How can it be
that something so beautiful would burn,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.616
and nobody seems to even care?"

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.736
So too we learn that our world is on fire,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.496
and it is our job to keep our hearts
and our eyes open,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.056
and to recognize
that it's our responsibility

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.656
to help put out the flames.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.736
This is extremely difficult to do.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.536
Psychologists tell us that the more
we learn about what's broken in our world,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.896
the less likely we are to do anything.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.496
It's called psychic numbing.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.080
We just shut down at a certain point.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.576
Well, somewhere along the way,
our religious leaders forgot

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.896
that it's our job
to make people uncomfortable.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.976
It's our job to wake people up,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.136
to pull them out of their apathy

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.616
and into the anguish,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.096
and to insist that we do
what we don't want to do

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.456
and see what we do not want to see.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.856
Because we know
that social change only happens --

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.936
(Applause)

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.840
when we are awake enough
to see that the house is on fire.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.696
The second principle is hope,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.340
and I want to say this about hope.

00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:43.496
Hope is not naive,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.456
and hope is not an opiate.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.536
Hope may be the single
greatest act of defiance

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.896
against a politics of pessimism

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.336
and against a culture of despair.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.256
Because what hope does for us

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.056
is it lifts us out of the container

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.776
that holds us and constrains us
from the outside,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.536
and says, "You can dream
and think expansively again.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.960
That they cannot control in you."

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.776
I saw hope made manifest
in an African-American church

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.336
in the South Side of Chicago this summer,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.016
where I brought my little girl,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.256
who is now 13

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.976
and a few inches taller than me,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.800
to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.056
That summer, there had already been
3,000 people shot

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.400
between January and July in Chicago.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.136
We went into that church
and heard Rev. Moss preach,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.096
and after he did,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.376
this choir of gorgeous women,
100 women strong,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.360
stood up and began to sing.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.336
"I need you. You need me.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.040
I love you. I need you to survive."

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.416
And I realized in that moment

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.016
that this is what religion
is supposed to be about.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.736
It's supposed to be about
giving people back a sense of purpose,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.256
a sense of hope,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.216
a sense that they and their dreams
fundamentally matter in this world

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.800
that tells them
that they don't matter at all.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.536
The third principle
is the principle of mightiness.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.216
There's a rabbinic tradition
that we are to walk around

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.536
with two slips of paper in our pockets.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.976
One says, "I am but dust and ashes."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.696
It's not all about me.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.240
I can't control everything,
and I cannot do this on my own.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.136
The other slip of paper says,
"For my sake the world was created."

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.280
Which is to say it's true
that I can't do everything,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.240
but I can surely do something.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.816
I can forgive.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.040
I can love.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.056
I can show up.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.696
I can protest.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.896
I can be a part of this conversation.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.776
We even now have a religious ritual,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.016
a posture,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.736
that holds the paradox
between powerlessness and power.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.976
In the Jewish community,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.296
the only time of year
that we prostrate fully to the ground

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.976
is during the high holy days.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.240
It's a sign of total submission.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.896
Now in our community,
when we get up off the ground,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.416
we stand with our hands
raised to the heavens,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.056
and we say, "I am strong,
I am mighty, and I am worthy.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.440
I can't do everything,
but I can do something."

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.616
In a world that conspires
to make us believe that we are invisible

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.176
and that we are impotent,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.936
religious communities and religious ritual

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.576
can remind us that for whatever
amount of time we have here on this Earth,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.056
whatever gifts and blessings
we were given,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.816
whatever resources we have,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.176
we can and we must use them

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.776
to try to make the world
a little bit more just

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.181
and a little bit more loving.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.856
The fourth and final
is interconnectedness.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.136
A few years ago, there was a man
walking on the beach in Alaska,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.096
when he came across a soccer ball

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.616
that had some Japanese
letters written on it.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.976
He took a picture of it
and posted it up on social media,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.696
and a Japanese teenager contacted him.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.496
He had lost everything in the tsunami
that devastated his country,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.216
but he was able
to retrieve that soccer ball

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.256
after it had floated
all the way across the Pacific.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.056
How small our world has become.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.896
It's so hard for us to remember
how interconnected we all are

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.120
as human beings.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.696
And yet, we know

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.416
that it is systems of oppression

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.536
that benefit the most
from the lie of radical individualism.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.376
Let me tell you how this works.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.336
I'm not supposed to care

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.816
when black youth are harassed by police,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.136
because my white-looking Jewish kids

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.056
probably won't ever get pulled over
for the crime of driving while black.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.096
Well, not so, because
this is also my problem.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.296
And guess what?
Transphobia and Islamophobia

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.856
and racism of all forms,
those are also all of our problems.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.336
And so too is anti-Semitism
all of our problems.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.056
Because Emma Lazarus was right.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.400
(Applause)

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.896
Emma Lazarus was right
when she said until all of us are free,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.856
we are none of us free.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.960
We are all in this together.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.296
And now somewhere at the intersection
of these four trends,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.056
of wakefulness and hope
and mightiness and interconnectedness,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.616
there is a burgeoning, multifaith
justice movement in this country

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.896
that is staking a claim on a countertrend,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:36.056
saying that religion can and must be
a force for good in the world.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.096
Our hearts hurt from
the failed religion of extremism,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.336
and we deserve more
than the failed religion of routine-ism.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.136
It is time for religious leaders
and religious communities

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.536
to take the lead in the spiritual
and cultural shift

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.256
that this country and the world
so desperately needs --

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.416
a shift toward love,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.336
toward justice, toward equality
and toward dignity for all.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.800
I believe that our children
deserve no less than that.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.576
Thank you.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:14.124
(Applause)
