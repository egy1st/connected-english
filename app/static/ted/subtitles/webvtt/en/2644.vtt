00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.040
Science.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.176
The very word for many of you conjures
unhappy memories of boredom

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.096
in high school biology or physics class.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.216
But let me assure that what you did there

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.416
had very little to do with science.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.736
That was really the "what" of science.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.480
It was the history
of what other people had discovered.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.056
What I'm most interested in as a scientist

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.216
is the "how" of science.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.056
Because science is knowledge in process.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.536
We make an observation,
guess an explanation for that observation,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.616
and then make a prediction
that we can test

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.560
with an experiment or other observation.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.416
A couple of examples.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.016
First of all, people noticed
that the Earth was below, the sky above,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.920
and both the Sun and the Moon
seemed to go around them.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.256
Their guessed explanation

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360
was that the Earth must be
the center of the universe.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.440
The prediction: everything
should circle around the Earth.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.776
This was first really tested

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.616
when Galileo got his hands
on one of the first telescopes,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.016
and as he gazed into the night sky,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.736
what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.760
with four moons circling around it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.136
He then used those moons
to follow the path of Jupiter

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.896
and found that Jupiter
also was not going around the Earth

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.880
but around the Sun.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.440
So the prediction test failed.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.496
And this led to
the discarding of the theory

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.696
that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.816
Another example: Sir Isaac Newton
noticed that things fall to the Earth.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.760
The guessed explanation was gravity,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.656
the prediction that everything
should fall to the Earth.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.240
But of course, not everything
does fall to the Earth.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.760
So did we discard gravity?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.336
No. We revised the theory and said,
gravity pulls things to the Earth

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
unless there is an equal
and opposite force in the other direction.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
This led us to learn something new.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.176
We began to pay more attention
to the bird and the bird's wings,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.576
and just think of all the discoveries

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.639
that have flown
from that line of thinking.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.776
So the test failures,
the exceptions, the outliers

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.360
teach us what we don't know
and lead us to something new.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.200
This is how science moves forward.
This is how science learns.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.096
Sometimes in the media,
and even more rarely,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.536
but sometimes even scientists will say

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.320
that something or other
has been scientifically proven.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.456
But I hope that you understand
that science never proves anything

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360
definitively forever.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.336
Hopefully science remains curious enough

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.776
to look for

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.776
and humble enough to recognize

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.296
when we have found

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.016
the next outlier,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.536
the next exception,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.856
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.480
teaches us what we don't actually know.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.696
We're going to change gears
here for a second.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.656
The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.136
means a lot of different things
to different people,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.416
but most of our
public discourse on medicine

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.216
really turns it into
an engineering problem.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.976
We have the hallways of Congress,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the boardrooms of insurance companies
that try to figure out how to pay for it.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.296
The ethicists and epidemiologists

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.016
try to figure out
how best to distribute medicine,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.696
and the hospitals and physicians
are absolutely obsessed

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.656
with their protocols and checklists,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.216
trying to figure out
how best to safely apply medicine.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.360
These are all good things.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.696
However, they also all assume

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.696
at some level

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.240
that the textbook of medicine is closed.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.656
We start to measure
the quality of our health care

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.216
by how quickly we can access it.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.336
It doesn't surprise me
that in this climate,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.176
many of our institutions
for the provision of health care

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.696
start to look a heck of a lot
like Jiffy Lube.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.296
(Laughter)

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.256
The only problem is that
when I graduated from medical school,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.336
I didn't get one of those
little doohickeys

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.736
that your mechanic
has to plug into your car

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.136
and find out exactly what's wrong with it,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.256
because the textbook of medicine

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800
is not closed.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.160
Medicine is science.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.240
Medicine is knowledge in process.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.656
We make an observation,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.815
we guess an explanation
of that observation,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.456
and then we make a prediction
that we can test.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.056
Now, the testing ground
of most predictions in medicine

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.616
is populations.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.216
And you may remember
from those boring days in biology class

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.416
that populations tend to distribute

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.656
around a mean

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.536
as a Gaussian or a normal curve.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.216
Therefore, in medicine,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.456
after we make a prediction
from a guessed explanation,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.360
we test it in a population.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.256
That means that what we know in medicine,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.536
our knowledge and our know-how,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.816
comes from populations

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.616
but extends only as far

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.376
as the next outlier,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.616
the next exception,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.376
which, like Jupiter's moons,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.800
will teach us what we don't actually know.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.416
Now, I am a surgeon

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.856
who looks after patients with sarcoma.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.080
Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.760
It's the cancer of flesh and bones.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.576
And I would tell you that every one
of my patients is an outlier,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.800
is an exception.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.216
There is no surgery I have ever performed
for a sarcoma patient

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.496
that has ever been guided
by a randomized controlled clinical trial,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.240
what we consider the best kind
of population-based evidence in medicine.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.696
People talk about thinking
outside the box,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.456
but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.816
What we do have as we take
a bath in the uncertainty

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.976
and unknowns and exceptions
and outliers that surround us in sarcoma

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.536
is easy access to what I think
are those two most important values

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.096
for any science:

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.320
humility and curiosity.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.296
Because if I am humble and curious,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.616
when a patient asks me a question,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.080
and I don't know the answer,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.136
I'll ask a colleague

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.176
who may have a similar
albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.896
We'll even establish
international collaborations.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.056
Those patients will start
to talk to each other through chat rooms

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.280
and support groups.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.376
It's through this kind
of humbly curious communication

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.960
that we begin to try and learn new things.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.296
As an example, this is a patient of mine

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
who had a cancer near his knee.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.856
Because of humbly curious communication

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.976
in international collaborations,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.536
we have learned that we can repurpose
the ankle to serve as the knee

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.816
when we have to remove the knee
with the cancer.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.680
He can then wear a prosthetic
and run and jump and play.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.376
This opportunity was available to him

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.176
because of international collaborations.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.896
It was desirable to him

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.880
because he had contacted other patients
who had experienced it.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.976
And so exceptions and outliers in medicine

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.960
teach us what we don't know,
but also lead us to new thinking.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.936
Now, very importantly,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.816
all the new thinking that outliers
and exceptions lead us to in medicine

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.200
does not only apply
to the outliers and exceptions.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.096
It is not that we only learn
from sarcoma patients

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.080
ways to manage sarcoma patients.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.976
Sometimes, the outliers

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.696
and the exceptions

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.960
teach us things that matter quite a lot
to the general population.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.216
Like a tree standing outside a forest,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.256
the outliers and the exceptions
draw our attention

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.616
and lead us into a much greater sense
of perhaps what a tree is.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.136
We often talk about
losing the forests for the trees,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.976
but one also loses a tree

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.520
within a forest.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.856
But the tree that stands out by itself

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.776
makes those relationships
that define a tree,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.616
the relationships between trunk
and roots and branches,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.880
much more apparent.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.056
Even if that tree is crooked

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.056
or even if that tree
has very unusual relationships

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.376
between trunk and roots and branches,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.096
it nonetheless draws our attention

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.016
and allows us to make observations

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.280
that we can then test
in the general population.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.976
I told you that sarcomas are rare.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.640
They make up about one percent
of all cancers.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.240
You also probably know that cancer
is considered a genetic disease.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.176
By genetic disease we mean
that cancer is caused by oncogenes

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.576
that are turned on in cancer

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.640
and tumor suppressor genes
that are turned off to cause cancer.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.576
You might think
that we learned about oncogenes

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.816
and tumor suppressor genes
from common cancers

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.816
like breast cancer and prostate cancer

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.336
and lung cancer,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.559
but you'd be wrong.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.895
We learned about oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.135
for the first time

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.600
in that itty-bitty little one percent
of cancers called sarcoma.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.336
In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.376
for realizing that chickens

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.520
had a transmissible form of sarcoma.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.096
Thirty years later, Harold Varmus
and Mike Bishop discovered

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.656
what that transmissible element was.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.256
It was a virus

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.696
carrying a gene,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.160
the src oncogene.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.536
Now, I will not tell you
that src is the most important oncogene.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.776
I will not tell you

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.296
that src is the most frequently
turned on oncogene in all of cancer.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.760
But it was the first oncogene.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.296
The exception, the outlier

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.840
drew our attention and led us to something

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.560
that taught us very important things
about the rest of biology.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.976
Now, TP53 is the most important
tumor suppressor gene.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.736
It is the most frequently turned off
tumor suppressor gene

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.560
in almost every kind of cancer.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.656
But we didn't learn about it
from common cancers.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.096
We learned about it
when doctors Li and Fraumeni

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.696
were looking at families,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.736
and they realized that these families

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.280
had way too many sarcomas.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.696
I told you that sarcoma is rare.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.896
Remember that a one
in a million diagnosis,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.056
if it happens twice in one family,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.480
is way too common in that family.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.336
The very fact that these are rare

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.800
draws our attention

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.000
and leads us to new kinds of thinking.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.936
Now, many of you may say,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.496
and may rightly say,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.416
that yeah, Kevin, that's great,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.496
but you're not talking
about a bird's wing.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.000
You're not talking about moons
floating around some planet Jupiter.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.056
This is a person.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.336
This outlier, this exception,
may lead to the advancement of science,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.560
but this is a person.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.896
And all I can say

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.280
is that I know that all too well.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.160
I have conversations with these patients
with rare and deadly diseases.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.736
I write about these conversations.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.056
These conversations are terribly fraught.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.896
They're fraught with horrible phrases

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.160
like "I have bad news"
or "There's nothing more we can do."

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.960
Sometimes these conversations
turn on a single word:

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.960
"terminal."

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.840
Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.936
Where the blanks are in medicine

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.816
can be just as important

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.080
as the words that we use
in these conversations.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.616
What are the unknowns?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.840
What are the experiments
that are being done?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.376
Do this little exercise with me.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.616
Up there on the screen,
you see this phrase, "no where."

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.920
Notice where the blank is.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.880
If we move that blank one space over

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.216
"no where"

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.936
becomes "now here,"

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.856
the exact opposite meaning,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.080
just by shifting the blank one space over.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.256
I'll never forget the night

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.520
that I walked into
one of my patients' rooms.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.936
I had been operating long that day

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.976
but I still wanted to come and see him.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.200
He was a boy I had diagnosed
with a bone cancer a few days before.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.896
He and his mother had been meeting
with the chemotherapy doctors

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.136
earlier that day,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.136
and he had been admitted
to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.336
It was almost midnight
when I got to his room.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.536
He was asleep, but I found his mother

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.136
reading by flashlight

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.616
next to his bed.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.440
She came out in the hall
to chat with me for a few minutes.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.376
It turned out that
what she had been reading

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.576
was the protocol
that the chemotherapy doctors

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.840
had given her that day.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.440
She had memorized it.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.736
She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.936
that we don't always win

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240
with this type of cancer,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.160
but I've been studying this protocol,
and I think I can do it.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.536
I think I can comply
with these very difficult treatments.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.536
I'm going to quit my job.
I'm going to move in with my parents.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.520
I'm going to keep my baby safe."

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.520
I didn't tell her.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.760
I didn't stop to correct her thinking.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.936
She was trusting in a protocol

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.176
that even if complied with,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.600
wouldn't necessarily save her son.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.160
I didn't tell her.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.760
I didn't fill in that blank.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.056
But a year and a half later

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.800
her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.720
Should I have told her?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.616
Now, many of you may say, "So what?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.896
I don't have sarcoma.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.816
No one in my family has sarcoma.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.296
And this is all fine and well,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.016
but it probably doesn't
matter in my life."

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.296
And you're probably right.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.000
Sarcoma may not matter
a whole lot in your life.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.376
But where the blanks are in medicine

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.720
does matter in your life.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.816
I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.216
I told you that in medicine,
we test predictions in populations,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.496
but I didn't tell you,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.736
and so often medicine never tells you

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.616
that every time an individual

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.736
encounters medicine,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.800
even if that individual is firmly
embedded in the general population,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.736
neither the individual
nor the physician knows

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.440
where in that population
the individual will land.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.736
Therefore, every encounter with medicine

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.200
is an experiment.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.936
You will be a subject

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.640
in an experiment.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.400
And the outcome will be either
a better or a worse result for you.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.336
As long as medicine works well,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.376
we're fine with fast service,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.840
bravado, brimmingly
confident conversations.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.376
But when things don't work well,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.240
sometimes we want something different.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.800
A colleague of mine
removed a tumor from a patient's limb.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.736
He was concerned about this tumor.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.776
In our physician conferences,
he talked about his concern

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.216
that this was a type of tumor

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.800
that had a high risk
for coming back in the same limb.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.656
But his conversations with the patient

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.776
were exactly what a patient might want:

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.056
brimming with confidence.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.096
He said, "I got it all
and you're good to go."

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.856
She and her husband were thrilled.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.960
They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,
opened a bottle of champagne.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.336
The only problem was a few weeks later,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.456
she started to notice
another nodule in the same area.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.616
It turned out he hadn't gotten it all,
and she wasn't good to go.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.480
But what happened at this juncture
absolutely fascinates me.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.816
My colleague came to me and said,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.560
"Kevin, would you mind
looking after this patient for me?"

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.456
I said, "Why, you know the right thing
to do as well as I do.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.096
You haven't done anything wrong."

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.600
He said, "Please, just look
after this patient for me."

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.736
He was embarrassed --

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.160
not by what he had done,

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.080
but by the conversation that he had had,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.200
by the overconfidence.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.216
So I performed
a much more invasive surgery

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.376
and had a very different conversation
with the patient afterwards.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.736
I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.176
and you're most likely good to go,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.360
but this is the experiment
that we're doing.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.056
This is what you're going to watch for.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.976
This is what I'm going to watch for.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.936
And we're going to work together
to find out if this surgery will work

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.280
to get rid of your cancer."

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.856
I can guarantee you, she and her husband

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.800
did not crack another bottle of champagne
after talking to me.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.456
But she was now a scientist,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.840
not only a subject in her experiment.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.576
And so I encourage you

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.056
to seek humility and curiosity

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.280
in your physicians.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.736
Almost 20 billion times each year,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.696
a person walks into a doctor's office,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.000
and that person becomes a patient.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.840
You or someone you love
will be that patient sometime very soon.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.480
How will you talk to your doctors?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.840
What will you tell them?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.280
What will they tell you?

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.816
They cannot tell you

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.360
what they do not know,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.120
but they can tell you when they don't know

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.640
if only you'll ask.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.000
So please, join the conversation.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.416
Thank you.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.308
(Applause)
