00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:06.783
I'm going to talk a little bit
about where technology's going.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.180
And often technology comes to us,

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.431
we're surprised by what it brings.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:16.138
But there's actually
a large aspect of technology

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.964
that's much more predictable,

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:22.076
and that's because technological systems
of all sorts have leanings,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.275
they have urgencies,

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.860
they have tendencies.

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:29.816
And those tendencies are derived
from the very nature of the physics,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.990
chemistry of wires
and switches and electrons,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.261
and they will make reoccurring
patterns again and again.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:42.619
And so those patterns produce
these tendencies, these leanings.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.474
You can almost think of it
as sort of like gravity.

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.817
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.929
The actual path of a raindrop
as it goes down the valley

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:52.122
is unpredictable.

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.169
We cannot see where it's going,

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:56.470
but the general direction
is very inevitable:

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:57.728
it's downward.

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:02.949
And so these baked-in
tendencies and urgencies

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:04.449
in technological systems

00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.660
give us a sense of where things
are going at the large form.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.550
So in a large sense,

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:13.935
I would say that telephones
were inevitable,

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.347
but the iPhone was not.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:18.572
The Internet was inevitable,

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:20.560
but Twitter was not.

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:24.964
So we have many ongoing
tendencies right now,

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.708
and I think one of the chief among them

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:31.454
is this tendency to make things
smarter and smarter.

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.253
I call it cognifying -- cognification --

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:37.565
also known as artificial
intelligence, or AI.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:41.771
And I think that's going to be one
of the most influential developments

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:47.370
and trends and directions and drives
in our society in the next 20 years.

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:50.006
So, of course, it's already here.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.234
We already have AI,

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.656
and often it works in the background,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.266
in the back offices of hospitals,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.976
where it's used to diagnose X-rays
better than a human doctor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.726
It's in legal offices,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.118
where it's used to go
through legal evidence

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:06.997
better than a human paralawyer.

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:11.162
It's used to fly the plane
that you came here with.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.546
Human pilots only flew it
seven to eight minutes,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.523
the rest of the time the AI was driving.

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.720
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.274
it's in the background,
making those recommendations.

00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:22.559
That's what we have today.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:27.384
And we have an example, of course,
in a more front-facing aspect of it,

00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:34.037
with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat
the world's greatest Go champion.

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:38.531
But it's more than that.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:41.197
If you play a video game,
you're playing against an AI.

00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.759
But recently, Google taught their AI

00:02:45.783 --> 00:02:48.195
to actually learn how to play video games.

00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:51.395
Again, teaching video games
was already done,

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.316
but learning how to play
a video game is another step.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.018
That's artificial smartness.

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:03.093
What we're doing is taking
this artificial smartness

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.540
and we're making it smarter and smarter.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.605
There are three aspects
to this general trend

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.318
that I think are underappreciated;

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.619
I think we would understand
AI a lot better

00:03:14.643 --> 00:03:16.944
if we understood these three things.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:20.251
I think these things also would
help us embrace AI,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:23.283
because it's only by embracing it
that we actually can steer it.

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.044
We can actually steer the specifics
by embracing the larger trend.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.446
So let me talk about
those three different aspects.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.143
The first one is: our own intelligence
has a very poor understanding

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.657
of what intelligence is.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.763
We tend to think of intelligence
as a single dimension,

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.537
that it's kind of like a note
that gets louder and louder.

00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:45.168
It starts like with IQ measurement.

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:49.284
It starts with maybe a simple
low IQ in a rat or mouse,

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:51.442
and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,

00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:54.078
and then maybe there's more
in a stupid person,

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.198
and then maybe an average
person like myself,

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:57.512
and then maybe a genius.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:01.969
And this single IQ intelligence
is getting greater and greater.

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:03.667
That's completely wrong.

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:07.299
That's not what intelligence is --
not what human intelligence is, anyway.

00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:12.179
It's much more like a symphony
of different notes,

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.812
and each of these notes is played
on a different instrument of cognition.

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:19.537
There are many types
of intelligences in our own minds.

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:22.609
We have deductive reasoning,

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.854
we have emotional intelligence,

00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:26.271
we have spatial intelligence;

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:30.316
we have maybe 100 different types
that are all grouped together,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.245
and they vary in different strengths
with different people.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:38.795
And of course, if we go to animals,
they also have another basket --

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.360
another symphony of different
kinds of intelligences,

00:04:41.384 --> 00:04:44.950
and sometimes those same instruments
are the same that we have.

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:48.535
They can think in the same way,
but they may have a different arrangement,

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.026
and maybe they're higher
in some cases than humans,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.887
like long-term memory in a squirrel
is actually phenomenal,

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.198
so it can remember
where it buried its nuts.

00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:58.209
But in other cases they may be lower.

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:00.963
When we go to make machines,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:03.183
we're going to engineer
them in the same way,

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:08.217
where we'll make some of those types
of smartness much greater than ours,

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.812
and many of them won't be
anywhere near ours,

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:12.380
because they're not needed.

00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:14.607
So we're going to take these things,

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:16.712
these artificial clusters,

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:22.098
and we'll be adding more varieties
of artificial cognition to our AIs.

00:05:22.507 --> 00:05:26.578
We're going to make them
very, very specific.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:33.144
So your calculator is smarter
than you are in arithmetic already;

00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:36.865
your GPS is smarter
than you are in spatial navigation;

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.595
Google, Bing, are smarter
than you are in long-term memory.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.869
And we're going to take, again,
these kinds of different types of thinking

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:48.826
and we'll put them into, like, a car.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.907
The reason why we want to put them
in a car so the car drives,

00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.233
is because it's not driving like a human.

00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:55.653
It's not thinking like us.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:57.597
That's the whole feature of it.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:59.156
It's not being distracted,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.934
it's not worrying about whether
it left the stove on,

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.096
or whether it should have
majored in finance.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.273
It's just driving.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:06.439
(Laughter)

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:08.304
Just driving, OK?

00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:11.265
And we actually might even
come to advertise these

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.834
as "consciousness-free."

00:06:12.858 --> 00:06:14.632
They're without consciousness,

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:16.760
they're not concerned about those things,

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:17.940
they're not distracted.

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:20.930
So in general, what we're trying to do

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:25.454
is make as many different
types of thinking as we can.

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.887
We're going to populate the space

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:32.070
of all the different possible types,
or species, of thinking.

00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:34.162
And there actually may be some problems

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.986
that are so difficult
in business and science

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.052
that our own type of human thinking
may not be able to solve them alone.

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.068
We may need a two-step program,

00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:47.295
which is to invent new kinds of thinking

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:51.426
that we can work alongside of to solve
these really large problems,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.368
say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:59.142
What we're doing
is making alien intelligences.

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:03.235
You might even think of this
as, sort of, artificial aliens

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:04.466
in some senses.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.790
And they're going to help
us think different,

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:10.446
because thinking different
is the engine of creation

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.337
and wealth and new economy.

00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:18.758
The second aspect of this
is that we are going to use AI

00:07:18.782 --> 00:07:21.732
to basically make a second
Industrial Revolution.

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:24.908
The first Industrial Revolution
was based on the fact

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:28.394
that we invented something
I would call artificial power.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.029
Previous to that,

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:32.087
during the Agricultural Revolution,

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:35.813
everything that was made
had to be made with human muscle

00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:37.144
or animal power.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:39.628
That was the only way
to get anything done.

00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:42.597
The great innovation during
the Industrial Revolution was,

00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.730
we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:49.610
to make this artificial power
that we could use

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.303
to do anything we wanted to do.

00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:54.099
So today when you drive down the highway,

00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:59.096
you are, with a flick of the switch,
commanding 250 horses --

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.692
250 horsepower --

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:05.408
which we can use to build skyscrapers,
to build cities, to build roads,

00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:11.221
to make factories that would churn out
lines of chairs or refrigerators

00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:12.899
way beyond our own power.

00:08:12.923 --> 00:08:19.034
And that artificial power can also
be distributed on wires on a grid

00:08:19.058 --> 00:08:22.257
to every home, factory, farmstead,

00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.472
and anybody could buy
that artificial power,

00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:27.968
just by plugging something in.

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:30.431
So this was a source
of innovation as well,

00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:33.873
because a farmer could take
a manual hand pump,

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:36.813
and they could add this artificial
power, this electricity,

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:38.334
and he'd have an electric pump.

00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:41.676
And you multiply that by thousands
or tens of thousands of times,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.859
and that formula was what brought us
the Industrial Revolution.

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:48.468
All the things that we see,
all this progress that we now enjoy,

00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:50.555
has come from the fact
that we've done that.

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.927
We're going to do
the same thing now with AI.

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:55.026
We're going to distribute that on a grid,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.424
and now you can take that electric pump.

00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:00.416
You can add some artificial intelligence,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.921
and now you have a smart pump.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.873
And that, multiplied by a million times,

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.260
is going to be this second
Industrial Revolution.

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:08.666
So now the car is going down the highway,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.984
it's 250 horsepower,
but in addition, it's 250 minds.

00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:14.777
That's the auto-driven car.

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:16.190
It's like a new commodity;

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:17.517
it's a new utility.

00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:20.582
The AI is going to flow
across the grid -- the cloud --

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:22.173
in the same way electricity did.

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:24.577
So everything that we had electrified,

00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:26.324
we're now going to cognify.

00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:28.078
And I would suggest, then,

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:31.834
that the formula
for the next 10,000 start-ups

00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:33.020
is very, very simple,

00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:36.211
which is to take x and add AI.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.912
That is the formula,
that's what we're going to be doing.

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:43.242
And that is the way
in which we're going to make

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.124
this second Industrial Revolution.

00:09:45.148 --> 00:09:47.302
And by the way -- right now, this minute,

00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:48.495
you can log on to Google

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:52.401
and you can purchase
AI for six cents, 100 hits.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.362
That's available right now.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.672
So the third aspect of this

00:09:57.315 --> 00:09:59.993
is that when we take this AI
and embody it,

00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:01.190
we get robots.

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:02.917
And robots are going to be bots,

00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:06.269
they're going to be doing many
of the tasks that we have already done.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:09.885
A job is just a bunch of tasks,

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.671
so they're going to redefine our jobs

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.954
because they're going to do
some of those tasks.

00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:17.175
But they're also going to create
whole new categories,

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.446
a whole new slew of tasks

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.927
that we didn't know
we wanted to do before.

00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:25.588
They're going to actually
engender new kinds of jobs,

00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:27.883
new kinds of tasks that we want done,

00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:31.312
just as automation made up
a whole bunch of new things

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:33.170
that we didn't know we needed before,

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:35.150
and now we can't live without them.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:39.130
So they're going to produce
even more jobs than they take away,

00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:42.588
but it's important that a lot of the tasks
that we're going to give them

00:10:42.612 --> 00:10:47.184
are tasks that can be defined
in terms of efficiency or productivity.

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.504
If you can specify a task,

00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:51.763
either manual or conceptual,

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:56.567
that can be specified in terms
of efficiency or productivity,

00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:58.368
that goes to the bots.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.936
Productivity is for robots.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.030
What we're really good at
is basically wasting time.

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.082
(Laughter)

00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:07.422
We're really good at things
that are inefficient.

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:10.471
Science is inherently inefficient.

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:13.722
It runs on that fact that you have
one failure after another.

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:17.170
It runs on the fact that you make tests
and experiments that don't work,

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:18.636
otherwise you're not learning.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.822
It runs on the fact

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.929
that there is not
a lot of efficiency in it.

00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:24.732
Innovation by definition is inefficient,

00:11:24.756 --> 00:11:26.147
because you make prototypes,

00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:28.878
because you try stuff that fails,
that doesn't work.

00:11:28.902 --> 00:11:32.014
Exploration is inherently inefficiency.

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:33.569
Art is not efficient.

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:35.720
Human relationships are not efficient.

00:11:35.744 --> 00:11:38.684
These are all the kinds of things
we're going to gravitate to,

00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:40.183
because they're not efficient.

00:11:40.207 --> 00:11:42.522
Efficiency is for robots.

00:11:43.338 --> 00:11:47.461
We're also going to learn
that we're going to work with these AIs

00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:49.482
because they think differently than us.

00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:54.319
When Deep Blue beat
the world's best chess champion,

00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:56.272
people thought it was the end of chess.

00:11:56.296 --> 00:12:00.698
But actually, it turns out that today,
the best chess champion in the world

00:12:00.722 --> 00:12:02.279
is not an AI.

00:12:02.906 --> 00:12:04.087
And it's not a human.

00:12:04.111 --> 00:12:06.826
It's the team of a human and an AI.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.850
The best medical diagnostician
is not a doctor, it's not an AI,

00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:12.050
it's the team.

00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:14.223
We're going to be working with these AIs,

00:12:14.247 --> 00:12:16.242
and I think you'll be paid in the future

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:18.657
by how well you work with these bots.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:23.283
So that's the third thing,
is that they're different,

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:24.472
they're utility

00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:28.312
and they are going to be something
we work with rather than against.

00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:30.975
We're working with these
rather than against them.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.476
So, the future:

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.920
Where does that take us?

00:12:33.944 --> 00:12:37.511
I think that 25 years from now,
they'll look back

00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:40.660
and look at our understanding
of AI and say,

00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:43.984
"You didn't have AI. In fact,
you didn't even have the Internet yet,

00:12:44.008 --> 00:12:46.749
compared to what we're going
to have 25 years from now."

00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:50.896
There are no AI experts right now.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.619
There's a lot of money going to it,

00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.911
there are billions of dollars
being spent on it;

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:57.099
it's a huge business,

00:12:57.123 --> 00:13:01.395
but there are no experts, compared
to what we'll know 20 years from now.

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:04.949
So we are just at the beginning
of the beginning,

00:13:04.973 --> 00:13:07.136
we're in the first hour of all this.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.095
We're in the first hour of the Internet.

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:11.159
We're in the first hour of what's coming.

00:13:11.183 --> 00:13:15.336
The most popular AI product
in 20 years from now,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.804
that everybody uses,

00:13:17.499 --> 00:13:19.043
has not been invented yet.

00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:22.931
That means that you're not late.

00:13:23.684 --> 00:13:24.835
Thank you.

00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:25.885
(Laughter)

00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:28.666
(Applause)
