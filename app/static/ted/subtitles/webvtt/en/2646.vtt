00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:05.063
So, my journey began
in the Bronx, New York,

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:07.866
in a one-bedroom apartment,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.561
with my two sisters and immigrant mother.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.519
I loved our neighborhood.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.890
It was lively.

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.359
There was all this merengue blasting,

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.772
neighbors socializing on building stoops

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:25.219
and animated conversations
over domino playing.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:27.789
It was home,

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:30.344
and it was sweet.

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:32.964
But it wasn't simple.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.259
In fact, everyone at school
knew the block where we lived,

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:41.398
because it was where people came
to buy weed and other drugs.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.520
And with drug-dealing comes conflict,

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:48.413
so we often went to sleep
to the sound of gunshots.

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.692
I spent much of my childhood worried,

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.549
worried about our safety.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:58.201
And so did our mother.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:03.871
She worried that the violence we witnessed
would overtake our lives;

00:01:04.338 --> 00:01:06.063
that our poverty meant

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:08.762
that the neighbors with whom
we lived and shared space

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:10.071
would harm us.

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.881
Our entire life was in the Bronx,

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.562
but my mother's anxiety
spurred her into action,

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:22.356
and soon we were driving
so fast to Connecticut --

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.452
(Laughter)

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:27.833
to boarding school campuses,
with full scholarships in tow.

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:33.591
Man, don't underestimate
the power of a mother

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:36.167
determined to keep her children safe.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.292
(Cheers)

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:40.735
(Applause)

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.004
At boarding school,

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:48.795
for the first time,

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.184
I was able to sleep without worry.

00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.396
I could leave my dorm room unlocked,

00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.803
walk barefoot in the grass,

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:02.410
and look up to see
a night sky full of stars.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:05.992
Happy novelties.

00:02:07.172 --> 00:02:09.512
But there were other novelties as well.

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:13.825
Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.358
I learned that I didn't speak
the right way,

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:20.682
and to demonstrate
the proper ways of speaking,

00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:25.287
my teachers gave me
frequent lessons, in public,

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.291
on the appropriate way
to enunciate certain words.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.889
A teacher once instructed me
in the hallway:

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.701
"Aaaaaas-king."

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.135
She said this loudly.

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:46.946
"Dena, it's not 'axing,'
like you're running around with an axe.

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:49.217
That's silly."

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:55.016
Now at this point, you can imagine
the snickers of my classmates,

00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:57.779
but she continued:

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:04.174
"Think about breaking the word
into 'ass' and 'king,'

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:07.725
and then put the two together
to say it correctly --

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.006
'Asking.'"

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:15.321
There were some other moments
that reminded me that I didn't belong.

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:19.291
Once, I walked into
a classmate's dorm room,

00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:23.138
and I watched her watch
her valuables around me.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.242
Like, why would she do that?
I thought to myself.

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.824
And then there was the time

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:34.287
when another classmate
walked into my dorm room,

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:38.341
and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying
hair grease to my scalp.

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:46.007
There is emotional damage done
when young people can't be themselves,

00:03:46.504 --> 00:03:51.238
when they are forced to edit who they are
in order to be acceptable.

00:03:52.627 --> 00:03:54.637
It's a kind of violence.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.985
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential
success story.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.199
I attended boarding school
and college in New England,

00:04:05.223 --> 00:04:07.303
studied abroad in Chile

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:10.442
and returned to the Bronx
to be a middle school teacher.

00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:13.424
I received a Truman Scholarship,

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:16.666
a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.220
And I could list more.

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:19.759
(Laughter)

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:21.312
But I won't.

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:22.734
(Laughter)

00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:27.041
I earned my doctorate
at Columbia University.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:28.883
(Cheers)

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.713
(Applause)

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.079
And then I landed a job at Yale.

00:04:33.103 --> 00:04:34.869
(Applause)

00:04:35.363 --> 00:04:39.645
I am proud of everything
that I've been able to accomplish

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:41.948
on my journey thus far.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.847
I have eternal imposter syndrome.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.059
Either I've been invited
because I'm a token,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.290
which really isn't about me,

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:57.404
but rather, about a box
someone needed to check off.

00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:00.983
Or, I am exceptional,

00:05:01.673 --> 00:05:05.995
which means I've had to leave
the people I love behind.

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:13.573
It's the price that I and so many others
pay for learning while black.

00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:18.761
(Applause)

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.470
I police myself all the time.

00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:29.491
Are my pants too tight?

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:33.372
Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:37.171
Should I speak up for myself,

00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:41.893
or will the power of my words
be reduced to: "She's angry"?

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:46.724
Why did I have to leave the Bronx

00:05:46.748 --> 00:05:49.607
to gain access to a better education?

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:55.894
And why, in the process
of getting that better education,

00:05:55.918 --> 00:06:01.798
did I have to endure the trauma
of erasing what made me, me --

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.952
a black girl from the Bronx,
raised by an Antiguan mother?

00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.534
So when I think about our current
education reform initiatives,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.203
I can't help asking:

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:21.881
What are our students of color
learning about themselves?

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.117
Three -- three decades of research reveal

00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:30.407
that students of color
are suspended and expelled

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.546
at a rate three times greater
than white students,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.349
and are punished in harsher ways
for the same infractions.

00:06:41.138 --> 00:06:44.635
They also learn this through the absence
of their lives and narratives

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.858
in the curricula.

00:06:47.432 --> 00:06:52.317
The Cooperative Children's Book Center
did a review of nearly 4,000 books

00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:56.927
and found that only three percent
were about African-Americans.

00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:00.049
And they further learn this

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:02.899
through the lack of teachers
that look like them.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.989
An analysis of data

00:07:07.013 --> 00:07:10.727
from the National Center
for Education Statistics

00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:15.907
found that 45 percent of our nation's
pre-K to high school students

00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:17.558
were people of color,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.724
while only 17 percent of our teachers are.

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.718
Our youth of color pay a profound price

00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:29.860
when their schooling
sends them the message

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.013
that they must be controlled,

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.863
that they must leave
their identities at home

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.980
in order to be successful.

00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:42.314
Every child deserves an education

00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:45.859
that guarantees the safety to learn

00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:50.230
in the comfort of one's own skin.

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:55.442
(Applause)

00:07:59.551 --> 00:08:04.794
It is possible to create emotionally
and physically safe classrooms

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.544
where students also thrive academically.

00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.901
I know, because I did it in my classroom

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.051
when I returned to teach in the Bronx.

00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.310
So what did that look like?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.074
I centered my instruction

00:08:21.098 --> 00:08:25.249
on the lives, histories
and identities of my students.

00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:29.613
And I did all of this
because I wanted my students to know

00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:33.324
that everyone around them
was supporting them

00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:35.255
to be their best self.

00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:42.297
So while I could not control
the instability of their homes,

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.972
the uncertainty of their next meal,

00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:47.922
or the loud neighbors
that kept them from sleep,

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:52.007
I provided them with a loving classroom

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.748
that made them feel proud of who they are,

00:08:55.313 --> 00:08:58.118
that made them know that they mattered.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.823
You know,

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:08.073
every time I hear
or say the word "asking,"

00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:12.431
I am in high school again.

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:18.549
I am thinking about "ass" and "king"

00:09:20.117 --> 00:09:24.182
and putting the two together
so that I speak in a way

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:27.742
where someone in power
will want to listen.

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:31.788
There is a better way,

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:35.979
one that doesn't force kids of color
into a double bind;

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:39.161
a way for them to preserve their ties

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:41.931
to their families, homes and communities;

00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:47.641
a way that teaches them
to trust their instincts

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:54.110
and to have faith
in their own creative genius.

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:56.327
Thank you.

00:09:56.351 --> 00:10:04.370
(Applause)
