00:00:00.902 --> 00:00:03.500
When people find out
I write about time management,

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:06.263
they assume two things.

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:10.548
One is that I'm always on time,

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:12.984
and I'm not.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:14.870
I have four small children,

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.710
and I would like to blame them
for my occasional tardiness,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.842
but sometimes it's just not their fault.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:23.112
I was once late to my own speech
on time management.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:24.176
(Laughter)

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.773
We all had to just take a moment
together and savor that irony.

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:32.191
The second thing they assume
is that I have lots of tips and tricks

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:34.108
for saving bits of time here and there.

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:37.846
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines
that are doing a story along these lines,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.197
generally on how to help their readers
find an extra hour in the day.

00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.507
And the idea is that we'll shave
bits of time off everyday activities,

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:45.708
add it up,

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.906
and we'll have time for the good stuff.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.964
I question the entire premise
of this piece, but I'm always interested

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:54.671
in hearing what they've come
up with before they call me.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:55.847
Some of my favorites:

00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:58.777
doing errands where you only
have to make right-hand turns --

00:00:58.801 --> 00:00:59.829
(Laughter)

00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:01.999
Being extremely judicious
in microwave usage:

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:04.746
it says three to three-and-a-half
minutes on the package,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.206
we're totally getting in on
the bottom side of that.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.969
And my personal favorite,
which makes sense on some level,

00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:13.745
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can
fast-forward through the commercials.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:16.061
That way, you save
eight minutes every half hour,

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:18.182
so in the course of two hours
of watching TV,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.749
you find 32 minutes to exercise.

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:20.789
(Laughter)

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.098
Which is true.

00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:25.208
You know another way to find
32 minutes to exercise?

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:27.961
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.001
(Laughter)

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.499
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
of time here and there, add it up,

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.807
we will finally get
to everything we want to do.

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.743
But after studying how successful
people spend their time

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.404
and looking at their
schedules hour by hour,

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.724
I think this idea
has it completely backward.

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.947
We don't build the lives
we want by saving time.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.126
We build the lives we want,

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.603
and then time saves itself.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:56.345
Here's what I mean.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.063
I recently did a time diary project

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:02.291
looking at 1,001 days in the lives
of extremely busy women.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.959
They had demanding jobs,
sometimes their own businesses,

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.118
kids to care for,
maybe parents to care for,

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:08.472
community commitments --

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.309
busy, busy people.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.006
I had them keep track
of their time for a week

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.343
so I could add up how much
they worked and slept,

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.176
and I interviewed them
about their strategies, for my book.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.189
One of the women whose time log I studied

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:22.276
goes out on a Wednesday night
for something.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.929
She comes home to find
that her water heater has broken,

00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:27.589
and there is now water
all over her basement.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.834
If you've ever had anything
like this happen to you,

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.738
you know it is a hugely damaging,
frightening, sopping mess.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:36.472
So she's dealing with the immediate
aftermath that night,

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:38.373
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:41.897
day after that, professional cleaning
crew dealing with the ruined carpet.

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.987
All this is being recorded
on her time log.

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.311
Winds up taking seven hours of her week.

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:48.473
Seven hours.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.981
That's like finding
an extra hour in the day.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.628
But I'm sure if you had asked her
at the start of the week,

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.870
"Could you find seven hours
to train for a triathlon?"

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.698
"Could you find seven hours
to mentor seven worthy people?"

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:06.413
I'm sure she would've said
what most of us would've said,

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:10.881
which is, "No -- can't you see
how busy I am?"

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.318
Yet when she had to find seven hours

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:16.141
because there is water
all over her basement,

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.675
she found seven hours.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:23.206
And what this shows us
is that time is highly elastic.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.637
We cannot make more time,

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.840
but time will stretch to accommodate
what we choose to put into it.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.933
And so the key to time management

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.776
is treating our priorities

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.847
as the equivalent
of that broken water heater.

00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:41.312
To get at this,

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:44.781
I like to use language from one
of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.093
By busy, I mean she was running
a small business

00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:48.586
with 12 people on the payroll,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.633
she had six children in her spare time.

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:53.275
I was getting in touch with her
to set up an interview

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.795
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.628
I remember it was a Thursday morning,

00:03:57.652 --> 00:03:59.659
and she was not available
to speak with me.

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:00.839
Of course, right?

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:03.282
But the reason she was
unavailable to speak with me

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:05.246
is that she was out for a hike,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.308
because it was a beautiful spring morning,

00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:08.895
and she wanted to go for a hike.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.256
So of course this makes me
even more intrigued,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.456
and when I finally do catch up with her,
she explains it like this.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.747
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:21.205
every minute I spend, is my choice."

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.981
And rather than say,

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.434
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:31.007
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z
because it's not a priority."

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.077
"I don't have time," often means
"It's not a priority."

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.963
If you think about it,
that's really more accurate language.

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:42.551
I could tell you I don't have time
to dust my blinds,

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:43.744
but that's not true.

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:46.208
If you offered to pay me $100,000
to dust my blinds,

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:47.832
I would get to it pretty quickly.

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:48.872
(Laughter)

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.531
Since that is not going to happen,

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.159
I can acknowledge this is not
a matter of lacking time;

00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:54.784
it's that I don't want to do it.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:58.194
Using this language reminds us
that time is a choice.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:04:59.391
And granted,

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.447
there may be horrible consequences
for making different choices,

00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.677
I will give you that.

00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.323
But we are smart people,

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.205
and certainly over the long run,

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.229
we have the power to fill our lives

00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:11.929
with the things that deserve to be there.

00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:14.492
So how do we do that?

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:16.559
How do we treat our priorities

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.914
as the equivalent
of that broken water heater?

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:21.850
Well, first we need
to figure out what they are.

00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:24.628
I want to give you two strategies
for thinking about this.

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:26.410
The first, on the professional side:

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:28.945
I'm sure many people
coming up to the end of the year

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.292
are giving or getting
annual performance reviews.

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:33.581
You look back over
your successes over the year,

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:35.650
your "opportunities for growth."

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:37.697
And this serves its purpose,

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.151
but I find it's more effective
to do this looking forward.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.769
So I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year.

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:46.687
You're giving yourself
a performance review,

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:51.227
and it has been an absolutely
amazing year for you professionally.

00:05:52.034 --> 00:05:57.821
What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing?

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:02.534
So you can write next
year's performance review now.

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.805
And you can do this
for your personal life, too.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:07.458
I'm sure many of you,
like me, come December,

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:11.028
get cards that contain these folded up
sheets of colored paper,

00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:16.321
on which is written what is known
as the family holiday letter.

00:06:16.345 --> 00:06:17.983
(Laughter)

00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:20.638
Bit of a wretched genre
of literature, really,

00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:23.946
going on about how amazing
everyone in the household is,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.257
or even more scintillating,

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.456
how busy everyone in the household is.

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.464
But these letters serve a purpose,

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:31.695
which is that they tell
your friends and family

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.044
what you did in your personal life
that mattered to you over the year.

00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:36.452
So this year's kind of done,

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:38.926
but I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.704
and it has been an absolutely amazing year

00:06:42.172 --> 00:06:44.825
for you and the people you care about.

00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:50.094
What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing?

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.980
So you can write next
year's family holiday letter now.

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:56.982
Don't send it.

00:06:57.006 --> 00:06:58.022
(Laughter)

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.684
Please, don't send it.

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:02.439
But you can write it.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:06.177
And now, between the performance
review and the family holiday letter,

00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.438
we have a list of six to ten goals
we can work on in the next year.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:12.261
And now we need to break
these down into doable steps.

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:14.493
So maybe you want
to write a family history.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.770
First, you can read
some other family histories,

00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:18.056
get a sense for the style.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.287
Then maybe think about the questions
you want to ask your relatives,

00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:23.160
set up appointments to interview them.

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:24.645
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.830
So you need to find a race and sign up,
figure out a training plan,

00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:30.227
and dig those shoes
out of the back of the closet.

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.193
And then -- this is key --

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:36.312
we treat our priorities as the equivalent
of that broken water heater,

00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:39.335
by putting them into our schedules first.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.639
We do this by thinking through our weeks
before we are in them.

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:48.347
I find a really good time to do this
is Friday afternoons.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.433
Friday afternoon is what
an economist might call

00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:53.994
a "low opportunity cost" time.

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:57.664
Most of us are not sitting there
on Friday afternoons saying,

00:07:57.688 --> 00:07:59.567
"I am excited to make progress

00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:01.887
toward my personal
and professional priorities

00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.065
right now."

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:04.105
(Laughter)

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.746
But we are willing to think
about what those should be.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.975
So take a little bit
of time Friday afternoon,

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:15.189
make yourself a three-category priority
list: career, relationships, self.

00:08:16.382 --> 00:08:19.580
Making a three-category list reminds us

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:23.094
that there should be something
in all three categories.

00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:24.374
Career, we think about;

00:08:24.398 --> 00:08:25.905
relationships, self --

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:27.248
not so much.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.170
But anyway, just a short list,

00:08:29.194 --> 00:08:30.623
two to three items in each.

00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:33.394
Then look out over the whole
of the next week,

00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:35.133
and see where you can plan them in.

00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.181
Where you plan them in is up to you.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:41.667
I know this is going to be more
complicated for some people than others.

00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:45.213
I mean, some people's lives
are just harder than others.

00:08:45.674 --> 00:08:48.943
It is not going to be easy
to find time to take that poetry class

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.697
if you are caring for multiple
children on your own.

00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:53.229
I get that.

00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:55.460
And I don't want to minimize
anyone's struggle.

00:08:55.484 --> 00:09:00.010
But I do think that the numbers
I am about to tell you are empowering.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:04.913
There are 168 hours in a week.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:10.663
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:14.028
That is a lot of time.

00:09:14.627 --> 00:09:17.818
If you are working a full-time
job, so 40 hours a week,

00:09:17.842 --> 00:09:20.934
sleeping eight hours a night,
so 56 hours a week --

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.538
that leaves 72 hours for other things.

00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:26.529
That is a lot of time.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.841
You say you're working 50 hours a week,

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:30.811
maybe a main job and a side hustle.

00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:33.305
Well, that leaves 62 hours
for other things.

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.229
You say you're working 60 hours.

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:37.681
Well, that leaves 52 hours
for other things.

00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:39.747
You say you're working more than 60 hours.

00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:41.328
Well, are you sure?

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.086
(Laughter)

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.016
There was once a study comparing
people's estimated work weeks

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.435
with time diaries.

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:50.135
They found that people claiming
75-plus-hour work weeks

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:52.263
were off by about 25 hours.

00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:53.981
(Laughter)

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.326
You can guess in which direction, right?

00:09:57.567 --> 00:09:59.780
Anyway, in 168 hours a week,

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:02.768
I think we can find time
for what matters to you.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.990
If you want to spend
more time with your kids,

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:07.319
you want to study more
for a test you're taking,

00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:10.688
you want to exercise for three hours
and volunteer for two,

00:10:10.712 --> 00:10:11.866
you can.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.531
And that's even if you're working
way more than full-time hours.

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:17.937
So we have plenty of time, which is great,

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.187
because guess what?

00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:22.049
We don't even need that much
time to do amazing things.

00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:25.233
But when most of us have
bits of time, what do we do?

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.359
Pull out the phone, right?

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.995
Start deleting emails.

00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:32.468
Otherwise, we're puttering
around the house

00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:33.752
or watching TV.

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:36.967
But small moments can have great power.

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:39.610
You can use your bits of time

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.290
for bits of joy.

00:10:43.195 --> 00:10:46.064
Maybe it's choosing to read
something wonderful on the bus

00:10:46.088 --> 00:10:47.452
on the way to work.

00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:49.875
I know when I had a job
that required two bus rides

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.444
and a subway ride every morning,

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:54.371
I used to go to the library
on weekends to get stuff to read.

00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:58.886
It made the whole experience
almost, almost, enjoyable.

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:03.044
Breaks at work can be used
for meditating or praying.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:06.628
If family dinner is out
because of your crazy work schedule,

00:11:06.652 --> 00:11:09.401
maybe family breakfast
could be a good substitute.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.020
It's about looking at
the whole of one's time

00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:15.177
and seeing where the good stuff can go.

00:11:16.504 --> 00:11:18.217
I truly believe this.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.755
There is time.

00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:24.633
Even if we are busy,

00:11:25.223 --> 00:11:26.962
we have time for what matters.

00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:29.754
And when we focus on what matters,

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:31.983
we can build the lives we want

00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:34.043
in the time we've got.

00:11:34.638 --> 00:11:35.793
Thank you.

00:11:35.817 --> 00:11:40.941
(Applause)
