00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.075
This is a tuberculosis ward,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.916
and at the time this picture was taken
in the late 1800s,

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.556
one in seven of all people

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.340
died from tuberculosis.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.540
We had no idea
what was causing this disease.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.196
The hypothesis was actually

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.476
it was your constitution
that made you susceptible.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.236
And it was a highly romanticized disease.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.076
It was also called consumption,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.236
and it was the disorder of poets

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.996
and artists and intellectuals.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.756
And some people actually thought
it gave you heightened sensitivity

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.980
and conferred creative genius.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.836
By the 1950s,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.436
we instead knew
that tuberculosis was caused

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.836
by a highly contagious
bacterial infection,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.036
which is slightly less romantic,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.316
but that had the upside

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.676
of us being able to maybe
develop drugs to treat it.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.716
So doctors had discovered
a new drug, iproniazid,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.116
that they were optimistic
might cure tuberculosis,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.916
and they gave it to patients,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.716
and patients were elated.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.236
They were more social, more energetic.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.860
One medical report actually says
they were "dancing in the halls."

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.116
And unfortunately,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.860
this was not necessarily
because they were getting better.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.620
A lot of them were still dying.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.260
Another medical report describes them
as being "inappropriately happy."

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.820
And that is how the first
antidepressant was discovered.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.036
So accidental discovery
is not uncommon in science,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.196
but it requires more
than just a happy accident.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.660
You have to be able to recognize it
for discovery to occur.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.236
As a neuroscientist,
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.676
about my firsthand experience

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.916
with whatever you want to call
the opposite of dumb luck --

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.556
let's call it smart luck.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.300
But first, a bit more background.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.116
Thankfully, since the 1950s,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.116
we've developed some other drugs
and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.795
And at least in the United States,
though not necessarily in other countries,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.316
we have closed our sanitoriums

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.020
and probably most of you
are not too worried about TB.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.556
But a lot of what was true
in the early 1900s

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.436
about infectious disease,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.100
we can say now
about psychiatric disorders.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.836
We are in the middle
of an epidemic of mood disorders

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.620
like depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.156
One in four of all adults
in the United States

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.660
suffers from mental illness,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.316
which means that if you haven't
experienced it personally

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.636
or someone in your family hasn't,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.916
it's still very likely
that someone you know has,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.580
though they may not talk about it.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.516
Depression has actually now surpassed

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.396
HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.676
as the leading cause
of disability worldwide.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.316
And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.396
we don't know what causes it.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.356
Once it's developed, it's chronic,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.876
lasts a lifetime,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.220
and there are no known cures.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.876
The second antidepressant we discovered,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.356
also by accident, in the 1950s,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.580
from an antihistamine
that was making people manic,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.060
imipramine.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.876
And in both the case of the tuberculosis
ward and the antihistamine,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.596
someone had to be able to recognize

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.036
that a drug that was designed
to do one thing --

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.636
treat tuberculosis
or suppress allergies --

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.396
could be used to do
something very different --

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.620
treat depression.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.396
And this sort of repurposing
is actually quite challenging.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.356
When doctors first saw
this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.836
they didn't really recognize
what they saw.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.716
They were so used to thinking about it

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.516
from the framework
of being a tuberculosis drug

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.596
that they actually just listed it

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.396
as a side effect, an adverse side effect.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.571
As you can see here,

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:05.620
a lot of these patients in 1954
are experiencing severe euphoria.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.516
And they were worried
that this might somehow interfere

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.396
with their recovering from tuberculosis.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.676
So they recommended that iproniazid
only be used in cases of extreme TB

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.380
and in patients that were
highly emotionally stable,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.116
which is of course the exact opposite
of how we use it as an antidepressant.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.596
They were so used to looking at it
from the perspective of this one disease,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540
they could not see the larger implications
for another disease.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.076
And to be fair,
it's not entirely their fault.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.876
Functional fixedness
is a bias that affects all of us.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.356
It's a tendency to only
be able to think of an object

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.980
in terms of its traditional
use or function.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.636
And mental set is another thing. Right?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.676
That's sort of this preconceived framework

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.476
with which we approach problems.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.756
And that actually makes repurposing
pretty hard for all of us,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.316
which is, I guess, why they gave
a TV show to the guy who was,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.140
like, really great at repurposing.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.540
(Laughter)

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.516
So the effects in both the case
of iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.916
they were so strong --

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.156
there was mania,
or people dancing in the halls.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.316
It's actually not that surprising
they were caught.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.820
But it does make you wonder
what else we've missed.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.196
So iproniazid and imipramine,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.636
they're more than just
a case study in repurposing.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.636
They have two other things in common
that are really important.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.156
One, they have terrible side effects.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.796
That includes liver toxicity,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.796
weight gain of over 50 pounds,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.596
suicidality.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.796
And two, they both
increase levels of serotonin,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.156
which is a chemical signal in the brain,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.380
or a neurotransmitter.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.876
And those two things together,
right, one or the two,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.516
may not have been that important,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.276
but the two together meant
that we had to develop safer drugs,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.820
and that serotonin seemed
like a pretty good place to start.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.556
So we developed drugs
to more specifically focus on serotonin,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.236
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.996
the most famous of which is Prozac.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.996
And that was 30 years ago,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.220
and since then we have mostly
just worked on optimizing those drugs.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.956
And the SSRIs, they are better
than the drugs that came before them,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.076
but they still have a lot of side effects,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.996
including weight gain, insomnia,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.220
suicidality --

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.436
and they take a really long time to work,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.996
something like four to six weeks
in a lot of patients.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.196
And that's in the patients
where they do work.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.076
There are a lot of patients
where these drugs don't work.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.476
And that means now, in 2016,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.316
we still have no cures
for any mood disorders,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.396
just drugs that suppress symptoms,

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.476
which is kind of the difference between
taking a painkiller for an infection

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.916
versus an antibiotic.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.796
A painkiller will make you feel better,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.900
but is not going to do anything
to treat that underlying disease.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.036
And it was this flexibility
in our thinking

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.996
that let us recognize
that iproniazid and imipramine

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.116
could be repurposed in this way,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.116
which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.140
which we then, ironically, fixated on.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.516
This is brain signaling, serotonin,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.796
from an SSRI commercial.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.180
In case you're not clear,
this is a dramatization.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.716
And in science, we try
and remove our bias, right,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.116
by running double-blinded experiments

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.836
or being statistically agnostic
as to what our results will be.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.156
But bias creeps in more insidiously
in what we choose to study

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.900
and how we choose to study it.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.836
So we've focused on serotonin now
for the past 30 years,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.100
often to the exclusion of other things.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.220
We still have no cures,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.596
and what if serotonin
isn't all there is to depression?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.676
What if it's not even the key part of it?

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.876
That means no matter how much time

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.636
or money or effort we put into it,

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.580
it will never lead to a cure.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.076
In the past few years,
doctors have discovered

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.020
probably what is the first truly new
antidepressant since the SSRIs,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.836
Calypsol,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.316
and this drug works very quickly,
within a few hours or a day,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.236
and it doesn't work on serotonin.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.940
It works on glutamate,
which is another neurotransmitter.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.876
And it's also repurposed.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.980
It was traditionally used
as anesthesia in surgery.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.196
But unlike those other drugs,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.036
which were recognized pretty quickly,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.756
it took us 20 years

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.436
to realize that Calypsol
was an antidepressant,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.316
despite the fact that it's actually
a better antidepressant,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.956
probably, than those other drugs.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.076
It's actually probably because of the fact
that it's a better antidepressant

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.995
that it was harder for us to recognize.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.100
There was no mania to signal its effects.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.676
So in 2013, up at Columbia University,

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.276
I was working with my colleague,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.276
Dr. Christine Ann Denny,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.100
and we were studying Calypsol
as an antidepressant in mice.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.476
And Calypsol has, like,
a really short half-life,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.556
which means it's out of your body
within a few hours.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.996
And we were just piloting.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.276
So we would give an injection to mice,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.596
and then we'd wait a week,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.300
and then we'd run
another experiment to save money.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.156
And one of the experiments I was running,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.836
we would stress the mice,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.076
and we used that as a model of depression.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.436
And at first it kind of just looked
like it didn't really work at all.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.980
So we could have stopped there.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.436
But I have run this model
of depression for years,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.356
and the data just looked kind of weird.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.236
It didn't really look right to me.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.476
So I went back,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.996
and we reanalyzed it

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.836
based on whether or not they had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.060
a week beforehand.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.956
And it looked kind of like this.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.116
So if you look at the far left,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.636
if you put a mouse in a new space,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.916
this is the box, it's very exciting,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.076
a mouse will walk around and explore,

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.396
and you can see that pink line
is actually the measure of them walking.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.596
And we also give it
another mouse in a pencil cup

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.676
that it can decide to interact with.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.916
This is also a dramatization,
in case that's not clear.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.636
And a normal mouse will explore.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.900
It will be social.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.996
Check out what's going on.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.916
If you stress a mouse
in this depression model,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.220
which is the middle box,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.996
they aren't social, they don't explore.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.300
They mostly just kind of hide
in that back corner, behind a cup.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.116
Yet the mice that had gotten
that one injection of Calypsol,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.340
here on your right,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.020
they were exploring, they were social.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.220
They looked like they
had never been stressed at all,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.220
which is impossible.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.980
So we could have just stopped there,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.076
but Christine had also used
Calypsol before as anesthesia,

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.676
and a few years ago she had seen

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.076
that it seemed to have
some weird effects on cells

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.316
and some other behavior

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.356
that also seemed to last
long after the drug,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.636
maybe a few weeks.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.916
So we were like, OK,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.116
maybe this is not completely impossible,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.636
but we were really skeptical.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.196
So we did what you do in science
when you're not sure,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.420
and we ran it again.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.476
And I remember being in the animal room,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.156
moving mice from box to box
to test them,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.796
and Christine was actually sitting
on the floor with the computer in her lap

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.236
so the mice couldn't see her,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.516
and she was analyzing
the data in real time.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.916
And I remember us yelling,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.236
which you're not supposed to do
in an animal room where you're testing,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.836
because it had worked.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.236
It seemed like these mice
were protected against stress,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.316
or they were inappropriately happy,
however you want to call it.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.780
And we were really excited.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.300
And then we were really skeptical,
because it was too good to be true.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.060
So we ran it again.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.476
And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.916
and we ran it again
in a physiological model,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.156
where all we did was give stress hormones.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.796
And we had our undergrads run it.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.940
And then we had our collaborators
halfway across the world in France run it.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.996
And every time someone ran it,
they confirmed the same thing.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.836
It seemed like
this one injection of Calypsol

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.620
was somehow protecting
against stress for weeks.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.036
And we only published this a year ago,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.140
but since then other labs
have independently confirmed this effect.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.860
So we don't know what causes depression,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.156
but we do know that stress
is the initial trigger

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.516
in 80 percent of cases,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.756
and depression and PTSD
are different diseases,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.796
but this is something
they share in common.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.636
Right? It is traumatic stress

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.556
like active combat or natural disasters

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.036
or community violence or sexual assault

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.340
that causes post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.596
and not everyone that is exposed to stress
develops a mood disorder.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.516
And this ability to experience
stress and be resilient

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.700
and bounce back and not develop
depression or PTSD

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.756
is known as stress resilience,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.636
and it varies between people.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.996
And we have always thought of it
as just sort of this passive property.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.556
It's the absence of susceptibility factors

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.660
and risk factors for these disorders.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.500
But what if it were active?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.916
Maybe we could enhance it,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.100
sort of akin to putting on armor.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.820
We had accidentally discovered
the first resilience-enhancing drug.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.516
And like I said, we only gave
a tiny amount of the drug,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.116
and it lasted for weeks,

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.356
and that's not like anything
you see with antidepressants.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.700
But it is actually kind of similar
to what you see in immune vaccines.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.116
So in immune vaccines,
you'll get your shots,

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.516
and then weeks, months, years later,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.876
when you're actually exposed to bacteria,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.356
it's not the vaccine in your body
that protects you.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.756
It's your own immune system

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.916
that's developed resistance and resilience
to this bacteria that fights it off,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.076
and you actually never get the infection,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.156
which is very different
from, say, our treatments. Right?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.996
In that case, you get the infection,
you're exposed to the bacteria,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.876
you're sick, and then you take,
say, an antibiotic which cures it,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.140
and those drugs are actually working
to kill the bacteria.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.276
Or similar to as I said before,
with this palliative,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.156
you'll take something
that will suppress the symptoms,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.876
but it won't treat
the underlying infection,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.236
and you'll only feel better
during the time in which you're taking it,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.196
which is why you have to keep taking it.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.916
And in depression and PTSD --

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.916
here we have your stress exposure --

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.556
we only have palliative care.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.076
Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.956
and that is why you basically
have to keep taking them

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.676
for the life of the disease,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.900
which is often
the length of your own life.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.156
So we're calling our resilience-enhancing
drugs "paravaccines,"

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.716
which means vaccine-like,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.236
because it seems
like they might have the potential

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.076
to protect against stress

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.516
and prevent mice from developing

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.300
depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.220
Also, not all antidepressants
are also paravaccines.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.916
We tried Prozac as well,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.300
and that had no effect.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.076
So if this were to translate into humans,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.676
we might be able to protect people

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.956
who are predictably at risk

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.836
against stress-induced disorders
like depression and PTSD.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.996
So that's first responders
and firefighters,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.156
refugees, prisoners and prison guards,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.260
soldiers, you name it.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.020
And to give you a sense
of the scale of these diseases,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.676
in 2010, the global burden of disease

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.540
was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.596
and since they are chronic,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.836
that cost is compounding
and is therefore expected to rise

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.100
up to six trillion dollars
in just the next 15 years.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.039
As I mentioned before,

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:38.140
repurposing can be challenging
because of our prior biases.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.380
Calypsol has another name,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.300
ketamine,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.940
which also goes by another name,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.876
Special K,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.300
which is a club drug and drug of abuse.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.636
It's still used across the world
as an anesthetic.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.516
It's used in children.
We use it on the battlefield.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.516
It's actually the drug of choice
in a lot of developing nations,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.396
because it doesn't affect breathing.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.100
It is on the World Health Organization
list of most essential medicines.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.140
If we had discovered ketamine
as a paravaccine first,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.676
it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.556
but as is, we have to compete
with our functional fixedness

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.380
and mental set that kind of interfere.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.556
Fortunately, it's not
the only compound we have discovered

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.020
that has these prophylactic,
paravaccine qualities,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.900
but all of the other drugs
we've discovered,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.956
or compounds if you will,
they're totally new,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.596
they have to go through
the entire FDA approval process --

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.196
if they make it before
they can ever be used in humans.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.876
And that will be years.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.156
So if we wanted something sooner,

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.556
ketamine is already FDA-approved.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.276
It's generic, it's available.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.460
We could develop it for a fraction
of the price and a fraction of the time.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.756
But actually, beyond
functional fixedness and mental set,

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.356
there's a real other challenge
to repurposing drugs,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.579
which is policy.

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:08.395
There are no incentives in place

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:12.155
once a drug is generic and off patent
and no longer exclusive

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:14.516
to encourage pharma companies
to develop them,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.969
because they don't make money.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.500
And that's not true for just ketamine.
That is true for all drugs.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:26.236
Regardless, the idea itself
is completely novel in psychiatry,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.156
to use drugs to prevent mental illness

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.540
as opposed to just treat it.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.796
It is possible that 20, 50,
100 years from now,

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.916
we will look back now
at depression and PTSD

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.156
the way we look back
at tuberculosis sanitoriums

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.380
as a thing of the past.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.420
This could be the beginning of the end
of the mental health epidemic.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.580
But as a great scientist once said,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.156
"Only a fool is sure of anything.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.220
A wise man keeps on guessing."

00:18:04.044 --> 00:18:05.284
Thank you, guys.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.846
(Applause)
