00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.256
Tell your daughters of this year,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.376
how we woke needing coffee

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.216
but discovered instead cadavers
strewn about our morning papers,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.040
waterlogged facsimiles
of our sisters, spouses, small children.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.216
Say to your baby of this year
when she asks, as she certainly should,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.816
tell her it was too late coming.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.296
Admit even in the year we leased freedom,
we didn't own it outright.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.136
There were still laws
for every way we used our privates

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.656
while they pawed at the soft folds of us,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.415
grabbed with no concern for consent,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.056
no laws made for the men
that enforced them.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.496
We were trained to dodge,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.136
to wait, to cower and cover,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.056
to wait more, still, wait.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.960
We were told to be silent.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.696
But speak to your girls of this wartime,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.296
a year preceded by a score of the same,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.576
so as in two decades before,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.136
we wiped our eyes,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.056
laced caskets with flags,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.256
evacuated the crime scene of the club,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.576
caterwauled in the street,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.896
laid our bodies on the concrete
against the outlines of our fallen,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.855
cried, "Of course we mattered,"

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.256
chanted for our disappeared.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.880
The women wept this year.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.656
They did.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.136
In the same year, we were ready.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.256
The year we lost our inhibition
and moved with courageous abandon

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.776
was also the year we stared down barrels,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.136
sang of cranes in skies,
ducked and parried,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.616
caught gold in hijab,
collected death threats,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.976
knew ourselves as patriots,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.216
said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down
and found a running mate,"

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.376
made road maps for infant joy,
shamed nothing but fear,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.656
called ourselves fat and meant, of course,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.896
impeccable.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.856
This year, we were women,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.656
not brides or trinkets,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.176
not an off-brand gender,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.336
not a concession, but women.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.656
Instruct your babies.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.056
Remind them that the year has passed
to be docile or small.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.696
Some of us said for the first time
that we were women,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.096
took this oath of solidarity seriously.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.376
Some of us bore children
and some of us did not,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.816
and none of us questioned
whether that made us real

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.616
or appropriate or true.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.776
When she asks you of this year,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.705
your daughter, whether your offspring
or heir to your triumph,

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.736
from her comforted side of history
teetering towards woman,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.056
she will wonder and ask voraciously,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.015
though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.816
she will hold your estimation of it holy,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.336
curiously probing, "Where were you?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.376
Did you fight?
Were you fearful or fearsome?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.256
What colored the walls of your regret?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.936
What did you do for women
in the year it was time?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.856
This path you made for me,
which bones had to break?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.136
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.376
And are you a hero?"

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.816
She will ask the difficult questions.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.016
She will not care
about the arc of your brow,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.296
the weight of your clutch.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.976
She will not ask of your mentions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.376
Your daughter, for whom you have
already carried so much, wants to know

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.896
what you brought, what gift,
what light did you keep from extinction?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.856
When they came for victims in the night,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.976
did you sleep through it
or were you roused?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.656
What was the cost of staying woke?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.146
What, in the year we said time's up,
what did you do with your privilege?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.696
Did you sup on others' squalor?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.856
Did you look away
or directly into the flame?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.416
Did you know your skill
or treat it like a liability?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.776
Were you fooled by the epithets
of "nasty" or "less than"?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.296
Did you teach with an open heart
or a clenched fist?

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.536
Where were you?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.416
Tell her the truth. Make it your life.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.416
Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.656
with the moment
drawn on my face like a dagger,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.016
and flung it back at itself,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.456
slicing space for you."

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.296
Tell her the truth, how you lived
in spite of crooked odds.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.576
Tell her you were brave,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.936
and always, always
in the company of courage,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.256
mostly the days
when you just had yourself.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.256
Tell her she was born as you were,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.896
as your mothers before,
and the sisters beside them,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.016
in the age of legends, like always.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.736
Tell her she was born just in time,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.040
just in time

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.736
to lead.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.096
(Applause)
