WEBVTT

00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.444
Let me ask you all a question.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:08.146
How much weapons-grade nuclear
material do you think it would take

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.929
to level a city the size of San Francisco?

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:13.586
How many of you think
it would be an amount

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.994
about the size of this suitcase?

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.851
OK. And how about this minibus?

00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:23.480
All right.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.198
Well actually, under
the right circumstances,

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:31.673
an amount of highly enriched uranium
about the size of your morning latte

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.615
would be enough to kill 100,000 people

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:35.865
instantly.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:40.028
Hundreds of thousands of others
would become horribly ill,

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:43.641
and parts of the city
would be uninhabitable for years,

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:45.112
if not for decades.

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.556
But you can forget that nuclear latte,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.550
because today's nuclear weapons
are hundreds of times more powerful

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:58.246
even than those we dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:04.210
And even a limited nuclear war
involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:08.386
could lead to the end
of all life on the planet.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.883
So it's really important that you know

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:17.988
that right now we have
over 15,000 nuclear weapons

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:20.227
in the hands of nine nations.

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.880
And if you live in a city
or near a military facility,

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:27.899
one is likely pointed right at you.

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:31.414
In fact, if you live in any
of the rural areas

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:33.920
where nuclear weapons are stored globally,

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:35.567
one is likely pointed at you.

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:40.670
About 1,800 of these weapons
are on high alert,

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:44.384
which means they can be launched
within 15 minutes

00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:46.644
of a presidential command.

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:51.795
So I know this is a bummer of an issue,

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.632
and maybe you have that --
what was it? -- psychic fatigue

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.721
that we heard about a little bit earlier.

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:59.048
So I'm going to switch gears
for just a second,

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.458
and I'm going to talk
about my imaginary friend,

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.268
who I like to think of as Jasmine,

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.638
just for a moment.

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:08.179
Jasmine, at the age of 25,

00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:12.558
is part of a generation that is more
politically and socially engaged

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:14.987
than anything we've seen in 50 years.

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:16.950
She and her friends think of themselves

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.223
as change agents
and leaders and activists.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:23.389
I think of them as Generation Possible.

00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:27.398
They regularly protest
about the issues they care about,

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:30.830
but nuclear weapons are not one of them,
which makes sense,

00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:35.052
because Jasmine was born in 1991,
at the end of the Cold War.

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:38.182
So she didn't grow up hearing a lot
about nuclear weapons.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:41.789
She never had to duck and cover
under her desk at school.

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:46.104
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter
is an app in the Android store.

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:48.823
Nuclear weapons help win games.

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:51.281
And that is really a shame,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:54.579
because right now, we need
Generation Possible

00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:58.894
to help us make some really important
decisions about nuclear weapons.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:05.981
For instance, will we further reduce
our nuclear arsenals globally,

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:08.921
or will we spend billions,

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:11.168
maybe a trillion dollars,

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:14.514
to modernize them so they last
throughout the 21st century,

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:17.837
so that by the time Jasmine is my age,
she's talking to her children

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.792
and maybe even her grandchildren

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.447
about the threat of nuclear holocaust?

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:26.004
And if you're paying any attention
at all to cyberthreats,

00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:29.995
or, for instance, if you've read
about the Stuxnet virus

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.884
or, for God's sake, if you've ever
had an email account or a Yahoo account

00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:35.956
or a phone hacked,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.132
you can imagine the whole new world
of hurt that could be triggered

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:43.321
by modernization in a period
of cyberwarfare.

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:46.161
Now, if you're paying
attention to the money,

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:49.246
a trillion dollars could go a long way

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.113
to feeding and educating
and employing people,

00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:55.872
all of which could reduce the threat
of nuclear war to begin with.

00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:57.845
So --

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.891
(Applause)

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:03.368
This is really crucial right now,

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:06.179
because nuclear weapons --
they're vulnerable.

00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:08.861
We have solid evidence

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.775
that terrorists are trying
to get ahold of them.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.872
Just this last spring,

00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:18.602
when four retirees
and two taxi drivers were arrested

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:20.225
in the Republic of Georgia

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.974
for trying to sell nuclear materials
for 200 million dollars,

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:27.766
they demonstrated that the black market
for this stuff is alive and well.

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.372
And it's really important,

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:33.193
because there have been
dozens of accidents

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:34.498
involving nuclear weapons,

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:37.563
and I bet most of us have never heard
anything about them.

00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:39.129
Just here in the United States,

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:42.651
we've dropped nuclear weapons
on the Carolinas twice.

00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.529
In one case, one of the bombs,

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:47.725
which fell out of an Air Force plane,

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:48.948
didn't detonate

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.085
because the nuclear core
was stored somewhere else on the plane.

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:56.145
In another case, the weapon
did arm when it hit the ground,

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.340
and five of the switches designed
to keep it from detonating failed.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.602
Luckily, the sixth one didn't.

00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:05.838
But if that's not enough
to get your attention,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.060
there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:12.934
That's when Russian radar technicians saw

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.477
what they thought was a US nuclear missile

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.148
streaking towards Russian airspace.

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.892
It later turned out to be
a Norwegian rocket

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.498
collecting data about the northern lights.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:24.676
But at that time,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.471
Russian President Boris Yeltsin
came within five minutes

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.647
of launching a full-scale
retaliatory nuclear attack

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:34.503
against the United States.

00:05:36.924 --> 00:05:40.966
So, most of the world's nuclear nations

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.455
have committed to getting rid
of these weapons of mass destruction.

00:05:45.352 --> 00:05:46.828
But consider this:

00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:51.159
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons,

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:54.620
which is the most widely adopted
arms control treaty in history

00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:56.787
with 190 signatories,

00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:02.692
sets no specific date by which
the world's nuclear-armed nations

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:04.923
will get rid of their nuclear weapons.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:08.462
Now, when John F. Kennedy
sent a man to the moon

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.657
and decided to bring him back,
or decided to do both those things,

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.601
he didn't say, "Hey, whenever
you guys get to it."

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.632
He gave us a deadline.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.478
He gave us a challenge

00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:22.009
that would have been incredible
just a few years earlier.

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:23.535
And with that challenge,

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.434
he inspired scientists and marketers,

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:29.128
astronauts and schoolteachers.

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:31.185
He gave us a vision.

00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:33.903
But along with that vision,

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:37.471
he also tried to give us -- and most
people don't know this, either --

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:39.479
he tried to give us a partner

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:44.924
in the form of our fiercest
Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.

00:06:44.948 --> 00:06:47.982
Because part of Kennedy's vision
for the Apollo program

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:51.793
was that it be a cooperation,
not a competition, with the Soviets.

00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:55.370
And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev,
the Soviet Premier, agreed.

00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:59.323
But before that cooperation
could be realized,

00:06:59.347 --> 00:07:01.018
Kennedy was assassinated,

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:03.391
and that part of the vision was deferred.

00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:09.760
But the promise of joint innovation
between these two nuclear superpowers

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:11.656
wasn't totally extinguished.

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:16.198
Because in 1991, which is the year
that Jasmine was born

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:18.708
and the Soviet Union fell,

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:21.505
these two nations engaged in a project

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.086
that genuinely does seem incredible today

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.156
in the truest sense of that word,

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:31.408
which is that the US sent cash
to the Russians when they needed it most,

00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:34.187
to secure loose nuclear materials

00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:37.416
and to employ out-of-work
nuclear scientists.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.143
They worked alongside American scientists
to convert weapons-grade uranium

00:07:44.167 --> 00:07:48.046
into the type of fuel that can be used
for nuclear power instead.

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:51.473
They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts."

00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:55.338
So the result is that for over 20 years,

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:58.169
our two nations had a program

00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:02.006
that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs
in the United States

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.236
was essentially fueled
by former Russian warheads.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.301
So, together these two nations
did something truly audacious.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:15.974
But the good news is,
the global community has the chance

00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:19.000
to do something just as audacious today.

00:08:20.897 --> 00:08:23.424
To get rid of nuclear weapons

00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:27.986
and to end the supply of the materials
required to produce them,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.702
some experts tell me would take 30 years.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.686
It would take a renaissance of sorts,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.125
the kinds of innovation that,
for better or worse,

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:40.123
underpinned both the Manhattan Project,
which gave rise to nuclear weapons,

00:08:40.147 --> 00:08:42.559
and the Megatons to Megawatts program.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:45.641
It would take design constraints.

00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:48.383
These are fundamental to creativity,

00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:52.423
things like a platform
for international collaboration;

00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:56.139
a date certain, which is
a forcing mechanism;

00:08:56.925 --> 00:09:00.174
and a positive vision
that inspires action.

00:09:00.735 --> 00:09:03.198
It would take us to 2045.

00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:08.949
Now, 2045 happens to be
the 100th anniversary

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:12.247
of the birth of nuclear weapons
in the New Mexico desert.

00:09:13.247 --> 00:09:15.971
But it's also an important date
for another reason.

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:20.321
It's predicted to be the advent
of the singularity,

00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:23.407
a new moment in human development,

00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:28.551
where the lines between artificial
intelligence and human intelligence blur,

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:33.535
where computing and consciousness
become almost indistinguishable

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:39.191
and advanced technologies help us solve
the 21st century's greatest problems:

00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:41.547
hunger, energy, poverty,

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:45.418
ushering in an era of abundance.

00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:47.900
And we all get to go to space

00:09:47.924 --> 00:09:50.783
on our way to becoming
a multi-planetary species.

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:55.891
Now, the people who really believe
this vision are the first to say

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:58.938
they don't yet know precisely
how we're going to get there.

00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:02.410
But the values behind their vision

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:05.765
and the willingness to ask "How might we?"

00:10:05.789 --> 00:10:08.290
have inspired a generation of innovators.

00:10:08.884 --> 00:10:12.356
They're working backward
from the outcomes they want,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.584
using the creative problem-solving methods
of collaborative design.

00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:18.848
They're busting through obstacles.

00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:22.586
They're redefining
what we all consider possible.

00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:24.721
But here's the thing:

00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:29.916
that vision of abundance isn't compatible

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:36.145
with a world that still relies
on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.730
called "mutually assured destruction."

00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:46.422
It has to be about building
the foundations for the 22nd century.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:52.252
It has to be about strategies
for mutually assured prosperity

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:56.256
or, at the very least,
mutually assured survival.

00:10:57.175 --> 00:11:02.398
Now, every day, I get to meet
people who are real pioneers

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:04.339
in the field of nuclear threats.

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:07.864
As you can see, many of them
are young women,

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:10.464
and they're doing fiercely
interesting stuff,

00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:14.991
like Mareena Robinson Snowden here,
who is developing new ways,

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:17.677
better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,

00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.924
which will help us
overcome a critical hurdle

00:11:19.948 --> 00:11:21.882
to international disarmament.

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:24.775
Or Melissa Hanham, who is using
satellite imaging

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:28.904
to make sense of what's going on
around far-flung nuclear sites.

00:11:29.358 --> 00:11:32.055
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:36.352
who has been campaigning
to make nuclear weapons illegal

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:38.060
in international courts of law,

00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:40.976
and just won a big victory
at the UN last week.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.178
(Applause)

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:45.416
And yet,

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.131
and yet,

00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:51.215
with all of our talk in this culture
about moon shots,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:55.967
too few members of Generation Possible
and those of us who mentor them

00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.957
are taking on nuclear weapons.

00:11:58.524 --> 00:12:00.461
It's as if there's a taboo.

00:12:01.898 --> 00:12:06.573
But I remember something Kennedy said
that has really stuck with me,

00:12:06.597 --> 00:12:08.355
and that is something to the effect

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:10.521
that humans can be as big as the solutions

00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:12.403
to all the problems we've created.

00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:15.661
No problem of human destiny, he said,

00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:18.330
is beyond human beings.

00:12:19.296 --> 00:12:20.679
I believe that.

00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:23.644
And I bet a lot of you here
believe that, too.

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:27.162
And I know Generation
Possible believes it.

00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:31.865
So it's time to commit to a date.

00:12:33.183 --> 00:12:36.711
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:39.920
on the 100th anniversary of its inception.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:45.845
After all, by 2045, we will have held
billions of people hostage

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.143
to the threat of nuclear annihilation.

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.433
Surely, 100 years will have been enough.

00:12:51.512 --> 00:12:55.191
Surely, a century of economic development

00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:58.610
and the development of military strategy

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.298
will have given us better ways
to manage global conflict.

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:06.933
Surely, if ever there was a global
moon shot worth supporting,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:08.941
this is it.

00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:12.460
Now, in the face of real threats --

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:15.480
for instance, North Korea's recent
nuclear weapons tests,

00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:17.784
which fly in the face of sanctions --

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:20.108
reasonable people disagree

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:24.031
about whether we should maintain
some number of nuclear weapons

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.582
to deter aggression.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.454
But the question is:
What's the magic number?

00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:31.601
Is it a thousand?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.621
Is it a hundred? Ten?

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:36.673
And then we have to ask:

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.352
Who should be responsible for them?

00:13:40.038 --> 00:13:41.896
I think we can agree, however,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.969
that having 15,000 of them
represents a greater global threat

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.374
to Jasmine's generation than a promise.

00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:52.342
So it's time we make a promise

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:55.079
of a world in which we've broken
the stranglehold

00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:58.601
that nuclear weapons have
on our imaginations;

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.237
in which we invest
in the creative solutions

00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:04.991
that come from working backward
from the future we desperately want,

00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:07.549
rather than plodding forward
from a present

00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:11.933
that brings all of the mental models
and biases of the past with it.

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:17.694
It's time we pledge our resources
as leaders across the spectrum

00:14:17.718 --> 00:14:20.607
to work on this old problem in new ways,

00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:23.231
to ask, "How might we?"

00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:26.304
How might we make good on a promise

00:14:26.328 --> 00:14:29.905
of greater security
for Jasmine's generation

00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:32.894
in a world beyond nuclear weapons?

00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:36.869
I truly hope you will join us.

00:14:37.782 --> 00:14:38.945
Thank you.

00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:42.271
(Applause)

00:14:42.295 --> 00:14:43.968
Thank you.

00:14:43.992 --> 00:14:46.142
(Applause)
