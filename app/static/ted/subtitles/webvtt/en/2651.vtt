WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.096
So what if I could make for you

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.600
a designer baby?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.416
What if you as a parent-to-be

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.440
and I as a scientist decided
to go down that road together?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.296
What if we didn't?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.096
What if we thought, "That's a bad idea,"

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.496
but many of our family,
friends and coworkers

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.160
did make that decision?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.520
Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.736
Let's pretend it's the year 2030,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.159
and you're a parent.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.976
You have your daughter,
Marianne, next to you,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.376
and in 2030, she is what we call a natural

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.920
because she has no genetic modifications.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.720
And because you and your partner
consciously made that decision,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.696
many in your social circle,
they kind of look down on you.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.520
They think you're, like,
a Luddite or a technophobe.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.496
Marianne's best friend Jenna,
who lives right next door,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.040
is a very different story.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.800
She was born a genetically modified
designer baby with numerous upgrades.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.080
Yeah. Upgrades.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.776
And these enhancements were introduced

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.336
using a new genetic
modification technology

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.136
that goes by the funny name CRISPR,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.856
you know, like something's crisp,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.200
this is CRISPR.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.816
The scientist that Jenna's parents
hired to do this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720
for several million dollars

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.440
introduced CRISPR
into a whole panel of human embryos.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.056
And then they used genetic testing,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.136
and they predicted that
that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.080
would be the best of the bunch.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.616
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.856
She's sitting on the carpet
in your living room

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.360
playing with your daughter Marianne.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.176
And your families have known
each other for years now,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.616
and it's become very clear to you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.520
that Jenna is extraordinary.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.216
She's incredibly intelligent.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.496
If you're honest with yourself,
she's smarter than you,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.080
and she's five years old.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.936
She's beautiful, tall, athletic,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.440
and the list goes on and on.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.856
And in fact, there's
a whole new generation

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120
of these GM kids like Jenna.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.056
And so far it looks like

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.416
they're healthier
than their parents' generation,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.176
than your generation.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200
And they have lower health care costs.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.776
They're immune to a host
of health conditions,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.040
including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.760
It all sounds so great,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.496
but you can't help but have
this sort of unsettling feeling,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.520
a gut feeling, that there's something
just not quite right about Jenna,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.280
and you've had the same feeling
about other GM kids that you've met.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.496
You were also reading
in the newspaper earlier this week

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.456
that a study of these children
who were born as designer babies

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.336
indicates they may have some issues,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.040
like increased aggressiveness
and narcissism.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.296
But more immediately on your mind

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.016
is some news that you just got
from Jenna's family.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.536
She's so smart,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.656
she's now going to be going
to a special school,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.176
a different school
than your daughter Marianne,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.936
and this is kind of throwing
your family into a disarray.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.296
Marianne's been crying,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.736
and last night when you took her to bed
to kiss her goodnight,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.240
she said, "Daddy, will Jenna
even be my friend anymore?"

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.016
So now, as I've been telling you
this imagined 2030 story,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.656
I have a feeling
that I may have put some of you

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.256
into this sci-fi
frame of reference. Right?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.776
You think you're reading a sci-fi book.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.736
Or maybe, like,
in Halloween mode of thinking.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.176
But this is really
a possible reality for us,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.840
just 15 years from now.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.416
I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.376
and I can see this new CRISPR technology

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.120
and its potential impact.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.216
And we may find ourselves in that reality,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.320
and a lot will depend
on what we decide to do today.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.456
And if you're still
kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.976
consider that the world of science
had a huge shock earlier this year,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.935
and the public largely
doesn't even know about it.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.736
Researchers in China just a few months ago

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.416
reported the creation
of genetically modified human embryos.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.976
This was the first time in history.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.680
And they did it using
this new CRISPR technology.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.296
It didn't work perfectly,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.896
but I still think
they sort of cracked the door ajar

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.720
on a Pandora's box here.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.376
And I think some people
are going to run with this technology

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.280
and try to make designer babies.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.256
Now, before I go on, some of you
may hold up your hands and say,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.536
"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.376
Wouldn't that be illegal?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.040
You can't just go off
and create a designer baby."

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:03.656
And in fact, to some extent, you're right.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.000
In some countries, you couldn't do that.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.776
But in many other countries,
including my country, the US,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.680
there's actually no law on this,
so in theory, you could do it.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.136
And there was another development
this year that resonates in this area,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.960
and that happened
not so far from here over in the UK.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.576
And the UK traditionally
has been the strictest country

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.416
when it comes to human
genetic modification.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.376
It was illegal there,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.976
but just a few months ago,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.456
they carved out an exception to that rule.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.016
They passed a new law

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.496
allowing the creation
of genetically modified humans

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.640
with the noble goal of trying
to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.096
But still I think in combination
these events are pushing us

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.656
further towards an acceptance

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.600
of human genetic modification.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.736
So I've been talking
about this CRISPR technology.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.800
What actually is CRISPR?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.696
So if you think about the GMOs
that we're all more familiar with,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.936
like GMO tomatoes and wheat

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.896
and things like that,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.536
this technology
is similar to the technologies

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.416
that were used to make those,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.816
but it's dramatically better,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.800
cheaper and faster.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.656
So what is it?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.136
It's actually like
a genetic Swiss army knife.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.416
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.776
with different tools in it,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.936
and one of the tools
is kind of like a magnifying glass

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.400
or a GPS for our DNA,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.456
so it can home in on a certain spot.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.136
And the next tool is like scissors

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.416
that can cut the DNA right in that spot.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.016
And finally we have a pen

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.536
where we can literally rewrite
the genetic code in that location.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.800
It's really that simple.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.336
And this technology, which came
on the scene just three years ago,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.200
has taken science by storm.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.256
It's evolving so fast, and it's
so freaking exciting to scientists,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.080
and I admit I'm fascinated by it
and we use it in my own lab,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.616
that I think someone
is going to go that extra step

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.216
and continue the GM human embryo work

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.640
and maybe make designer babies.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.736
This is so ubiquitous now.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.176
It just came on the scene three years ago.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.536
Thousands of labs
literally have this in hand today,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.936
and they're doing important research.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.576
Most of them are not interested
in designer babies.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.096
They're studying human disease

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.536
and other important elements of science.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.160
So there's a lot of good research
going on with CRISPR.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.416
And the fact that we can
now do genetic modifications

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.216
that used to take years
and cost millions of dollars

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.256
in a few weeks
for a couple thousand bucks,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.416
to me as a scientist that's fantastic,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.576
but again, at the same time,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720
it opens the door to people going too far.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.736
And I think for some people

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.776
the focus is not going to be
so much on science.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.816
That's not what's going
to be driving them.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.360
It's going to be ideology
or the chase for a profit.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.680
And they're going to go
for designer babies.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.096
So why should we be concerned about this?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.336
We know from Darwin,
if we go back two centuries,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.496
that evolution and genetics
profoundly have impacted humanity,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.656
who we are today.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.616
And some think there's like
a social Darwinism at work in our world,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.120
and maybe even a eugenics as well.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.456
Imagine those trends, those forces,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.456
with a booster rocket
of this CRISPR technology

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.200
that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.895
And in fact, we can just go back
one century to the last century

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.920
to see the power that eugenics can have.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.256
So my father, Peter Knoepfler,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.056
was actually born right here in Vienna.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.576
He was Viennese,
and he was born here in 1929.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.496
And when my grandparents
had little baby Peter,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.256
the world was very different. Right?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.576
It was a different Vienna.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.176
The United States was different.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.456
The world was different.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.776
There was a eugenics rising,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.136
and my grandparents realized,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.576
pretty quickly I think,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.120
that they were on the wrong side
of the eugenics equation.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.216
And so despite this being their home

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.296
and their whole extended family's home,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.656
and this area being their family's
home for generations,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.696
they decided because of eugenics

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.960
that they had to leave.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.816
And they survived,
but they were heartbroken,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.976
and I'm not sure my dad
ever really got over leaving Vienna.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.336
He left when he was just eight years old

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.560
in 1938.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.616
So today, I see a new eugenics

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.976
kind of bubbling to the surface.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.976
It's supposed to be a kinder,
gentler, positive eugenics,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.320
different than all that past stuff.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.576
But I think even though it's focused
on trying to improve people,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.296
it could have negative consequences,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.576
and it really worries me

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.376
that some of the top proponents
of this new eugenics,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.960
they think CRISPR is the ticket
to make it happen.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.096
So I have to admit, you know,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.376
eugenics, we talk
about making better people.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.656
It's a tough question.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.600
What is better when we're talking
about a human being?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.016
But I admit I think maybe a lot of us

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.976
could agree that human beings,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.976
maybe we could use a little betterment.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.296
Look at our politicians

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.376
here, you know, back in the US --

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.016
God forbid we go there right now.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.016
Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.576
there might be ways
we think we could be better.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.416
I might wish, honestly, that I had
more hair here, instead of baldness.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.976
Some people might wish they were taller,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.840
have a different weight, a different face.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.336
If we could do those things,
we could make those things happen,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.616
or we could make them happen
in our children,

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.440
it would be very seductive.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.936
And yet coming with it
would be these risks.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.856
I talked about eugenics,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.696
but there would be risks
to individuals as well.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.176
So if we forget about enhancing people

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.656
and we just try to make them
healthier using genetic modification,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.136
this technology is so new

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.736
and so powerful,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520
that by accident
we could make them sicker.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.656
That easily could happen.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.936
And there's another risk,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.536
and that is that all of the legitimate,
important genetic modification research

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.216
going on just in the lab --

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.256
again, no interest in designer babies --

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.136
a few people going
the designer baby route,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.536
things go badly,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.520
that entire field could be damaged.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.896
I also think it's not that unlikely

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.200
that governments might start taking
an interest in genetic modification.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.816
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.056
who is healthier,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.096
if there's a generation that looks
like they have lower health care costs,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.336
it's possible that governments
may start trying to compel their citizens

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.256
to go the GM route.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.296
Look at China's one-child policy.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.040
It's thought that that prevented
the birth of 400 million human beings.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.976
So it's not beyond the realm of possible

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.256
that genetic modification
could be something that governments push.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.776
And if designer babies become popular,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.616
in our digital age --

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.296
viral videos, social media --

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.896
what if designer babies
are thought to be fashionable,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.056
and they kind of become
the new glitterati,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.816
the new Kardashians or something?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.856
(Laughter)

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.416
You know, are those trends
that we really could control?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.520
I'm not convinced that we could.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.816
So again, today it's Halloween

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.296
and when we talk
about genetic modification,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.456
there's one Halloween-associated character

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.136
that is talked about
or invoked more than anything else,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.000
and that is Frankenstein.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.016
Mostly that's been Frankenfoods
and all this other stuff.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.616
But if we think about this now
and we think about it in the human context

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.896
on a day like Halloween,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.336
if parents can in essence
costume their children genetically,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.120
are we going to be talking about
a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.416
I don't think so. I don't think
it's going to get to that extreme.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.416
But when we are going about
hacking the human code,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.696
I think all bets are off
in terms of what might come of that.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.360
There would still be dangers.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.056
And we can look in the past

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.696
to other elements
of transformative science

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.536
and see how they can
basically go out of control

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.120
and permeate society.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.360
So I'll just give you one example,
and that is in vitro fertilization.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.096
Almost exactly 40 years ago,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.816
test tube baby number one
Louise Brown was born,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.096
and that's a great thing,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.656
and I think since then
five million IVF babies have been born,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.336
bringing immeasurable happiness.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.496
A lot of parents now can love those kids.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.576
But if you think about it,
in four decades,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.496
five million babies being born
from a new technology

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.336
is pretty remarkable,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.576
and the same kind of thing could happen

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.176
with human genetic modification
and designer babies.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.376
So depending on the decisions
we make in the next few months,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.696
the next year or so,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.856
if designer baby number one is born,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.096
within a few decades,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.776
there could well be millions
of genetically modified humans.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.256
And there's a difference there too,
because if we, you in the audience, or I,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.176
if we decide to have a designer baby,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.216
then their children will also
be genetically modified, and so on,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.536
because it's heritable.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.040
So that's a big difference.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.496
So with all of this in mind,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.080
what should we do?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.936
There's actually going to be a meeting

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.856
a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.816
by the US National Academy of Sciences

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.456
to tackle that exact question.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.160
What is the right path forward
with human genetic modification?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.416
I believe at this time

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.896
we need a moratorium.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.416
We have to ban this.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.016
We should not allow
creating genetically modified people,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.360
because it's just too dangerous
and too unpredictable.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.816
But there's a lot of people --

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.976
(Applause)

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.216
Thanks.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.640
(Applause)

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.176
And let me say, just as a scientist,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.696
it's a little bit scary
for me to say that in public,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.960
because science generally doesn't like
self-regulation and things like that.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.376
So I think we need to put a hold on this,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.136
but there are many people
who not only disagree with me,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.656
they feel the exact opposite.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.016
They're like, step on the gas,
full speed ahead,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.656
let's make designer babies.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.616
And so in the meeting in December

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.096
and other meetings that are likely
to follow in the next few months,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.256
it's very possible
there may be no moratorium.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.336
And I think part
of the problem that we have

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.416
is that all of this trend,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.536
this revolution in genetic modification
applying to humans,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.176
the public hasn't known about it.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.016
Nobody has been saying,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.096
look, this is a big deal,
this is a revolution,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.376
and this could affect you
in very personal ways.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.216
And so part of my goal
is actually to change that

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.176
and to educate and engage with the public

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.000
and get you guys talking about this.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.296
And so I hope at these meetings
that there will be a role for the public

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.840
to bring their voice to bear as well.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.240
So if we kind of circle back now
to 2030 again, that imagined story,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.216
and depending on the decisions
we make, again, today --

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.176
literally we don't have a lot of time --

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.296
in the next few months,
the next year or so,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.840
because this technology
is spreading like wildfire.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.496
Let's pretend we're back in that reality.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.336
We're at a park,

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.640
and our kid is swinging on the swing.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.215
Is that kid a regular old kid,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.695
or did we decide to have a designer baby?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.175
And let's say we went
the sort of traditional route,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.695
and there's our kid swinging on the swing,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.536
and frankly, they're kind of a mess.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.256
Their hair is all over
the place like mine.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.496
They have a stuffy nose.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.560
They're not the best student in the world.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.456
They're adorable, you love them,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.416
but there on the swing next to them,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.456
their best friend is a GM kid,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.896
and the two of them
are kind of swinging like this,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.936
and you can't help
but compare them, right?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.456
And the GM kid is swinging higher,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.656
they look better,
they're a better student,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.656
they don't have that stuffy nose
you need to wipe.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.936
How is that going to make you feel

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.680
and what decision
might you make next time?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.056
Thank you.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.997
(Applause)
