WEBVTT

00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:03.104
I want you to look
around the room for a minute

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.847
and try to find the most
paranoid person here --

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.935
(Laughter)

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.411
And then I want you to point
at that person for me.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:10.470
(Laughter)

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:11.853
OK, don't actually do it.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:12.996
(Laughter)

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.889
But, as an organizational psychologist,

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.795
I spend a lot of time in workplaces,

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:18.979
and I find paranoia everywhere.

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.941
Paranoia is caused by people
that I call "takers."

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.148
Takers are self-serving
in their interactions.

00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.433
It's all about what can you do for me.

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:28.233
The opposite is a giver.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.017
It's somebody who approaches
most interactions by asking,

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:32.641
"What can I do for you?"

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.036
I wanted to give you a chance
to think about your own style.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.013
We all have moments of giving and taking.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.053
Your style is how you treat
most of the people most of the time,

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:42.235
your default.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.801
I have a short test you can take

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:46.324
to figure out if you're more
of a giver or a taker,

00:00:46.348 --> 00:00:47.826
and you can take it right now.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.289
[The Narcissist Test]

00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:51.625
[Step 1: Take a moment
to think about yourself.]

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:52.752
(Laughter)

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.634
[Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
you are not a narcissist.]

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.217
(Laughter)

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:01.915
This is the only thing I will say today
that has no data behind it,

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.371
but I am convinced the longer it takes
for you to laugh at this cartoon,

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.822
the more worried we should be
that you're a taker.

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:08.911
(Laughter)

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.967
Of course, not all takers are narcissists.

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.879
Some are just givers who got burned
one too many times.

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:17.227
Then there's another kind of taker
that we won't be addressing today,

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.104
and that's called a psychopath.

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:20.279
(Laughter)

00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:23.175
I was curious, though, about how
common these extremes are,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.008
and so I surveyed over 30,000
people across industries

00:01:26.032 --> 00:01:27.644
around the world's cultures.

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.146
And I found that most people
are right in the middle

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.636
between giving and taking.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.005
They choose this third style
called "matching."

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:37.374
If you're a matcher, you try to keep
an even balance of give and take:

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:40.716
quid pro quo -- I'll do something
for you if you do something for me.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.121
And that seems like a safe way
to live your life.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.329
But is it the most effective
and productive way to live your life?

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.817
The answer to that question
is a very definitive ...

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.999
maybe.

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:51.249
(Laughter)

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:53.452
I studied dozens of organizations,

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:54.651
thousands of people.

00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:58.227
I had engineers measuring
their productivity.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.606
(Laughter)

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.599
I looked at medical students' grades --

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.598
even salespeople's revenue.

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:07.068
(Laughter)

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.744
And, unexpectedly,

00:02:08.768 --> 00:02:12.437
the worst performers in each
of these jobs were the givers.

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.793
The engineers who got the least work done

00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:17.323
were the ones who did more favors
than they got back.

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.483
They were so busy doing
other people's jobs,

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:23.057
they literally ran out of time and energy
to get their own work completed.

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:25.886
In medical school, the lowest grades
belong to the students

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.017
who agree most strongly
with statements like,

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.249
"I love helping others,"

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.292
which suggests the doctor
you ought to trust

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:36.395
is the one who came to med school
with no desire to help anybody.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.446
(Laughter)

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.828
And then in sales, too,
the lowest revenue accrued

00:02:39.852 --> 00:02:41.547
in the most generous salespeople.

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.001
I actually reached out
to one of those salespeople

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.632
who had a very high giver score.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.214
And I asked him, "Why do
you suck at your job --"

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:49.779
I didn't ask it that way, but --

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:50.847
(Laughter)

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.223
"What's the cost of generosity in sales?"

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:56.513
And he said, "Well, I just care
so deeply about my customers

00:02:56.537 --> 00:02:59.299
that I would never sell them
one of our crappy products."

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.724
(Laughter)

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:01.976
So just out of curiosity,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.284
how many of you self-identify more
as givers than takers or matchers?

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:06.458
Raise your hands.

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:09.911
OK, it would have been more
before we talked about these data.

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:14.152
But actually, it turns out
there's a twist here,

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:17.472
because givers are often
sacrificing themselves,

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.675
but they make their organizations better.

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.112
We have a huge body of evidence --

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.869
many, many studies looking
at the frequency of giving behavior

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:29.030
that exists in a team
or an organization --

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:32.140
and the more often people are helping
and sharing their knowledge

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:33.317
and providing mentoring,

00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.118
the better organizations do
on every metric we can measure:

00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:38.973
higher profits, customer satisfaction,
employee retention --

00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:40.842
even lower operating expenses.

00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:44.275
So givers spend a lot of time
trying to help other people

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.506
and improve the team,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.006
and then, unfortunately,
they suffer along the way.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.698
I want to talk about what it takes

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:53.043
to build cultures where givers
actually get to succeed.

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.584
So I wondered, then, if givers
are the worst performers,

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.436
who are the best performers?

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:02.088
Let me start with the good news:
it's not the takers.

00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:05.767
Takers tend to rise quickly
but also fall quickly in most jobs.

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.888
And they fall at the hands of matchers.

00:04:07.912 --> 00:04:11.332
If you're a matcher, you believe
in "An eye for an eye" -- a just world.

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.776
And so when you meet a taker,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.669
you feel like it's your mission in life

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:16.735
to just punish the hell
out of that person.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.773
(Laughter)

00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:19.422
And that way justice gets served.

00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:22.078
Well, most people are matchers.

00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:23.686
And that means if you're a taker,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.690
it tends to catch up with you eventually;

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.352
what goes around will come around.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:28.982
And so the logical conclusion is:

00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.871
it must be the matchers
who are the best performers.

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:33.413
But they're not.

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:36.287
In every job, in every organization
I've ever studied,

00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.473
the best results belong
to the givers again.

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.809
Take a look at some data I gathered
from hundreds of salespeople,

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:43.986
tracking their revenue.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.665
What you can see is that the givers
go to both extremes.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.907
They make up the majority of people
who bring in the lowest revenue,

00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:51.397
but also the highest revenue.

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.025
The same patterns were true
for engineers' productivity

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:55.440
and medical students' grades.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:58.071
Givers are overrepresented
at the bottom and at the top

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.177
of every success metric that I can track.

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:01.503
Which raises the question:

00:05:01.527 --> 00:05:04.936
How do we create a world
where more of these givers get to excel?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.783
I want to talk about how to do that,
not just in businesses,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.638
but also in nonprofits, schools --

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:10.955
even governments.

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.185
Are you ready?

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:13.395
(Cheers)

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.411
I was going to do it anyway,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:17.458
(Laughter)

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:19.326
The first thing that's really critical

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.097
is to recognize that givers
are your most valuable people,

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.555
but if they're not careful, they burn out.

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.069
So you have to protect
the givers in your midst.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:31.233
And I learned a great lesson about this
from Fortune's best networker.

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:34.343
It's the guy, not the cat.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.527
(Laughter)

00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.307
His name is Adam Rifkin.

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.543
He's a very successful serial entrepreneur

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:42.361
who spends a huge amount
of his time helping other people.

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.721
And his secret weapon
is the five-minute favor.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.920
Adam said, "You don't have to be
Mother Teresa or Gandhi

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.127
to be a giver.

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.654
You just have to find small ways
to add large value

00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.035
to other people's lives."

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.402
That could be as simple
as making an introduction

00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:58.357
between two people who could
benefit from knowing each other.

00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:01.718
It could be sharing your knowledge
or giving a little bit of feedback.

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:04.054
Or It might be even something
as basic as saying,

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:05.307
"You know,

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.831
I'm going to try and figure out

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:09.884
if I can recognize somebody
whose work has gone unnoticed."

00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.756
And those five-minute favors
are really critical

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.502
to helping givers set boundaries
and protect themselves.

00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:17.407
The second thing that matters

00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:19.899
if you want to build a culture
where givers succeed,

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:22.848
is you actually need a culture
where help-seeking is the norm;

00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:24.052
where people ask a lot.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.205
This may hit a little too close
to home for some of you.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.268
[So in all your relationships,
you always have to be the giver?]

00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:31.316
(Laughter)

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.071
What you see with successful givers

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:36.215
is they recognize that it's OK
to be a receiver, too.

00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:39.617
If you run an organization,
we can actually make this easier.

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:41.938
We can make it easier
for people to ask for help.

00:06:41.962 --> 00:06:44.034
A couple colleagues and I
studied hospitals.

00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:47.260
We found that on certain floors,
nurses did a lot of help-seeking,

00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:49.535
and on other floors,
they did very little of it.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.905
The factor that stood out on the floors
where help-seeking was common,

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:54.080
where it was the norm,

00:06:54.104 --> 00:06:56.479
was there was just one nurse
whose sole job it was

00:06:56.503 --> 00:06:58.534
to help other nurses on the unit.

00:06:58.558 --> 00:06:59.939
When that role was available,

00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:03.620
nurses said, "It's not embarrassing,
it's not vulnerable to ask for help --

00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:05.024
it's actually encouraged."

00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:09.089
Help-seeking isn't important
just for protecting the success

00:07:09.113 --> 00:07:10.512
and the well-being of givers.

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.468
It's also critical to getting
more people to act like givers,

00:07:13.492 --> 00:07:14.681
because the data say

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:18.105
that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
of all giving in organizations

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:19.407
starts with a request.

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:21.444
But a lot of people don't ask.

00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:23.216
They don't want to look incompetent,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.267
they don't know where to turn,
they don't want to burden others.

00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:28.000
Yet if nobody ever asks for help,

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:30.699
you have a lot of frustrated givers
in your organization

00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:32.706
who would love to step up and contribute,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.896
if they only knew
who could benefit and how.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.211
But I think the most important thing,

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.711
if you want to build a culture
of successful givers,

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:42.537
is to be thoughtful about who
you let onto your team.

00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.577
I figured, you want a culture
of productive generosity,

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:47.573
you should hire a bunch of givers.

00:07:47.597 --> 00:07:51.267
But I was surprised to discover, actually,
that that was not right --

00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:54.190
that the negative impact
of a taker on a culture

00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:57.083
is usually double to triple
the positive impact of a giver.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.680
Think about it this way:

00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:00.368
one bad apple can spoil a barrel,

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:03.218
but one good egg
just does not make a dozen.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.494
I don't know what that means --

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.637
(Laughter)

00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:08.034
But I hope you do.

00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:11.380
No -- let even one taker into a team,

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:14.258
and you will see that the givers
will stop helping.

00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:17.578
They'll say, "I'm surrounded
by a bunch of snakes and sharks.

00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:18.968
Why should I contribute?"

00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:20.968
Whereas if you let one giver into a team,

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:23.114
you don't get an explosion of generosity.

00:08:23.138 --> 00:08:24.559
More often, people are like,

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:26.721
"Great! That person can do all our work."

00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:29.823
So, effective hiring and screening
and team building

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:31.983
is not about bringing in the givers;

00:08:32.007 --> 00:08:34.221
it's about weeding out the takers.

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:36.187
If you can do that well,

00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.153
you'll be left with givers and matchers.

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:39.542
The givers will be generous

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:42.200
because they don't have to worry
about the consequences.

00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:45.337
And the beauty of the matchers
is that they follow the norm.

00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:48.129
So how do you catch a taker
before it's too late?

00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:51.632
We're actually pretty bad
at figuring out who's a taker,

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.482
especially on first impressions.

00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:55.814
There's a personality trait
that throws us off.

00:08:55.838 --> 00:08:57.143
It's called agreeableness,

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.788
one the major dimensions
of personality across cultures.

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:03.297
Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
they're nice, they're polite.

00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:05.112
You find a lot of them in Canada --

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:06.739
(Laughter)

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:10.260
Where there was actually
a national contest

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.314
to come up with a new Canadian slogan
and fill in the blank,

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:14.913
"As Canadian as ..."

00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:17.021
I thought the winning entry
was going to be,

00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.516
"As Canadian as maple syrup,"
or, "... ice hockey."

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.525
But no, Canadians voted
for their new national slogan to be --

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:23.710
I kid you not --

00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:26.165
"As Canadian as possible
under the circumstances."

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:29.402
(Laughter)

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.391
Now for those of you
who are highly agreeable,

00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:33.808
or maybe slightly Canadian,

00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:35.205
you get this right away.

00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:37.046
How could I ever say I'm any one thing

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.896
when I'm constantly adapting
to try to please other people?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.223
Disagreeable people do less of it.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:45.184
They're more critical,
skeptical, challenging,

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:48.262
and far more likely than their peers
to go to law school.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.429
(Laughter)

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:52.108
That's not a joke,
that's actually an empirical fact.

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.191
(Laughter)

00:09:53.215 --> 00:09:55.764
So I always assumed
that agreeable people were givers

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:57.735
and disagreeable people were takers.

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.189
But then I gathered the data,

00:09:59.213 --> 00:10:02.326
and I was stunned to find
no correlation between those traits,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.009
because it turns out
that agreeableness-disagreeableness

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:06.196
is your outer veneer:

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.161
How pleasant is it to interact with you?

00:10:08.185 --> 00:10:10.877
Whereas giving and taking
are more of your inner motives:

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.793
What are your values?
What are your intentions toward others?

00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:16.009
If you really want to judge
people accurately,

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:19.550
you have to get to the moment every
consultant in the room is waiting for,

00:10:19.574 --> 00:10:20.739
and draw a two-by-two.

00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:22.861
(Laughter)

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:27.655
The agreeable givers are easy to spot:

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:30.313
they say yes to everything.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.613
The disagreeable takers
are also recognized quickly,

00:10:34.637 --> 00:10:38.544
although you might call them
by a slightly different name.

00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:40.432
(Laughter)

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:43.900
We forget about the other
two combinations.

00:10:43.924 --> 00:10:47.259
There are disagreeable givers
in our organizations.

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:49.924
There are people who are gruff
and tough on the surface

00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:52.486
but underneath have
others' best interests at heart.

00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:54.452
Or as an engineer put it,

00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:56.082
"Oh, disagreeable givers --

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:59.982
like somebody with a bad user interface
but a great operating system."

00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:01.292
(Laughter)

00:11:01.316 --> 00:11:02.687
If that helps you.

00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:03.861
(Laughter)

00:11:04.424 --> 00:11:07.927
Disagreeable givers are the most
undervalued people in our organizations,

00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:10.543
because they're the ones
who give the critical feedback

00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:13.173
that no one wants to hear
but everyone needs to hear.

00:11:13.197 --> 00:11:15.685
We need to do a much better job
valuing these people

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.497
as opposed to writing them off early,

00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.265
and saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:20.786
must be a selfish taker."

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:24.608
The other combination we forget about
is the deadly one --

00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:27.314
the agreeable taker,
also known as the faker.

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:30.509
This is the person
who's nice to your face,

00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:32.513
and then will stab you right in the back.

00:11:32.537 --> 00:11:33.869
(Laughter)

00:11:34.537 --> 00:11:37.771
And my favorite way to catch
these people in the interview process

00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:39.067
is to ask the question,

00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:41.053
"Can you give me the names of four people

00:11:41.077 --> 00:11:43.446
whose careers you have
fundamentally improved?"

00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:46.317
The takers will give you four names,

00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:49.038
and they will all be more
influential than them,

00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:52.264
because takers are great at kissing up
and then kicking down.

00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:56.357
Givers are more likely to name people
who are below them in a hierarchy,

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.927
who don't have as much power,

00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.323
who can do them no good.

00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:02.897
And let's face it, you all know
you can learn a lot about character

00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:05.476
by watching how someone
treats their restaurant server

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.663
or their Uber driver.

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:08.585
So if we do all this well,

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:10.693
if we can weed takers
out of organizations,

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:12.629
if we can make it safe to ask for help,

00:12:12.653 --> 00:12:14.667
if we can protect givers from burnout

00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:17.918
and make it OK for them to be ambitious
in pursuing their own goals

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.098
as well as trying to help other people,

00:12:20.122 --> 00:12:23.029
we can actually change the way
that people define success.

00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:26.405
Instead of saying it's all about
winning a competition,

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:29.969
people will realize success
is really more about contribution.

00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:33.122
I believe that the most
meaningful way to succeed

00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:35.016
is to help other people succeed.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.711
And if we can spread that belief,

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:39.386
we can actually turn paranoia upside down.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.573
There's a name for that.

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.033
It's called "pronoia."

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:44.722
Pronoia is the delusional belief

00:12:44.746 --> 00:12:47.346
that other people
are plotting your well-being.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.893
(Laughter)

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.461
That they're going around behind your back

00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:56.401
and saying exceptionally
glowing things about you.

00:12:57.647 --> 00:13:01.456
The great thing about a culture of givers
is that's not a delusion --

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.714
it's reality.

00:13:03.697 --> 00:13:06.273
I want to live in a world
where givers succeed,

00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:08.619
and I hope you will help me
create that world.

00:13:08.643 --> 00:13:09.864
Thank you.

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:15.174
(Applause)
