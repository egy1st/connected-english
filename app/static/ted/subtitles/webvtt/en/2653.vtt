00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:02.866
Growing up in Kenya,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.441
I knew I always wanted
to study biochemistry.

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:12.619
See, I had seen the impact of the high
prevalence of diseases like malaria,

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:15.336
and I wanted to make medicines
that would cure the sick.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.150
So I worked really hard,

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:20.961
got a scholarship to the United States,
where I became a cancer researcher,

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:22.214
and I loved it.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.699
For someone who wants to cure diseases,

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.434
there is no higher calling.

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.673
Ten years later, I returned
to Kenya to do just that.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.162
A freshly minted PhD,

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:35.387
ready to take on this horrific illness,

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:38.322
which in Kenya was almost
certainly a death sentence.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.552
But instead of landing a job
in a pharmaceutical company

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.465
or a hospital,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.861
I found myself drawn
to a different kind of lab,

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.742
working with a different
kind of patient --

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.120
a patient whose illness was so serious

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:55.029
it impacted every single
person in my country;

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:57.958
a patient who needed to get healthy fast.

00:00:58.328 --> 00:01:00.731
That patient was my government.

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:03.276
(Laughter)

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:07.704
See, many of us will agree that lots
of governments are unhealthy today.

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:10.959
(Laughter)

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:15.617
(Applause)

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.556
And Kenya was no exception.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:21.478
When I returned to Kenya in 2014,

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.206
there was 17 percent youth unemployment.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.133
And Nairobi, the major business hub,

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:31.232
was rated 177th on the quality
of living index.

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:32.460
It was bad.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.729
Now, an economy is only as healthy
as the entities that make it up.

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:40.337
So when government --

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.106
one of its most vital entities --

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.568
is weak or unhealthy,

00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:45.575
everyone and everything suffers.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.295
Sometimes you might
put a Band-Aid in place

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.831
to try and temporarily stop the pain.

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:54.714
Maybe some of you here have participated

00:01:54.738 --> 00:01:57.717
in a Band-Aid operation
to an African country --

00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:02.223
setting up alternative schools,
building hospitals, digging wells --

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:05.184
because governments there
either weren't or couldn't provide

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.177
the services to their citizens.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.709
We all know this is a temporary solution.

00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:14.240
There are just some things
Band-Aids can't fix,

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:19.416
like providing an environment
where businesses feel secure

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.251
that they'll have an equal opportunity

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.517
to be able to run and start
their businesses successfully.

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:26.355
Or there are systems in place

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.420
that would protect the private
property that they create.

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:30.601
I would argue,

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:34.069
only government is capable of creating
these necessary conditions

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:35.744
for economies to thrive.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.387
Economies thrive when business are able
to quickly and easily set up shop.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.783
Business owners create new sources
of income for themselves,

00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:47.258
new jobs get added into the economy

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:50.846
and then more taxes are paid
to fund public projects.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.967
New business is good for everyone.

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:57.245
And it's such an important measure
of economic growth,

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.220
the World Bank has a ranking called
the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:04.281
which measures how easy
or difficult it is to start a business

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.902
in any given country.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.545
And as you can imagine,

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:12.025
starting or running a business
in a country with an ailing government --

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.498
almost impossible.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:18.156
The President of Kenya knew this,
which is why in 2014,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.549
he came to our lab and asked
us to partner with him

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.843
to be able to help Kenya
to jump-start business growth.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.411
He set an ambitious goal:

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:32.700
he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50
in this World Bank ranking.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.244
In 2014 when he came,

00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:39.594
Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:42.227
We had our work cut out for us.

00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:46.293
Fortunately, he came to the right place.

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:48.644
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.

00:03:48.668 --> 00:03:52.434
We're a group of computer scientists,
mathematicians, engineers

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.395
and a cancer researcher,

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.865
who understood that in order
to cure the sickness

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.963
of a system as big as government,

00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:01.387
we needed to examine the whole body,

00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:04.498
and then we needed to drill down
all the way from the organs,

00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:05.855
into the tissues,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.381
all the way to single cells,

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.742
so that we could properly
make a diagnosis.

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:13.593
So with our marching orders
from the President himself,

00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:16.730
we embarked on the purest
of the scientific method:

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.929
collecting data --

00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:20.040
all the data we could get our hands on --

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:21.321
making hypotheses,

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:22.582
creating solutions,

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:23.798
one after the other.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:28.880
So we met with hundreds of individuals
who worked at government agencies,

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:32.840
from the tax agency, the lands
office, utilities company,

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:36.332
the agency that's responsible
for registering companies,

00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:39.955
and with each of them, we observed
them as they served customers,

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.592
we documented their processes --
most of them were manual.

00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:48.929
We also just went back and looked at
a lot of their previous paperwork

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:51.121
to try and really understand;

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.495
to try and diagnose what bodily
malfunctions had occurred

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.827
that lead to that 136th spot
on the World Bank list.

00:04:58.248 --> 00:04:59.551
What did we find?

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:04.045
Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.013
for a business owner
to register their property,

00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:09.434
compared to just one day in New Zealand,

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.836
which was ranked second
on the World Bank list.

00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:17.212
It took 158 days to get
a new electric connection.

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.311
In Korea it took 18 days.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:23.037
If you wanted to get a construction permit

00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:24.581
so you could put up a building,

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:28.176
in Kenya, it was going
to take you 125 days.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.646
In Singapore, which is ranked first,
that would only take you 26 days.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.624
God forbid you had to go to court

00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:39.535
to get help in being able to settle
a dispute to enforce a contract,

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.840
because that process alone
would take you 465 days.

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:46.997
And if that wasn't bad enough,

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:52.827
you would lose 40 percent
of your claim in just fees --

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:55.723
legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.

00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:59.181
Now, I know what you're thinking:

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:04.393
for there to exist such inefficiencies
in an African country,

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.777
there must be corruption.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.967
The very cells that run the show
must be corrupt to the bone.

00:06:10.972 --> 00:06:12.504
I thought so, too, actually.

00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:14.137
When we started out,

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:17.649
I thought I was going to find
so much corruption,

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:21.169
I was literally going to either die
or get killed in the process.

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:22.736
(Laughter)

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.901
But when we dug deeper,

00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:29.560
we didn't find corruption
in the classic sense:

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.114
slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:35.455
waiting to grease the palms
of their friends.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.125
What we found was an overwhelming
sense of helplessness.

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:42.946
Our government was sick,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.494
because government
employees felt helpless.

00:06:46.993 --> 00:06:50.076
They felt that they were not
empowered to drive change.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.236
And when people feel stuck and helpless,

00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:57.463
they stop seeing their role
in a bigger system.

00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:02.734
They start to think the work they do
doesn't matter in driving change.

00:07:02.758 --> 00:07:04.564
And when that happens,

00:07:04.588 --> 00:07:06.181
things slow down,

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:07.625
fall through the cracks

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.415
and inefficiencies flourish.

00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.936
Now imagine with me,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.898
if you had a process
you had to go through --

00:07:16.922 --> 00:07:18.692
had no other alternative --

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:21.763
and this process was inefficient, complex

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.851
and very, very slow.

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:25.099
What would you do?

00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:29.810
I think you might start by trying
to find somebody to outsource it to,

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:32.179
so that they can just
take care of that for you.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.204
If that doesn't work,

00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:37.317
maybe you'd consider paying somebody

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:40.721
to just "unofficially" take care
of it on your behalf --

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:43.503
especially if you thought
nobody was going to catch you.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.160
Not out of malice or greed,

00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:50.275
just trying to make sure that you get
something to work for you

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:51.457
so you can move on.

00:07:51.918 --> 00:07:54.928
Unfortunately, that
is the beginning of corruption.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:57.762
And if left to thrive and grow,

00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.352
it seeps into the whole system,

00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:00.746
and before you know it,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.335
the whole body is sick.

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:05.889
Knowing this,

00:08:05.913 --> 00:08:07.468
we had to start by making sure

00:08:07.492 --> 00:08:12.069
that every single stakeholder
we worked with had a shared vision

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:13.522
for what we wanted to do.

00:08:14.192 --> 00:08:16.226
So we met with everyone,

00:08:16.656 --> 00:08:19.215
from the clerk whose sole job
is to remove staples

00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:20.788
from application packets,

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:24.431
to the legal drafters
at the attorney general's office,

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:28.184
to the clerks who are responsible
for serving business owners

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.640
when they came to access
government services.

00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:32.707
And with them,

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.303
we made sure that they understood

00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:39.074
how their day-to-day actions
were impacting our ability as a country

00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:42.173
to create new jobs
and to attract investments.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:46.165
No one's role was too small;
everyone's role was vital.

00:08:48.087 --> 00:08:49.962
Now, guess what we started to see?

00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:53.007
A coalition of government employees

00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:55.143
who are excited and ready to drive change,

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.232
began to grow and form.

00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:00.531
And together we started
to implement changes

00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:03.787
that impacted the service
delivery of our country.

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.009
The result?

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:08.074
In just two years,

00:09:08.098 --> 00:09:12.058
Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:18.984
(Applause)

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.909
And in recognition of the significant
reforms we've been able to implement

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:26.712
in such a short time,

00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:28.617
Kenya was recognized

00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:32.227
to be among the top three
global reformers in the world

00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.667
two years in a row.

00:09:34.698 --> 00:09:40.078
(Applause)

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.730
Are we fully healthy?

00:09:43.556 --> 00:09:44.722
No.

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:47.581
We have some serious work still to do.

00:09:48.336 --> 00:09:51.813
I like to think about these two years
like a weight-loss program.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.751
(Laughter)

00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:58.483
It's that time after months
of hard, grueling work at the gym,

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.937
and then you get your first
time to weigh yourself,

00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:02.625
and you've lost 20 pounds.

00:10:03.007 --> 00:10:04.789
You're feeling unstoppable.

00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:11.034
Now, some of you may think
this doesn't apply to you.

00:10:11.058 --> 00:10:12.408
You're not from Kenya.

00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:14.574
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.

00:10:14.598 --> 00:10:16.560
But think with me for just a moment.

00:10:17.314 --> 00:10:20.766
When is the last time
you accessed a government service?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.756
Maybe applied for your driver's license,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.348
tried to do your taxes on your own.

00:10:30.644 --> 00:10:33.414
It's easy in this political
and global economy

00:10:33.438 --> 00:10:36.488
to want to give up when we think
about transforming government.

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:40.887
We can easily resign to the fact
or to the thinking

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:43.253
that government is too inefficient,

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:44.433
too corrupt,

00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:45.688
unfixable.

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:49.964
We might even rarely get
some key government responsibilities

00:10:49.988 --> 00:10:51.188
to other sectors,

00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:52.381
to Band-Aid solutions,

00:10:52.405 --> 00:10:54.973
or to just give up and feel helpless.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:59.912
But just because a system is sick
doesn't mean it's dying.

00:11:00.689 --> 00:11:03.496
We cannot afford to give up

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.553
when it comes to the challenges
of fixing our governments.

00:11:07.989 --> 00:11:09.145
In the end,

00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:14.857
what really makes a government healthy
is when healthy cells --

00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.872
that's you and I --

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:19.481
get to the ground,

00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:20.789
roll up our sleeves,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.918
refuse to be helpless

00:11:22.942 --> 00:11:24.738
and believe that sometimes,

00:11:24.762 --> 00:11:27.992
all it takes is for us
to create some space

00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:30.231
for healthy cells to grow and thrive.

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:31.938
Thank you.

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:38.201
(Applause)
