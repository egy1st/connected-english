00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:05.272
There is something about physics

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:09.296
that has been really bothering me
since I was a little kid.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.819
And it's related to a question

00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:16.087
that scientists have been asking
for almost 100 years,

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.280
with no answer.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:22.118
How do the smallest things in nature,

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:24.295
the particles of the quantum world,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.350
match up with the largest
things in nature --

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:30.621
planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.023
As a kid, I would puzzle
over questions just like this.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.939
I would fiddle around
with microscopes and electromagnets,

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.158
and I would read
about the forces of the small

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:40.516
and about quantum mechanics

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.104
and I would marvel at how well
that description matched up

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:45.298
to our observation.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.803
Then I would look at the stars,

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.351
and I would read about how well
we understand gravity,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.725
and I would think surely,
there must be some elegant way

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.394
that these two systems match up.

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:58.422
But there's not.

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:00.833
And the books would say,

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:04.040
yeah, we understand a lot
about these two realms separately,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.674
but when we try to link
them mathematically,

00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:08.028
everything breaks.

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:09.984
And for 100 years,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:15.036
none of our ideas as to how to solve
this basically physics disaster,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.874
has ever been supported by evidence.

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.925
And to little old me --

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:21.759
little, curious, skeptical James --

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:24.651
this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.244
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:32.078
Flash-forward now
to December of 2015,

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.503
when I found myself smack in the middle

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:38.467
of the physics world
being flipped on its head.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.319
It all started when we at CERN
saw something intriguing in our data:

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:45.617
a hint of a new particle,

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:49.857
an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
answer to this question.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.904
So I'm still a skeptical
little kid, I think,

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:56.061
but I'm also now a particle hunter.

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.548
I am a physicist at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.043
the largest science
experiment ever mounted.

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:07.412
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel
on the border of France and Switzerland

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.286
buried 100 meters underground.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.464
And in this tunnel,

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:14.441
we use superconducting magnets
colder than outer space

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.526
to accelerate protons
to almost the speed of light

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.427
and slam them into each other
millions of times per second,

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.277
collecting the debris of these collisions

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:28.272
to search for new, undiscovered
fundamental particles.

00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:31.191
Its design and construction
took decades of work

00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:34.247
by thousands of physicists
from around the globe,

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:36.812
and in the summer of 2015,

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:40.260
we had been working tirelessly
to switch on the LHC

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:44.751
at the highest energy that humans
have ever used in a collider experiment.

00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:48.258
Now, higher energy is important

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.469
because for particles,
there is an equivalence

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:52.694
between energy and particle mass,

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:55.179
and mass is just a number
put there by nature.

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:57.386
To discover new particles,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.532
we need to reach these bigger numbers.

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:02.810
And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.399
and the biggest, highest
energy collider in the world

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.889
is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:13.170
And then, we collide protons
quadrillions of times,

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:17.478
and we collect this data very slowly,
over months and months.

00:03:18.813 --> 00:03:23.148
And then new particles might show up
in our data as bumps --

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:25.617
slight deviations from what you expect,

00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:29.608
little clusters of data points
that make a smooth line not so smooth.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.100
For example, this bump,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.543
after months of data-taking in 2012,

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.696
led to the discovery
of the Higgs particle --

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.925
the Higgs boson --

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.314
and to a Nobel Prize
for the confirmation of its existence.

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:47.530
This jump up in energy in 2015

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:51.920
represented the best chance
that we as a species had ever had

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.421
of discovering new particles --

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:55.557
new answers to these
long-standing questions,

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:58.678
because it was almost
twice as much energy as we used

00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.624
when we discovered the Higgs boson.

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:04.389
Many of my colleagues had been working
their entire careers for this moment,

00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:06.489
and frankly, to little curious me,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.423
this was the moment
I'd been waiting for my entire life.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:11.178
So 2015 was go time.

00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:14.864
So June 2015,

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.381
the LHC is switched back on.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.917
My colleagues and I held our breath
and bit our fingernails,

00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:24.452
and then finally we saw
the first proton collisions

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:26.432
at this highest energy ever.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.532
Applause, champagne, celebration.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:32.152
This was a milestone for science,

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:36.798
and we had no idea what we would find
in this brand-new data.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.168
And then a few weeks later,
we found a bump.

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:45.868
It wasn't a very big bump,

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.464
but it was big enough to make
you raise your eyebrow.

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:51.739
But on a scale of one to 10
for eyebrow raises,

00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:54.373
if 10 indicates that you've
discovered a new particle,

00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:56.124
this eyebrow raise is about a four.

00:04:56.148 --> 00:04:57.298
(Laughter)

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:03.643
I spent hours, days, weeks
in secret meetings,

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.027
arguing with my colleagues
over this little bump,

00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.287
poking and prodding it with our most
ruthless experimental sticks

00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.288
to see if it would withstand scrutiny.

00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:15.449
But even after months
of working feverishly --

00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:17.905
sleeping in our offices
and not going home,

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.006
candy bars for dinner,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.600
coffee by the bucketful --

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:25.867
physicists are machines
for turning coffee into diagrams --

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:27.290
(Laughter)

00:05:27.314 --> 00:05:29.850
This little bump would not go away.

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:32.842
So after a few months,

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.576
we presented our little bump to the world
with a very clear message:

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:40.168
this little bump is interesting
but it's not definitive,

00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:43.521
so let's keep an eye on it
as we take more data.

00:05:43.872 --> 00:05:46.163
So we were trying to be
extremely cool about it.

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:49.651
And the world ran with it anyway.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.015
The news loved it.

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:55.290
People said it reminded
them of the little bump

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:58.737
that was shown on the way
toward the Higgs boson discovery.

00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.889
Better than that,
my theorist colleagues --

00:06:02.548 --> 00:06:04.865
I love my theorist colleagues --

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.501
my theorist colleagues wrote
500 papers about this little bump.

00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:09.980
(Laughter)

00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:14.540
The world of particle physics
had been flipped on its head.

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:19.987
But what was it about this particular bump

00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:24.101
that caused thousands of physicists
to collectively lose their cool?

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.032
This little bump was unique.

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:29.567
This little bump indicated

00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.613
that we were seeing an unexpectedly
large number of collisions

00:06:32.637 --> 00:06:35.968
whose debris consisted
of only two photons,

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:37.236
two particles of light.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.497
And that's rare.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.689
Particle collisions are not
like automobile collisions.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.232
They have different rules.

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:45.906
When two particles collide
at almost the speed of light,

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.351
the quantum world takes over.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.635
And in the quantum world,

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.852
these two particles
can briefly create a new particle

00:06:51.876 --> 00:06:54.656
that lives for a tiny fraction of a second

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.561
before splitting into other particles
that hit our detector.

00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.990
Imagine a car collision
where the two cars vanish upon impact,

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:03.283
a bicycle appears in their place --

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:04.378
(Laughter)

00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:06.863
And then that bicycle explodes
into two skateboards,

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.068
which hit our detector.

00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:09.471
(Laughter)

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.448
Hopefully, not literally.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.814
They're very expensive.

00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:17.939
Events where only two photons
hit out detector are very rare.

00:07:17.963 --> 00:07:21.685
And because of the special
quantum properties of photons,

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:25.497
there's a very small number
of possible new particles --

00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.018
these mythical bicycles --

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.285
that can give birth to only two photons.

00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:32.648
But one of these options is huge,

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:35.508
and it has to do with
that long-standing question

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:38.054
that bothered me as a tiny little kid,

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:39.438
about gravity.

00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:44.618
Gravity may seem super strong to you,

00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:48.742
but it's actually crazily weak
compared to the other forces of nature.

00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:51.397
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.233
but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.

00:07:56.463 --> 00:07:59.679
The strength of gravity compared
to the other forces of nature?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.670
It's 10 to the minus 39.

00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:05.231
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:06.412
Worse than that,

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:09.463
all of the other known forces of nature
are perfectly described

00:08:09.487 --> 00:08:11.524
by this thing we call the Standard Model,

00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:14.983
which is our current best description
of nature at its smallest scales,

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:16.163
and quite frankly,

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:20.364
one of the most successful
achievements of humankind --

00:08:20.388 --> 00:08:24.400
except for gravity, which is absent
from the Standard Model.

00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:25.574
It's crazy.

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:29.146
It's almost as though most
of gravity has gone missing.

00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:32.061
We feel a little bit of it,

00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:33.761
but where's the rest of it?

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:35.067
No one knows.

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:40.406
But one theoretical explanation
proposes a wild solution.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.459
You and I --

00:08:43.483 --> 00:08:45.061
even you in the back --

00:08:45.085 --> 00:08:47.230
we live in three dimensions of space.

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:49.811
I hope that's a
non-controversial statement.

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:51.664
(Laughter)

00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:55.126
All of the known particles also live
in three dimensions of space.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.340
In fact, a particle is just another name

00:08:57.364 --> 00:09:00.373
for an excitation
in a three-dimensional field;

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.317
a localized wobbling in space.

00:09:03.288 --> 00:09:06.817
More importantly, all the math
that we use to describe all this stuff

00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.914
assumes that there are only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:13.319
But math is math, and we can play
around with our math however we want.

00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:16.509
And people have been playing around
with extra dimensions of space

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:17.688
for a very long time,

00:09:17.712 --> 00:09:20.297
but it's always been an abstract
mathematical concept.

00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:23.493
I mean, just look around you --
you at the back, look around --

00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:25.798
there's clearly only
three dimensions of space.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:28.513
But what if that's not true?

00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:36.364
What if the missing gravity is leaking
into an extra-spatial dimension

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.344
that's invisible to you and I?

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:42.449
What if gravity is just as strong
as the other forces

00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:45.614
if you were to view it in this
extra-spatial dimension,

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:48.538
and what you and I experience
is a tiny slice of gravity

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:50.459
make it seem very weak?

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.333
If this were true,

00:09:53.357 --> 00:09:56.105
we would have to expand
our Standard Model of particles

00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:00.215
to include an extra particle,
a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.234
a special graviton that lives
in extra-spatial dimensions.

00:10:03.258 --> 00:10:04.723
I see the looks on your faces.

00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:06.566
You should be asking me the question,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.234
"How in the world are we going to test
this crazy, science fiction idea,

00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:12.749
stuck as we are in three dimensions?"

00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:14.055
The way we always do,

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.218
by slamming together two protons --

00:10:16.242 --> 00:10:17.394
(Laughter)

00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:19.982
Hard enough that
the collision reverberates

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:22.697
into any extra-spatial dimensions
that might be there,

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.320
momentarily creating
this hyperdimensional graviton

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:29.724
that then snaps back
into the three dimensions of the LHC

00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:31.570
and spits off two photons,

00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:33.616
two particles of light.

00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:38.327
And this hypothetical,
extra-dimensional graviton

00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:42.058
is one of the only possible,
hypothetical new particles

00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:44.217
that has the special quantum properties

00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:48.477
that could give birth to our little,
two-photon bump.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.820
So, the possibility of explaining
the mysteries of gravity

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:59.342
and of discovering extra
dimensions of space --

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:00.958
perhaps now you get a sense

00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:05.106
as to why thousands of physics geeks
collectively lost their cool

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.012
over our little, two-photon bump.

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:09.936
A discovery of this type
would rewrite the textbooks.

00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:11.891
But remember,

00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:13.639
the message from us experimentalists

00:11:13.663 --> 00:11:15.902
that actually were doing
this work at the time,

00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:17.080
was very clear:

00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:18.278
we need more data.

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:19.821
With more data,

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:23.869
the little bump will either turn into
a nice, crisp Nobel Prize --

00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:25.653
(Laughter)

00:11:25.677 --> 00:11:28.641
Or the extra data will fill in
the space around the bump

00:11:28.665 --> 00:11:30.531
and turn it into a nice, smooth line.

00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:32.733
So we took more data,

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:35.334
and with five times the data,
several months later,

00:11:35.358 --> 00:11:37.048
our little bump

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.420
turned into a smooth line.

00:11:43.217 --> 00:11:46.701
The news reported on a "huge
disappointment," on "faded hopes,"

00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:49.235
and on particle physicists "being sad."

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.070
Given the tone of the coverage,

00:11:51.094 --> 00:11:54.582
you'd think that we had decided
to shut down the LHC and go home.

00:11:54.606 --> 00:11:55.756
(Laughter)

00:11:56.628 --> 00:11:58.231
But that's not what we did.

00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:03.071
But why not?

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.320
I mean, if I didn't discover
a particle -- and I didn't --

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:11.238
if I didn't discover a particle,
why am I here talking to you?

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:13.699
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame

00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:14.947
and go home?

00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:22.520
Particle physicists are explorers.

00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:26.373
And very much of what we do
is cartography.

00:12:27.468 --> 00:12:30.320
Let me put it this way: forget
about the LHC for a second.

00:12:30.344 --> 00:12:33.726
Imagine you are a space explorer
arriving at a distant planet,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.075
searching for aliens.

00:12:35.099 --> 00:12:36.621
What is your first task?

00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.007
To immediately orbit the planet,
land, take a quick look around

00:12:41.031 --> 00:12:42.917
for any big, obvious signs of life,

00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:44.760
and report back to home base.

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:46.408
That's the stage we're at now.

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:48.756
We took a first look at the LHC

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.064
for any new, big,
obvious-to-spot particles,

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:53.038
and we can report that there are none.

00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:56.304
We saw a weird-looking alien bump
on a distant mountain,

00:12:56.328 --> 00:12:58.498
but once we got closer,
we saw it was a rock.

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.456
But then what do we do?
Do we just give up and fly away?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.767
Absolutely not;

00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:05.096
we would be terrible scientists if we did.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.733
No, we spend the next couple
of decades exploring,

00:13:08.757 --> 00:13:10.237
mapping out the territory,

00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:12.626
sifting through the sand
with a fine instrument,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.108
peeking under every stone,

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:15.686
drilling under the surface.

00:13:16.106 --> 00:13:18.699
New particles can either
show up immediately

00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:20.856
as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.821
or they can only reveal themselves
after years of data taking.

00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:30.513
Humanity has just begun its exploration
at the LHC at this big high energy,

00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:32.328
and we have much searching to do.

00:13:32.352 --> 00:13:38.177
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,
we still find no new particles?

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:40.748
We build a bigger machine.

00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:42.346
(Laughter)

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.060
We search at higher energies.

00:13:44.476 --> 00:13:46.046
We search at higher energies.

00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:49.999
Planning is already underway
for a 100-kilometer tunnel

00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:53.588
that will collide particles
at 10 times the energy of the LHC.

00:13:53.612 --> 00:13:55.949
We don't decide where
nature places new particles.

00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:58.012
We only decide to keep exploring.

00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.594
But what if, even after
a 100-kilometer tunnel

00:14:00.618 --> 00:14:02.478
or a 500-kilometer tunnel

00:14:02.502 --> 00:14:05.343
or a 10,000-kilometer
collider floating in space

00:14:05.367 --> 00:14:06.945
between the Earth and the Moon,

00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:10.031
we still find no new particles?

00:14:11.597 --> 00:14:14.291
Then perhaps we're doing
particle physics wrong.

00:14:14.315 --> 00:14:16.106
(Laughter)

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.087
Perhaps we need to rethink things.

00:14:19.127 --> 00:14:22.389
Maybe we need more resources,
technology, expertise

00:14:22.413 --> 00:14:23.921
than what we currently have.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.951
We already use artificial intelligence
and machine learning techniques

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.128
in parts of the LHC,

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.558
but imagine designing
a particle physics experiment

00:14:31.582 --> 00:14:33.251
using such sophisticated algorithms

00:14:33.275 --> 00:14:36.443
that it could teach itself to discover
a hyperdimensional graviton.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:37.624
But what if?

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:39.093
What if the ultimate question:

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:42.590
What if even artificial intelligence
can't help us answer our questions?

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:44.725
What if these open questions,
for centuries,

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:47.418
are destined to be unanswered
for the foreseeable future?

00:14:47.442 --> 00:14:50.371
What if the stuff that's bothered me
since I was a little kid

00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:52.918
is destined to be unanswered
in my lifetime?

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:55.551
Then that ...

00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.376
will be even more fascinating.

00:15:00.144 --> 00:15:03.369
We will be forced to think
in completely new ways.

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.419
We'll have to go back to our assumptions,

00:15:06.443 --> 00:15:08.782
and determine if there was
a flaw somewhere.

00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:12.796
And we'll need to encourage more people
to join us in studying science

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.882
since we need fresh eyes
on these century-old problems.

00:15:15.906 --> 00:15:19.040
I don't have the answers,
and I'm still searching for them.

00:15:19.064 --> 00:15:21.393
But someone -- maybe
she's in school right now,

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:23.101
maybe she's not even born yet --

00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:26.916
could eventually guide us to see physics
in a completely new way,

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.208
and to point out that perhaps
we're just asking the wrong questions.

00:15:32.112 --> 00:15:34.522
Which would not be the end of physics,

00:15:34.546 --> 00:15:35.952
but a novel beginning.

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:38.354
Thank you.

00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:40.919
(Applause)
