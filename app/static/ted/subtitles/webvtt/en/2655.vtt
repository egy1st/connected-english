00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.071
Here's a startling fact:

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:06.816
in the 45 years since the introduction
of the automated teller machine,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.696
those vending machines that dispense cash,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.896
the number of human bank tellers
employed in the United States

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.176
has roughly doubled,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.496
from about a quarter of a million
to a half a million.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.556
A quarter of a million in 1970
to about a half a million today,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.816
with 100,000 added since the year 2000.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.256
These facts, revealed in a recent book

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.416
by Boston University
economist James Bessen,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.616
raise an intriguing question:

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.536
what are all those tellers doing,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.576
and why hasn't automation
eliminated their employment by now?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.936
If you think about it,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.096
many of the great inventions
of the last 200 years

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.920
were designed to replace human labor.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.496
Tractors were developed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.856
to substitute mechanical power
for human physical toil.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.216
Assembly lines were engineered

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.576
to replace inconsistent human handiwork

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.536
with machine perfection.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.776
Computers were programmed to swap out

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.456
error-prone, inconsistent
human calculation

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.240
with digital perfection.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.936
These inventions have worked.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.016
We no longer dig ditches by hand,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.096
pound tools out of wrought iron

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.400
or do bookkeeping using actual books.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.976
And yet, the fraction of US adults
employed in the labor market

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.856
is higher now in 2016

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.616
than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.656
and it's risen in just about every decade

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.000
in the intervening 125 years.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.240
This poses a paradox.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.816
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.976
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant
and our skills obsolete?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.696
Why are there still so many jobs?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.456
(Laughter)

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.816
I'm going to try to answer
that question tonight,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.576
and along the way, I'm going to tell you
what this means for the future of work

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.776
and the challenges that automation
does and does not pose

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.240
for our society.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280
Why are there so many jobs?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.056
There are actually two fundamental
economic principles at stake.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.776
One has to do with human genius

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.216
and creativity.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.096
The other has to do
with human insatiability,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.696
or greed, if you like.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.456
I'm going to call the first of these
the O-ring principle,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.656
and it determines
the type of work that we do.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.296
The second principle
is the never-get-enough principle,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.800
and it determines how many jobs
there actually are.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.776
Let's start with the O-ring.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.576
ATMs, automated teller machines,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.936
had two countervailing effects
on bank teller employment.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.656
As you would expect,
they replaced a lot of teller tasks.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.360
The number of tellers per branch
fell by about a third.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.056
But banks quickly discovered that it
also was cheaper to open new branches,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.216
and the number of bank branches
increased by about 40 percent

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.736
in the same time period.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840
The net result was more branches
and more tellers.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.856
But those tellers were doing
somewhat different work.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.536
As their routine,
cash-handling tasks receded,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.696
they became less like checkout clerks

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.536
and more like salespeople,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.616
forging relationships with customers,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.856
solving problems

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.096
and introducing them to new products
like credit cards, loans and investments:

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.960
more tellers doing
a more cognitively demanding job.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.480
There's a general principle here.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.816
Most of the work that we do

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.320
requires a multiplicity of skills,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.336
and brains and brawn,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.976
technical expertise and intuitive mastery,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.960
perspiration and inspiration
in the words of Thomas Edison.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.736
In general, automating
some subset of those tasks

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.976
doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.960
In fact, it makes them more important.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.056
It increases their economic value.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.096
Let me give you a stark example.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.936
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.256
exploded and crashed back down to Earth

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200
less than two minutes after takeoff.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.816
The cause of that crash, it turned out,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.376
was an inexpensive rubber O-ring
in the booster rocket

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.256
that had frozen on the launchpad
the night before

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.656
and failed catastrophically
moments after takeoff.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.495
In this multibillion dollar enterprise

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.216
that simple rubber O-ring

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.815
made the difference
between mission success

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.680
and the calamitous death
of seven astronauts.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.336
An ingenious metaphor
for this tragic setting

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.576
is the O-ring production function,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.096
named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.136
after the Challenger disaster.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.736
The O-ring production function
conceives of the work

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.096
as a series of interlocking steps,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.376
links in a chain.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.096
Every one of those links must hold
for the mission to succeed.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.256
If any of them fails,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.576
the mission, or the product
or the service,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.920
comes crashing down.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.496
This precarious situation
has a surprisingly positive implication,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.416
which is that improvements

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.416
in the reliability
of any one link in the chain

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.216
increases the value
of improving any of the other links.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.216
Concretely, if most of the links
are brittle and prone to breakage,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.696
the fact that your link
is not that reliable

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.976
is not that important.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Probably something else will break anyway.

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:22.016
But as all the other links
become robust and reliable,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.536
the importance of your link
becomes more essential.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.880
In the limit, everything depends upon it.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.176
The reason the O-ring was critical
to space shuttle Challenger

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.920
is because everything else
worked perfectly.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.056
If the Challenger were
kind of the space era equivalent

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.616
of Microsoft Windows 2000 --

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.736
(Laughter)

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.216
the reliability of the O-ring
wouldn't have mattered

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.098
because the machine would have crashed.

00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:48.602
(Laughter)

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.536
Here's the broader point.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.376
In much of the work that we do,
we are the O-rings.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.936
Yes, ATMs could do
certain cash-handling tasks

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.976
faster and better than tellers,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.056
but that didn't make tellers superfluous.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.376
It increased the importance
of their problem-solving skills

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.016
and their relationships with customers.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.336
The same principle applies
if we're building a building,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.896
if we're diagnosing
and caring for a patient,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.056
or if we are teaching a class

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.536
to a roomful of high schoolers.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.936
As our tools improve,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.056
technology magnifies our leverage

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.976
and increases the importance
of our expertise

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.200
and our judgment and our creativity.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.240
And that brings me
to the second principle:

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.360
never get enough.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.696
You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.816
that says the jobs that people do
will be important.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.816
They can't be done by machines,
but they still need to be done.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.736
But that doesn't tell me
how many jobs there will need to be.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.216
If you think about it,
isn't it kind of self-evident

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.776
that once we get sufficiently
productive at something,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.896
we've basically
worked our way out of a job?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.696
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.976
was on farms.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.256
Today, it's less than two percent.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.456
Why are there so few farmers today?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.336
It's not because we're eating less.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.016
(Laughter)

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.776
A century of productivity
growth in farming

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.976
means that now,
a couple of million farmers

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.736
can feed a nation of 320 million.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.416
That's amazing progress,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.576
but it also means there are
only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.616
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.376
Farming is only one example.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.040
There are many others like it.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.416
But what's true about a single product
or service or industry

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.216
has never been true
about the economy as a whole.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.736
Many of the industries
in which we now work --

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.896
health and medicine,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.136
finance and insurance,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.800
electronics and computing --

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.456
were tiny or barely existent
a century ago.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.296
Many of the products
that we spend a lot of our money on --

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.456
air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.176
computers and mobile devices --

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.856
were unattainably expensive,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.320
or just hadn't been invented
a century ago.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.896
As automation frees our time,
increases the scope of what is possible,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.136
we invent new products,
new ideas, new services

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.736
that command our attention,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.296
occupy our time

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.960
and spur consumption.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.976
You may think some
of these things are frivolous --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.776
extreme yoga, adventure tourism,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.056
Pokémon GO --

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.400
and I might agree with you.

00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:28.456
But people desire these things,
and they're willing to work hard for them.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.656
The average worker in 2015

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.936
wanting to attain
the average living standard in 1915

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.296
could do so by working
just 17 weeks a year,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.760
one third of the time.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.416
But most people don't choose to do that.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.135
They are willing to work hard

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.040
to harvest the technological bounty
that is available to them.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.576
Material abundance has never
eliminated perceived scarcity.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.176
In the words of economist
Thorstein Veblen,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.840
invention is the mother of necessity.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.720
Now ...

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.256
So if you accept these two principles,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.176
the O-ring principle
and the never-get-enough principle,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.536
then you agree with me.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960
There will be jobs.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.736
Does that mean there's
nothing to worry about?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.536
Automation, employment, robots and jobs --

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.480
it'll all take care of itself?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.336
No.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.416
That is not my argument.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.976
Automation creates wealth

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.576
by allowing us to do
more work in less time.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.176
There is no economic law

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.976
that says that we
will use that wealth well,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.800
and that is worth worrying about.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.616
Consider two countries,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.776
Norway and Saudi Arabia.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.376
Both oil-rich nations,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.976
it's like they have money
spurting out of a hole in the ground.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.536
(Laughter)

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.776
But they haven't used that wealth
equally well to foster human prosperity,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.000
human prospering.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.176
Norway is a thriving democracy.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.856
By and large, its citizens
work and play well together.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.896
It's typically numbered
between first and fourth

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.656
in rankings of national happiness.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.336
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.976
in which many citizens
lack a path for personal advancement.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.496
It's typically ranked 35th
among nations in happiness,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.616
which is low for such a wealthy nation.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.976
Just by way of comparison,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.800
the US is typically ranked
around 12th or 13th.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.496
The difference between these two countries

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.776
is not their wealth

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.536
and it's not their technology.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.880
It's their institutions.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.736
Norway has invested to build a society

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.096
with opportunity and economic mobility.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.296
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.576
while frustrating
many other human strivings.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.376
Two countries, both wealthy,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.120
not equally well off.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.216
And this brings me
to the challenge that we face today,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.376
the challenge that
automation poses for us.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.856
The challenge is not
that we're running out of work.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.816
The US has added 14 million jobs

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.976
since the depths of the Great Recession.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.536
The challenge is that many of those jobs

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.856
are not good jobs,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.976
and many citizens
cannot qualify for the good jobs

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.200
that are being created.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.336
Employment growth in the United States
and in much of the developed world

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.816
looks something like a barbell

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.216
with increasing poundage
on either end of the bar.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.456
On the one hand,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.296
you have high-education, high-wage jobs

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.896
like doctors and nurses,
programmers and engineers,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.656
marketing and sales managers.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.696
Employment is robust in these jobs,
employment growth.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.736
Similarly, employment growth
is robust in many low-skill,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.816
low-education jobs like food service,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.096
cleaning, security,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.360
home health aids.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.176
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.256
in many middle-education,
middle-wage, middle-class jobs,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.096
like blue-collar production
and operative positions

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.096
and white-collar
clerical and sales positions.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.376
The reasons behind this contracting middle

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.616
are not mysterious.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.616
Many of those middle-skill jobs

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.136
use well-understood rules and procedures

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.256
that can increasingly
be codified in software

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.640
and executed by computers.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.576
The challenge that
this phenomenon creates,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.136
what economists call
employment polarization,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.776
is that it knocks out rungs
in the economic ladder,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.616
shrinks the size of the middle class

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.776
and threatens to make us
a more stratified society.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.856
On the one hand, a set of highly paid,
highly educated professionals

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.296
doing interesting work,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.736
on the other, a large number
of citizens in low-paid jobs

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.416
whose primary responsibility is to see
to the comfort and health of the affluent.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.776
That is not my vision of progress,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.680
and I doubt that it is yours.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.456
But here is some encouraging news.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.336
We have faced equally momentous
economic transformations in the past,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.056
and we have come
through them successfully.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.016
In the late 1800s and early 1900s,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.576
when automation was eliminating
vast numbers of agricultural jobs --

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.936
remember that tractor? --

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.656
the farm states faced a threat
of mass unemployment,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.496
a generation of youth
no longer needed on the farm

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.280
but not prepared for industry.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.656
Rising to this challenge,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.176
they took the radical step

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.016
of requiring that
their entire youth population

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.896
remain in school
and continue their education

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.040
to the ripe old age of 16.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.576
This was called the high school movement,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.416
and it was a radically
expensive thing to do.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.696
Not only did they have
to invest in the schools,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.416
but those kids couldn't work
at their jobs.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.736
It also turned out to be
one of the best investments

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.976
the US made in the 20th century.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.336
It gave us the most skilled,
the most flexible

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.056
and the most productive
workforce in the world.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.616
To see how well this worked,
imagine taking the labor force of 1899

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.856
and bringing them into the present.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.816
Despite their strong backs
and good characters,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.616
many of them would lack
the basic literacy and numeracy skills

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.576
to do all but the most mundane jobs.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.840
Many of them would be unemployable.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.576
What this example highlights
is the primacy of our institutions,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.376
most especially our schools,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.936
in allowing us to reap the harvest

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.256
of our technological prosperity.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.696
It's foolish to say
there's nothing to worry about.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.920
Clearly we can get this wrong.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.136
If the US had not invested
in its schools and in its skills

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.416
a century ago with
the high school movement,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.096
we would be a less prosperous,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.736
a less mobile and probably
a lot less happy society.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.496
But it's equally foolish
to say that our fates are sealed.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.216
That's not decided by the machines.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.976
It's not even decided by the market.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.640
It's decided by us
and by our institutions.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.936
Now, I started this talk with a paradox.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.616
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.896
Why doesn't that make
our labor superfluous,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.136
our skills redundant?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.576
Isn't it obvious that the road
to our economic and social hell

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.800
is paved with our own great inventions?

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.216
History has repeatedly offered
an answer to that paradox.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.856
The first part of the answer
is that technology magnifies our leverage,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.496
increases the importance, the added value

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.056
of our expertise,
our judgment and our creativity.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.280
That's the O-ring.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.616
The second part of the answer
is our endless inventiveness

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.096
and bottomless desires

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.456
means that we never get enough,
never get enough.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.640
There's always new work to do.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.296
Adjusting to the rapid pace
of technological change

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.776
creates real challenges,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.776
seen most clearly
in our polarized labor market

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.320
and the threat that it poses
to economic mobility.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.760
Rising to this challenge is not automatic.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.896
It's not costless.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.336
It's not easy.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.560
But it is feasible.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.936
And here is some encouraging news.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.096
Because of our amazing productivity,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.376
we're rich.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.536
Of course we can afford
to invest in ourselves and in our children

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.896
as America did a hundred years ago
with the high school movement.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.200
Arguably, we can't afford not to.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.896
Now, you may be thinking,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.776
Professor Autor has told us
a heartwarming tale

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.576
about the distant past,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.976
the recent past,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.296
maybe the present,
but probably not the future.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.256
Because everybody knows
that this time is different.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.096
Right? Is this time different?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.016
Of course this time is different.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.736
Every time is different.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.376
On numerous occasions
in the last 200 years,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.176
scholars and activists
have raised the alarm

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.736
that we are running out of work
and making ourselves obsolete:

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.376
for example, the Luddites
in the early 1800s;

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.336
US Secretary of Labor James Davis

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.776
in the mid-1920s;

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.976
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Wassily Leontief in 1982;

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.256
and of course, many scholars,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.416
pundits, technologists

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.280
and media figures today.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.920
These predictions strike me as arrogant.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.496
These self-proclaimed oracles
are in effect saying,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.936
"If I can't think of what people
will do for work in the future,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.856
then you, me and our kids

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.595
aren't going to think of it either."

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.695
I don't have the guts

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.896
to take that bet against human ingenuity.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.896
Look, I can't tell you
what people are going to do for work

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.816
a hundred years from now.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.440
But the future doesn't hinge
on my imagination.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.056
If I were a farmer in Iowa
in the year 1900,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.616
and an economist from the 21st century
teleported down to my field

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.160
and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.536
in the next hundred years,

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.336
agricultural employment is going to fall
from 40 percent of all jobs

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.576
to two percent

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
purely due to rising productivity.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.560
What do you think the other
38 percent of workers are going to do?"

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.216
I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.096
We'll do app development,
radiological medicine,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.096
yoga instruction, Bitmoji."

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.656
(Laughter)

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.966
I wouldn't have had a clue.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.336
But I hope I would have had
the wisdom to say,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.376
"Wow, a 95 percent reduction
in farm employment

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.536
with no shortage of food.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.976
That's an amazing amount of progress.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.376
I hope that humanity
finds something remarkable to do

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.280
with all of that prosperity."

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.200
And by and large, I would say that it has.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.216
Thank you very much.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.295
(Applause)
