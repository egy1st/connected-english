00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.735
So when you look out
at the stars at night,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.216
it's amazing what you can see.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.696
It's beautiful.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.816
But what's more amazing
is what you can't see,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.216
because what we know now

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.616
is that around every star
or almost every star,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.896
there's a planet,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.120
or probably a few.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.216
So what this picture isn't showing you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.376
are all the planets that we know about

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800
out there in space.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.496
But when we think about planets,
we tend to think of faraway things

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.376
that are very different from our own.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.816
But here we are on a planet,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.136
and there are so many things
that are amazing about Earth

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.336
that we're searching far and wide
to find things that are like that.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.856
And when we're searching,
we're finding amazing things.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.096
But I want to tell you
about an amazing thing here on Earth.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.856
And that is that every minute,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.296
400 pounds of hydrogen

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.936
and almost seven pounds of helium

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.800
escape from Earth into space.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
And this is gas that is going off
and never coming back.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.456
So hydrogen, helium and many other things

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.336
make up what's known
as the Earth's atmosphere.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.176
The atmosphere is just these gases
that form a thin blue line

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.416
that's seen here from
the International Space Station,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.680
a photograph that some astronauts took.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.576
And this tenuous veneer around our planet

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.936
is what allows life to flourish.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.816
It protects our planet
from too many impacts,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.856
from meteorites and the like.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.656
And it's such an amazing phenomenon

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.496
that the fact that it's disappearing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.320
should frighten you,
at least a little bit.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.456
So this process is something that I study

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720
and it's called atmospheric escape.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.256
So atmospheric escape
is not specific to planet Earth.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.016
It's part of what it means
to be a planet, if you ask me,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.376
because planets, not just here on Earth
but throughout the universe,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.976
can undergo atmospheric escape.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.400
And the way it happens actually tells us
about planets themselves.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.576
Because when you think
about the solar system,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.640
you might think about this picture here.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.216
And you would say, well,
there are eight planets, maybe nine.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.736
So for those of you
who are stressed by this picture,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.136
I will add somebody for you.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.376
(Laughter)

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.280
Courtesy of New Horizons,
we're including Pluto.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.376
And the thing here is,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.136
for the purposes of this talk
and atmospheric escape,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.176
Pluto is a planet in my mind,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.136
in the same way that planets
around other stars that we can't see

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.936
are also planets.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.656
So fundamental characteristics of planets

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.696
include the fact that they are bodies

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.536
that are bound together by gravity.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.056
So it's a lot of material
just stuck together

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.680
with this attractive force.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.096
And these bodies are so big
and have so much gravity.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.416
That's why they're round.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.056
So when you look at all of these,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.296
including Pluto,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.520
they're round.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.736
So you can see that gravity
is really at play here.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.056
But another fundamental
characteristic about planets

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.816
is what you don't see here,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.416
and that's the star, the Sun,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.560
that all of the planets
in the solar system are orbiting around.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920
And that's fundamentally driving
atmospheric escape.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.096
The reason that fundamentally stars
drive atmospheric escape from planets

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.496
is because stars offer planets
particles and light and heat

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.616
that can cause the atmospheres to go away.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.456
So if you think of a hot-air balloon,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.616
or you look at this picture
of lanterns in Thailand at a festival,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.136
you can see that hot air
can propel gasses upward.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.416
And if you have enough energy and heating,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.776
which our Sun does,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.696
that gas, which is so light
and only bound by gravity,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.480
it can escape into space.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.536
And so this is what's actually
causing atmospheric escape

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.256
here on Earth and also on other planets --

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.976
that interplay
between heating from the star

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.320
and overcoming the force
of gravity on the planet.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.736
So I've told you that it happens

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.096
at the rate of 400 pounds
a minute for hydrogen

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.200
and almost seven pounds for helium.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.696
But what does that look like?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.536
Well, even in the '80s,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.296
we took pictures of the Earth

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.776
in the ultraviolet

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.696
using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.536
So these two images of the Earth

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.296
show you what that glow
of escaping hydrogen looks like,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.576
shown in red.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.216
And you can also see other features
like oxygen and nitrogen

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.696
in that white glimmer

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.056
in the circle showing you the auroras

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.976
and also some wisps around the tropics.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.016
So these are pictures
that conclusively show us

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.736
that our atmosphere isn't just
tightly bound to us here on Earth

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.376
but it's actually
reaching out far into space,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.320
and at an alarming rate, I might add.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.896
But the Earth is not alone
in undergoing atmospheric escape.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.376
Mars, our nearest neighbor,
is much smaller than Earth,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.176
so it has much less gravity
with which to hold on to its atmosphere.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.416
And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.656
we can see it's much thinner
than the Earth's.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.136
Just look at the surface.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.616
You see craters indicating
that it didn't have an atmosphere

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.496
that could stop those impacts.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.296
Also, we see that it's the "red planet,"

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.856
and atmospheric escape plays a role

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.456
in Mars being red.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.056
That's because we think
Mars used to have a wetter past,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.656
and when water had enough energy,
it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.416
and hydrogen being so light,
it escaped into space,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.376
and the oxygen that was left

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.216
oxidized or rusted the ground,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.960
making that familiar
rusty red color that we see.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.896
So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.376
and say that atmospheric escape
probably happened,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.496
but NASA has a probe that's currently
at Mars called the MAVEN satellite,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.056
and its actual job
is to study atmospheric escape.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.656
It's the Mars Atmosphere
and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.336
And results from it have already
shown pictures very similar

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.256
to what you've seen here on Earth.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.776
We've long known that Mars
was losing its atmosphere,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.576
but we have some stunning pictures.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.736
Here, for example,
you can see in the red circle

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.256
is the size of Mars,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.456
and in blue you can see the hydrogen
escaping away from the planet.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.016
So it's reaching out more than 10 times
the size of the planet,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.736
far enough away that it's
no longer bound to that planet.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.736
It's escaping off into space.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.976
And this helps us confirm ideas,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.760
like why Mars is red,
from that lost hydrogen.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.096
But hydrogen isn't
the only gas that's lost.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.296
I mentioned helium on Earth
and some oxygen and nitrogen,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.096
and from MAVEN we can also look
at the oxygen being lost from Mars.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.576
And you can see
that because oxygen is heavier,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.736
it can't get as far as the hydrogen,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.936
but it's still escaping
away from the planet.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.040
You don't see it all confined
into that red circle.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.816
So the fact that we not only see
atmospheric escape on our own planet

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.456
but we can study it elsewhere
and send spacecraft

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.576
allows us to learn
about the past of planets

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.856
but also about planets in general

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.656
and Earth's future.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.336
So one way we actually
can learn about the future

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.440
is by planets so far away
that we can't see.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.496
And I should just note though,
before I go on to that,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.976
I'm not going to show you
photos like this of Pluto,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.416
which might be disappointing,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.456
but that's because we don't have them yet.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.736
But the New Horizons mission
is currently studying atmospheric escape

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.096
being lost from the planet.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.840
So stay tuned and look out for that.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.696
But the planets
that I did want to talk about

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.016
are known as transiting exoplanets.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.816
So any planet orbiting a star
that's not our Sun

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.776
is called an exoplanet,
or extrasolar planet.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.256
And these planets that we call transiting

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.536
have the special feature

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.656
that if you look
at that star in the middle,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.056
you'll see that actually it's blinking.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.936
And the reason that it's blinking

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.976
is because there are planets
that are going past it all the time,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.136
and it's that special orientation

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.936
where the planets are blocking
the light from the star

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.240
that allows us to see that light blinking.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.816
And by surveying the stars
in the night sky

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.256
for this blinking motion,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.936
we are able to find planets.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.136
This is how we've now been able
to detect over 5,000 planets

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.376
in our own Milky Way,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.256
and we know there are
many more out there, like I mentioned.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.176
So when we look at the light
from these stars,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.696
what we see, like I said,
is not the planet itself,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.776
but you actually see
a dimming of the light

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.456
that we can record in time.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.895
So the light drops as the planet
decreases in front of the star,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.336
and that's that blinking
that you saw before.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.176
So not only do we detect the planets

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.015
but we can look at this light
in different wavelengths.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.135
So I mentioned looking at the Earth
and Mars in ultraviolet light.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.776
If we look at transiting exoplanets
with the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.896
we find that in the ultraviolet,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.576
you see much bigger blinking,
much less light from the star,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.376
when the planet is passing in front.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.816
And we think this is because you have
an extended atmosphere of hydrogen

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.056
all around the planet

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.576
that's making it look puffier

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.920
and thus blocking
more of the light that you see.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.776
So using this technique,
we've actually been able to discover

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.056
a few transiting exoplanets
that are undergoing atmospheric escape.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.896
And these planets
can be called hot Jupiters,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.536
for some of the ones we've found.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.136
And that's because
they're gas planets like Jupiter,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.936
but they're so close to their star,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.216
about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.696
And because there's all this
lightweight gas that's ready to escape,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.416
and all this heating from the star,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.256
you have completely catastrophic rates
of atmospheric escape.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.896
So unlike our 400 pounds per minute
of hydrogen being lost on Earth,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.176
for these planets,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.280
you're losing 1.3 billion
pounds of hydrogen every minute.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.656
So you might think, well,
does this make the planet cease to exist?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.696
And this is a question
that people wondered

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.536
when they looked at our solar system,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.896
because planets
closer to the Sun are rocky,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.856
and planets further away
are bigger and more gaseous.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.256
Could you have started
with something like Jupiter

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.976
that was actually close to the Sun,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.616
and get rid of all the gas in it?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.696
We now think that if you start
with something like a hot Jupiter,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.536
you actually can't end up
with Mercury or the Earth.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.736
But if you started with something smaller,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.536
it's possible that enough gas
would have gotten away

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.696
that it would have
significantly impacted it

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.056
and left you with something very different
than what you started with.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.976
So all of this sounds sort of general,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.536
and we might think about the solar system,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.336
but what does this have to do
with us here on Earth?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.136
Well, in the far future,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.296
the Sun is going to get brighter.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.536
And as that happens,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.880
the heating that we find from the Sun
is going to become very intense.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.936
In the same way that you see
gas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.296
gas is going to stream off from the Earth.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.496
And so what we can look forward to,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.576
or at least prepare for,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.416
is the fact that in the far future,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.216
the Earth is going to look more like Mars.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.976
Our hydrogen, from water
that is broken down,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.416
is going to escape
into space more rapidly,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.520
and we're going to be left
with this dry, reddish planet.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.456
So don't fear, it's not
for a few billion years,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.056
so there's some time to prepare.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.136
(Laughter)

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.976
But I wanted you
to be aware of what's going on,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.256
not just in the future,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.496
but atmospheric escape
is happening as we speak.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.016
So there's a lot of amazing science
that you hear about happening in space

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.976
and planets that are far away,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.216
and we are studying these planets
to learn about these worlds.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.936
But as we learn about Mars
or exoplanets like hot Jupiters,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.976
we find things like atmospheric escape

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.736
that tell us a lot more
about our planet here on Earth.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.816
So consider that the next time
you think that space is far away.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.056
Thank you.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.120
(Applause)
