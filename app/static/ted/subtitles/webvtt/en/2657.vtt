00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.098
Why do cats do that?

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:14.375
They're cute, they're lovable,

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:19.847
and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:21.068
of them pouncing,

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:21.975
bouncing,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:22.841
climbing,

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:23.639
cramming,

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:24.540
stalking,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.290
clawing,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.031
chattering,

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:27.083
and purring,

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.921
one thing is certain:

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.041
cats are very entertaining.

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.328
These somewhat strange feline behaviors,

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.392
both amusing and baffling,

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:40.576
leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?"

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:45.983
Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.198
and prey for larger carnivores.

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:50.784
As both predator and prey,

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:55.609
survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.635
which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today.

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.973
While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing,

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.060
in the wild, these same behaviors,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.188
naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years,

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:13.377
would make Grizmo a super cat.

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:18.108
Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities,

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:22.263
cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:24.831
and spot prey in the wild.

00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:29.155
Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.887
in her food bowl today,

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:34.357
but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase

00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:37.911
is exactly what she has evolved to do.

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:44.122
As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:45.980
Since most cat prey are small,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.651
cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:54.991
and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.862
This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys

00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:02.860
and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.141
Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments,

00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:12.541
so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings

00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.436
is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:24.361
that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before.

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:30.181
In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense.

00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:34.778
Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready,

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:36.901
helped stretch their back and leg muscles,

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.321
and relieve some stress, too.

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:41.451
So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch,

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.287
chair,

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.272
ottoman,

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.017
pillows,

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:44.794
curtains,

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:47.499
and everything else 
you put in her environment.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.134
She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape

00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:57.763
because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive.

00:02:57.763 --> 00:02:59.506
As animals that were preyed upon,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:01.883
cats evolved to not get caught,

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:06.195
and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:07.651
So at your house today,

00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:11.449
Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.663
and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots.

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:19.727
It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:23.388
That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators

00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:26.573
that may be sniffing around nearby.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.859
Considering everything 
we do know about cats,

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.789
it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.292
is still one of the most mysterious.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:37.623
Cats may purr for any number of reasons,

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:38.809
such as happiness,

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:39.838
stress,

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:41.131
and hunger.

00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:43.726
But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs,

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.466
between 25 and 150 hertz,

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:51.292
is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration.

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.777
So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion,

00:03:54.777 --> 00:04:00.118
it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones,

00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:03.265
and maybe even yours, too.

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:04.627
They developed through time

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:07.752
as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat,

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:12.063
and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive.

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:15.245
So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:19.686
that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years.

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:23.512
This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors.

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:26.093
To them, our homes are their jungles.

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:28.961
But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes,

00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:30.442
who are we?

00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:34.007
Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources?

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:38.545
Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart every day?

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.989
Or maybe they think we're the prey.
