WEBVTT

00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:03.811
We're going to share
a lot of secrets today, you and I,

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.291
and in doing so, I hope that we can lift

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.915
some of the shame
many of us feel about sex.

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:14.395
How many here have ever been
catcalled by a stranger?

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:17.635
Lots of women.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:21.178
For me, the time I remember best

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:24.562
is when that stranger
was a student of mine.

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.531
He came up to me after class that night

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.411
and his words confirmed
what I already knew:

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.211
"I am so sorry, professor.

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:37.131
If I had known it was you,
I would never have said those things."

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:39.451
(Laughter)

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.555
I wasn't a person to him
until I was his professor.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:47.091
This concept, called objectification,

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.171
is the foundation of sexism,

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.715
and we see it reinforced
through every aspect of our lives.

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.851
We see it in the government

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:01.291
that refuses to punish men

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:03.051
for raping women.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:05.371
We see it in advertisements.

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.403
How many of you have seen an advertisement

00:01:07.427 --> 00:01:12.795
that uses a woman's breast
to sell an entirely unrelated product?

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:18.291
Or movie after movie after movie

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.195
that portrays women
as only love interests?

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:25.811
These examples might seem
inconsequential and harmless,

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.091
but they're insidious,

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.395
slowly building into a culture
that refuses to see women as people.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:36.145
We see this in the school
that sends home a 10-year-old girl

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:39.811
because her clothes were
a distraction to boys trying to learn,

00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:45.011
or the government that refuses
to punish men for raping women

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.611
over and over,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.091
or the woman who is killed

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:52.195
because she asked a man to stop
grinding on her on the dance floor.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.275
Media plays a large role in perpetuating
the objectification of women.

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.211
Let's consider
the classic romantic comedy.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:08.131
We're typically introduced
to two kinds of women in these movies,

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:10.891
two kinds of desirable women, anyway.

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:13.331
The first is the sexy bombshell.

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:17.011
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman
with the perfect body.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.651
Our leading man
has no trouble identifying her

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.035
and even less trouble having sex with her.

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:24.611
The second is our leading lady,

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:28.491
the beautiful but demure woman
our leading man falls in love with

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.651
despite not noticing her at first

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:33.275
or not liking her if he did.

00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:35.851
The first is the slut.

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.891
She is to be consumed and forgotten.

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:39.195
She is much too available.

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:43.451
The second is desirable but modest,

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.931
and therefore worthy
of our leading man's future babies.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:48.155
Marriage material.

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:51.691
We're actually told
that women have two roles,

00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:55.955
but these two roles have a difficult time
existing within the same woman.

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.211
On the rare occasion
that I share with a new acquaintance

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:01.971
that I study sex,

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.371
if they don't end
the conversation right then,

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.395
they're usually pretty intrigued.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.091
"Oh. Tell me more."

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:10.315
So I do.

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.811
"I'm really interested
in studying the sexual behaviors

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.611
of pregnant and postpartum couples."

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:20.171
At this point I get
a different kind of response.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.171
(Laughter)

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:23.995
"Oh. Huh.

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:26.875
Do pregnant people even have sex?

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:32.011
Have you thought
about studying sexual desire

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:33.371
or orgasms?

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:36.395
That would be interesting, and sexy."

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:40.651
Tell me. What are the first words
that come to mind

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.475
when you picture a pregnant woman?

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:46.691
I asked this question
in a survey of over 500 adults,

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:50.291
and most responded with "belly" or "round"

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:52.355
and "cute."

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:54.651
This didn't surprise me too much.

00:03:54.675 --> 00:03:56.315
What else do we label as cute?

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.331
Babies. Puppies. Kittens.

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:02.011
The elderly. Right?

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.755
(Laughter)

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.707
When we label an adult as cute, though,

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.211
we take away a lot of their intelligence,

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:11.435
their complexity.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:14.675
We reduce them to childlike qualities.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.211
I also asked heterosexual men

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:20.371
to imagine a woman that they're
partnered with is pregnant,

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:23.171
and then asked women
to imagine that they are pregnant,

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.811
and then tell me
the first words that come to mind

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:27.875
when they imagine having sex.

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:31.035
Most of the responses were negative.

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:33.669
"Gross."

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:35.066
"Awkward."

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.531
"Not sexy." "Odd."

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:38.755
"Uncomfortable."

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:40.491
"How?"

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.515
(Laughter)

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.411
"Not worth the trouble."
"Not worth the risk."

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.435
That last one really stuck with me.

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:54.451
We might think that because we divorce
pregnant women and moms from sexuality,

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:59.491
we are removing the constraints
of sexual objectification.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.555
They experience less sexism. Right?

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.811
Not exactly.

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:06.955
What happens instead
is a different kind of objectification.

00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:10.011
In my efforts to explain this to others,

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:13.811
one conversation
led to the Venus of Willendorf,

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:18.651
a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed
was a goddess of love and beauty,

00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:20.115
hence the name Venus.

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.651
This theory was later revised, though,

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:26.371
when scholars noted
the sculptor's obvious focus

00:05:26.395 --> 00:05:29.811
on the figurine's reproductive features:

00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:33.091
large breasts,
considered ideal for nursing;

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:35.731
a round, possibly pregnant belly;

00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:39.235
the remnants of red dye,
alluding to menstruation or birth.

00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:44.090
They also assumed that she was
meant to be held or placed lying down

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.491
because her tiny feet
don't allow her to be freestanding.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.995
She also had no face.

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:54.891
For this reason, it was assumed
that she was a representation of fertility

00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:57.771
and not a portrait of a person.

00:05:57.795 --> 00:05:59.075
She was an object.

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:01.491
In the history of her interpretation,

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:04.651
she went from object
of ideal beauty and love

00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:06.515
to object of reproduction.

00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:09.811
I think this transition speaks more

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:13.611
about the scholars
who have interpreted her purpose

00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:17.635
than the actual purpose
of the figurine herself.

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:20.451
When a woman becomes pregnant,

00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:24.211
she leaves the realm
of men's sexual desire

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:28.811
and slides into her reproductive
and child-rearing role.

00:06:28.835 --> 00:06:31.451
In doing so, she also becomes

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.251
the property of the community,

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:37.755
considered very important
but only because she's pregnant. Right?

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.811
I've taken to calling this
the Willendorf effect,

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:44.515
and once again we see it reinforced
in many aspects of her life.

00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:47.731
Has anyone here
ever been visibly pregnant?

00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:48.971
(Laughter)

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.251
Yeah. Lots of you, right?

00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:54.411
So how many of you ever had a stranger
touch your belly during pregnancy,

00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:57.771
maybe without even asking
your permission first?

00:06:57.795 --> 00:07:00.531
Or told what you can and cannot eat

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:04.171
by somebody who is not your doctor,
your medical care provider?

00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:07.115
Or asked private questions
about your birth plan?

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:10.875
And then told why
those choices are all wrong?

00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:12.771
Yeah, me too.

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:17.051
Or had a server refuse
to bring you a glass of wine?

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:19.811
This one might give you pause,
I know, but stay with me.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.931
This is a huge secret.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:25.875
It is actually safe to drink
in moderation during pregnancy.

00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:28.051
Many of us don't know this

00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:31.811
because doctors don't trust
pregnant women with this secret --

00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.595
(Laughter)

00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:41.611
especially if she's less educated
or a woman of color.

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:43.371
What this tells us is,

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:47.611
this Willendorf effect,
it's also classist and racist.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:53.531
It's present when
the government reminds women

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:56.211
with every new anti-choice bill

00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:59.091
that the contents of her uterus
are not her own,

00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:01.171
or when an ob-gyn says,

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.491
"While it's safe
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:04.851
sometimes you never know.

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:06.515
Better safe than sorry, right?"

00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:11.651
She's denied basic privacy
and bodily autonomy

00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:13.675
under the guise of "be a good mother."

00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:16.595
We don't trust her
to make her own decisions.

00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:18.715
She's cute, remember?

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:24.091
When we tell women

00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:27.051
that sexual pleasure -- excuse me.

00:08:27.075 --> 00:08:31.891
When we tell women that sex
isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,

00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:36.171
what we're telling her is that
her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:39.491
So what we are telling her
is that she in fact doesn't matter,

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:44.235
even though the needs of her fetus
are not at odds with her own needs.

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:47.451
So medical providers,

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:50.451
such as the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

00:08:50.475 --> 00:08:55.371
have the opportunity to educate
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:56.795
So what do the experts say?

00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:00.251
ACOG actually has
no public official statement

00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:03.435
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:07.091
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic
is generally positive

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:09.611
but presented with a caveat:

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.786
"Although most women can safely
have sex throughout pregnancy,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.931
sometimes it's best to be cautious."

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:18.051
Some women don't want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:19.331
and that's OK.

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:21.971
Some women do want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.411
and that's OK, too.

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:26.091
What needs to stop
is society telling women

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.435
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.595
(Applause)

00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:40.691
Pregnant women are not faceless,
identity-less vessels of reproduction

00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:42.835
who can't stand on their own two feet.

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:46.531
But the truth is, the real secret is,

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:50.811
we tell all women that
their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:54.051
We refuse to even acknowledge
that women who have sex with women

00:09:54.075 --> 00:09:56.395
or women who don't
want children even exist.

00:09:56.835 --> 00:09:58.531
"Oh, it's just a phase ...

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:00.875
she just needs the right man
to come along."

00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.491
Every time a woman has sex

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:06.491
simply because it feels good,

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:08.251
it is revolutionary.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:10.451
She is revolutionary.

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:13.051
She is pushing back
against society's insistence

00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:15.291
that she exist simply for men's pleasure

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:16.635
or for reproduction.

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:22.411
A woman who prioritizes
her sexual needs is scary,

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:27.571
because a woman who prioritizes
her sexual needs prioritizes herself.

00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:31.371
(Applause)

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:35.811
That is a woman demanding
that she be treated as an equal.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.371
That is a woman who insists

00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:40.731
that you make room for her
at the table of power,

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:42.651
and that is the most terrifying of all

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.491
because we can't make room for her

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:49.035
without some of us giving up
the extra space we hold.

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.035
(Applause)

00:10:56.475 --> 00:10:58.115
I have one last secret for you.

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:00.811
I am the mother of two boys

00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:02.835
and we could use your help.

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:08.011
Even though my boys hear me say regularly

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.571
that it's important for men
to recognize women as equals

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:14.131
and they see their father modeling this,

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:18.275
we need what happens in the world
to reinforce what happens in our home.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.891
This is not a men's problem
or a women's problem.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:23.491
This is everyone's problem,

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:27.915
and we all play a role
in dismantling systems of inequality.

00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:31.131
For starters, we have got
to stop telling women

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:33.571
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

00:11:33.595 --> 00:11:36.635
(Applause)

00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:42.131
This includes not treating pregnant women
like community property.

00:11:42.155 --> 00:11:45.851
If you don't know her,
don't even ask to touch her belly.

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:47.571
You wouldn't anybody else.

00:11:47.595 --> 00:11:49.731
Don't tell her
what she can and cannot eat.

00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:52.771
Don't ask her private details
about her medical decisions.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.691
This also includes understanding

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:57.291
that even if you are
personally against abortion,

00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:59.995
you can still fight
for a woman's right to choose.

00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:04.275
When it comes to women's equality,
the two need not oppose one another.

00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.251
If you're somebody who has sex with women,

00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:08.771
prioritize her pleasure.

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:11.195
If you don't know how, ask.

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:13.571
If you have children --

00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:15.531
(Laughter)

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:19.331
have conversations about sex
as early as possible,

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:23.731
because kids don't look up s-e-x
in the dictionary anymore.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.395
They look it up on the internet.

00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:29.035
And when you're having
those conversations about sex,

00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:31.731
don't center them on reproduction only.

00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:33.411
People have sex for many reasons,

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:35.211
some because they want a baby,

00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:38.171
but most of us have sex
because it feels good.

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:39.395
Admit it.

00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:43.371
And regardless of whether
you have children or not,

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:47.651
support comprehensive sex education
that doesn't shame our teenagers.

00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:50.355
(Applause)

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.731
Nothing positive comes from shaming teens

00:12:58.755 --> 00:13:01.355
for their sexual desires, behaviors,

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:05.635
other than positive STD
and pregnancy tests.

00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:09.691
Every single day,
we are all given the opportunity

00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:12.435
to disrupt patterns of inequality.

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:16.475
I think we can all agree
that it's worth the trouble to do so.

00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:18.451
Thank you.

00:13:18.475 --> 00:13:25.431
(Applause)
