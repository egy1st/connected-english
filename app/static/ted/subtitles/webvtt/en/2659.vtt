00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.312
I am a chef

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:03.677
and a food policy guy,

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.072
but I come from a whole
family of teachers.

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:11.391
My sister is a special ed
teacher in Chicago.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:15.662
My father just retired
after 25 years teaching fifth grade.

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.322
My aunt and uncle were professors.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:19.998
My cousins all teach.

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:23.604
Everybody in my family, basically,
teaches except for me.

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:29.622
They taught me that the only way
to get the right answers

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.191
is to ask the right questions.

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:34.634
So what are the right questions

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:38.817
when it comes to improving
the educational outcomes for our children?

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.628
There's obviously
many important questions,

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.124
but I think the following
is a good place to start:

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.090
What do we think the connection is

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:52.533
between a child's growing mind

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:53.949
and their growing body?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.608
What can we expect our kids to learn

00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:01.641
if their diets are full of sugar
and empty of nutrients?

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:04.798
What can they possibly learn

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:09.284
if their bodies
are literally going hungry?

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:13.964
And with all the resources
that we are pouring into schools,

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:16.140
we should stop and ask ourselves:

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:19.110
Are we really setting
our kids up for success?

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.824
Now, a few years ago,

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:26.002
I was a judge on a cooking
competition called "Chopped."

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:29.578
Four chefs compete
with mystery ingredients

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:32.246
to see who can cook the best dishes.

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.648
Except for this episode --
it was a very special one.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:40.834
Instead of four overzealous chefs
trying to break into the limelight --

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:42.925
something that I would know
nothing about --

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:43.990
(Laughter)

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.673
these chefs were school chefs;

00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:49.846
you know, the women that you used
to call "lunch ladies,"

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.834
but the ones I insist
we call "school chefs."

00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:56.283
Now, these women -- God bless
these women --

00:01:56.307 --> 00:02:00.240
spend their day cooking
for thousands of kids,

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:04.032
breakfast and lunch,
with only $2.68 per lunch,

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.194
with only about a dollar of that
actually going to the food.

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:10.083
In this episode,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.733
the main-course
mystery ingredient was quinoa.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.061
Now, I know it's been a long time

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.281
since most of you have had a school lunch,

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:19.917
and we've made a lot
of progress on nutrition,

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:23.075
but quinoa still is not a staple
in most school cafeterias.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.942
(Laughter)

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.332
So this was a challenge.

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:30.174
But the dish that I will never forget
was cooked by a woman

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:31.855
named Cheryl Barbara.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.613
Cheryl was the nutrition director

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:36.001
at High School in the Community
in Connecticut.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:38.182
She cooked this delicious pasta.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:39.432
It was amazing.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:42.099
It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:43.895
kale, Parmesan cheese.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.178
It was delicious, like,
restaurant-quality good, except --

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:50.962
she basically just threw the quinoa,
pretty much uncooked,

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.164
into the dish.

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:54.273
It was a strange choice,

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:56.770
and it was super crunchy.

00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.436
(Laughter)

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.378
So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
that you're supposed to do,

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:06.240
and I asked her why she did that.

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.113
Cheryl responded, "Well, first,
I don't know what quinoa is."

00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:11.197
(Laughter)

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.237
"But I do know that it's a Monday,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.618
and that in my school,
at High School in the Community,

00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:20.534
I always cook pasta."

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:23.758
See, Cheryl explained
that for many of her kids,

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:26.812
there were no meals on the weekends.

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:30.438
No meals on Saturday.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:33.993
No meals on Sunday, either.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:38.513
So she cooked pasta
because she wanted to make sure

00:03:38.537 --> 00:03:43.275
she cooked something she knew
her children would eat.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.454
Something that would stick
to their ribs, she said.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:51.138
Something that would fill them up.

00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:56.797
Cheryl talked about how,
by the time Monday came,

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:00.568
her kids' hunger pangs were so intense

00:04:00.592 --> 00:04:03.345
that they couldn't even begin
to think about learning.

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:07.977
Food was the only thing on their mind.

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:11.884
The only thing.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.463
And unfortunately, the stats --
they tell the same story.

00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:18.752
So, let's put this
into the context of a child.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:21.939
And we're going to focus on

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.207
the most important meal
of the day, breakfast.

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.542
Meet Allison.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.070
She's 12 years old,

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.750
she's smart as a whip

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:31.537
and she wants to be a physicist
when she grows up.

00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:35.570
If Allison goes to a school
that serves a nutritious breakfast

00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:36.840
to all of their kids,

00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:38.414
here's what's going to follow.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:42.211
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:45.401
one with fruit and milk,
one lower in sugar and salt,

00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:47.011
dramatically increase.

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:51.320
Allison will have a lower rate
of obesity than the average kid.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:53.129
She'll have to visit the nurse less.

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:56.172
She'll have lower levels
of anxiety and depression.

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.712
She'll have better behavior.

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.991
She'll have better attendance,
and she'll show up on time more often.

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:02.387
Why?

00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:05.411
Well, because there's a good meal
waiting for her at school.

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:08.834
Overall, Allison is in much better health

00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.942
than the average school kid.

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.520
So what about that kid

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:16.531
who doesn't have a nutritious
breakfast waiting for him?

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:17.963
Well, meet Tommy.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.974
He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.

00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:22.478
He wants to be a doctor.

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:24.549
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,

00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:27.402
he's already underperforming in math.

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:30.354
By the time he's in third grade,

00:05:30.378 --> 00:05:32.975
he's got lower math and reading scores.

00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:35.951
By the time he's 11,

00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:39.806
it's more likely that Tommy will have
to have repeated a grade.

00:05:41.092 --> 00:05:44.189
Research shows that kids
who do not have consistent nourishment,

00:05:44.213 --> 00:05:45.468
particularly at breakfast,

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:48.773
have poor cognitive function overall.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.884
So how widespread is this problem?

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:55.871
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.

00:05:57.228 --> 00:05:58.453
Let me give you two stats

00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:01.441
that seem like they're on opposite
ends of the issue,

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:03.613
but are actually two sides
of the same coin.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.154
On the one hand,

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:09.386
one in six Americans are food insecure,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.651
including 16 million children --
almost 20 percent --

00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:14.784
are food insecure.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.895
In this city alone, in New York City,

00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:23.477
474,000 kids under the age of 18
face hunger every year.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.059
It's crazy.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.630
On the other hand,

00:06:28.503 --> 00:06:32.612
diet and nutrition is the number one cause
of preventable death and disease

00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:34.339
in this country, by far.

00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.492
And fully a third of the kids
that we've been talking about tonight

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.290
are on track to have diabetes
in their lifetime.

00:06:42.807 --> 00:06:45.189
Now, what's hard
to put together but is true

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:47.756
is that, many times,
these are the same children.

00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:51.754
So they fill up on the unhealthy
and cheap calories

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.968
that surround them in their communities
and that their families can afford.

00:06:56.752 --> 00:06:58.709
But then by the end of the month,

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.322
food stamps run out
or hours get cut at work,

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:06.423
and they don't have the money
to cover the basic cost of food.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.415
But we should be able
to solve this problem, right?

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.107
We know what the answers are.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:18.048
As part of my work at the White House,
we instituted a program

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:21.566
that for all schools that had
40 percent more low-income kids,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.514
we could serve breakfast and lunch
to every kid in that school.

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:27.431
For free.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:30.356
This program has been
incredibly successful,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.432
because it helped us overcome
a very difficult barrier

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:37.601
when it came to getting kids
a nutritious breakfast.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.342
And that was the barrier of stigma.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.026
See, schools serve
breakfast before school,

00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:51.826
and it was only available
for the poor kids.

00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:56.700
So everybody knew who was poor
and who needed government help.

00:07:57.597 --> 00:08:02.397
Now, all kids, no matter how much
or how little their parents make,

00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:03.781
have a lot of pride.

00:08:05.107 --> 00:08:06.384
So what happened?

00:08:06.977 --> 00:08:09.445
Well, the schools that have
implemented this program

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:14.168
saw an increase in math and reading
scores by 17.5 percent.

00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:16.572
17.5 percent.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.929
And research shows that when kids
have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:27.544
their chances of graduating
increase by 20 percent.

00:08:28.313 --> 00:08:29.904
20 percent.

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:34.771
When we give our kids
the nourishment they need,

00:08:34.795 --> 00:08:36.881
we give them the chance to thrive,

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:40.036
both in the classroom and beyond.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.866
Now, you don't have to trust me on this,

00:08:44.644 --> 00:08:46.599
but you should talk to Donna Martin.

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:48.996
I love Donna Martin.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.697
Donna Martin is the school nutrition
director at Burke County

00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:54.403
in Waynesboro, Georgia.

00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:57.766
Burke County is one
of the poorest districts

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.493
in the fifth-poorest state in the country,

00:09:00.517 --> 00:09:06.646
and about 100 percent of Donna's students
live at or below the poverty line.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.883
A few years ago,

00:09:08.907 --> 00:09:12.861
Donna decided to get out ahead
of the new standards that were coming,

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:15.171
and overhaul her nutrition standards.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.851
She improved and added
fruit and vegetables and whole grains.

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:23.820
She served breakfast in the classroom
to all of her kids.

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:26.198
And she implemented a dinner program.

00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:27.379
Why?

00:09:28.336 --> 00:09:31.430
Well, many of her kids didn't have
dinner when they went home.

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:34.184
So how did they respond?

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:36.829
Well, the kids loved the food.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.265
They loved the better nutrition,

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:41.262
and they loved not being hungry.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:46.416
But Donna's biggest supporter
came from an unexpected place.

00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:49.139
His name from Eric Parker,

00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:52.797
and he was the head football coach
for the Burke County Bears.

00:09:53.668 --> 00:09:56.733
Now, Coach Parker had coached
mediocre teams for years.

00:09:56.757 --> 00:09:59.680
The Bears often ended
in the middle of the pack --

00:09:59.704 --> 00:10:02.866
a big disappointment in one
of the most passionate football states

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.058
in the Union.

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:09.150
But the year Donna changed the menus,

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:12.681
the Bears not only won their division,

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:15.144
they went on to win
the state championship,

00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:17.534
beating the Peach County Trojans

00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:18.880
28-14.

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:21.259
(Laughter)

00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:22.797
And Coach Parker,

00:10:23.507 --> 00:10:26.788
he credited that championship
to Donna Martin.

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:32.035
When we give our kids
the basic nourishment,

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:33.464
they're going to thrive.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.350
And it's not just
up to the Cheryl Barbaras

00:10:37.374 --> 00:10:39.229
and the Donna Martins of the world.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.395
It's on all of us.

00:10:42.218 --> 00:10:46.704
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition
is just the starting point.

00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:49.482
What I've laid out is really a model

00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:52.581
for so many of the most pressing
issues that we face.

00:10:54.183 --> 00:10:59.403
If we focus on the simple goal
of properly nourishing ourselves,

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:03.675
we could see a world
that is more stable and secure;

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:08.097
we could dramatically improve
our economic productivity;

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:11.574
we could transform our health care

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:14.412
and we could go a long way

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:17.482
in ensuring that the Earth can provide
for generations to come.

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:22.174
Food is that place
where our collective efforts

00:11:22.198 --> 00:11:24.071
can have the greatest impact.

00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:28.910
So we have to ask ourselves:
What is the right question?

00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:30.462
What would happen

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:36.011
if we fed ourselves more nutritious,
more sustainably grown food?

00:11:36.702 --> 00:11:38.066
What would be the impact?

00:11:39.184 --> 00:11:40.599
Cheryl Barbara,

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:43.531
Donna Martin,

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:45.714
Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.183
I think they know the answer.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.818
Thank you guys so very much.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:54.314
(Applause)
