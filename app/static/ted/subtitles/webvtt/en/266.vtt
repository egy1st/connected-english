00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I remember these Turkish carpets,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
from this soldier.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And then there was another influence.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I fused together the two things I loved the most,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which was skiing and windsurfing.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, I created this compilation of the two:

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and some foot straps, and some metal fins,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I realized then I had to go to design school.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I mean, look at those graphics there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, I went to design school,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it was the early '90s when I finished.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so I wanted to be there,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and we would get in to these meetings,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and these managers would come in,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and they would say,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And they would give the projects code names, you know,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and I would ask questions.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
"You know, do people really use it?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I didn't want to be a colorist.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It wasn't what I wanted to do.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And then I saw this quote:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and I started a little company, fuseproject.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so the first projects were sort of humble,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but they took technology and maybe made it into things

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that people would use in a new way,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and maybe finding some new functionality.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
right when it launched,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and it's the first watch that has a display

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that switches from horizontal to vertical.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
without bending my elbow.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And other projects, which were really about transformation,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
about matching the human need.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and it ships completely flat,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And something a little bit more experimental:

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
this is a light fixture for Swarovski,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and what it does is, it changes shape.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is a pretty involved process;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
it took us about four and a half years.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
a new experience of light.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And the new experience I was looking for

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is giving the choice for the user to go from

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
all the way to a bright work light.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, the light bulb actually does that.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It allows the person to switch,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and to mix these two colorations.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And it's done in a very simple way:

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
one just touches the base of the light,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and on one side, you can mix the brightness,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and on the other, the coloration of the light.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and I think as designers we need to really think

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
about how we can create a different relationship

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
between our work and the world,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
whether it's for business,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
value to business, value to the users also,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but I think it's the values that we put into these projects

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that ultimately create the greater value.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And the values we bring

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
can be about environmental issues,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
about sustainability, about lower power consumption.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You know, they can be about function and beauty;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
they can be about business strategy.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But designers are really the glue

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that brings these things together.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it has a humanistic technology.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and it knows when it is you're talking.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And by knowing when it is you're talking,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
which is the environmental noises.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and all the nerdy stuff out of it,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and try to make it as beautiful as we can.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I mean, think about it:

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or accessories is really important,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And this is what we're pursuing here.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I want to point at something here, on the left.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that makes this technology work.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But this is the design process:

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
there's somebody changing the board,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
as the designers on the other side are doing the work.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's really about designing from the inside out.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And then, on the other side of the room,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the designers are making small adjustments,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And it's what I call being design driven.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You know, there is some push and pull,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
but design is really helping define

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the whole experience from the inside out.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And then, of course, design is never done.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And this is -- the other new way that is unique

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
in how we work is, because it's never done,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
you have to do all this other stuff.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to really touch the user, in many ways.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
you know, really understands that you need a different structure.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
it's a partnership. We can continue to work

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and dedicate ourselves to this project,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and then we also share in the rewards.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
This is called Y Water,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Austrian originally, who came to us,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
or an organic drink for his kids,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to replace the high-sugar-content sodas

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that he's trying to get them away from.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, we worked on this bottle,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The bottles connect together,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and you can create different shapes, different forms.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Laughter)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
(Applause)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Thank you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Applause)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then while we were doing this,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
are probably the most important words that kids ask.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So we called it Y Water. And so this is

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
another place where it all comes together in the same room:

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
it all becomes deeply connected.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And then the other thing about this project is,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
we bring intellectual property,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
we bring a marketing approach,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
what we bring is these values,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it's especially rewarding when your design work

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
becomes a creative endeavor,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when others can be creative and do more with it.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Here's another project,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
which I think really emulates that.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This picture is incredible.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I mean, to me, it just means so much.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But when Nicholas Negroponte --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and he has spoken about this project a lot,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
about two and a half years ago,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
there were some clear ideas.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and those are pillars of his life,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
But what he said was really significant,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is that design was going to be why the kids

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
were going to love this product,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
how we were going to make it low cost, robust.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
(Laughter) --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and the Num Lock key, too.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And then the integration of

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
all these great technologies, which you've heard about,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the screen, which you can read in sunlight;

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and it's protected from the environment.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You know, all these great technologies really happened

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
because of the passion and

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
the OLPC people and the engineers.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They fought the suppliers,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they fought the manufacturers.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I mean, they fought like animals

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
for this to remain they way it is.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
allows the process

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
from not destroying the original idea.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And I think this is something really important.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So, now you get these pictures --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and you see them in Uruguay

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with their computers, and in Mongolia.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And we went away from obviously the beige.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It's because we were able

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
to run, during the manufacturing process,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
20 colors for the X and the O,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
which is the name of the computer,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
you get 20 times 20: you get

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
400 different options there.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, the lessons from seeing the kids

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
using them in the developing world are incredible.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and he had the laptop for an afternoon,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and I had to take it back. It was hard.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
(Laughter)

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I come back to Switzerland,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and there he is playing with his own version.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Laughter)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Like paper, paper and cardboard.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So, I'm going to finish with one last project,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and this is a little bit more of adult play.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
(Laughter)

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
February 14, about 10 days ago.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and they needed a way to distribute

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and it has to be easily serviceable:

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you have to know where it is and what it does.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And we also designed the condoms themselves.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And I was just in New York at the launch,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and I went to see all these places where they're installed:

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Of course, clubs and discos, too.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And here's the public service announcement for this project.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:47.000
(Music)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
(Laughter)

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Get some.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
(Applause)

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So, this is really where design

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is able to create a conversation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I was in these venues, and people were,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
you know, really into getting them. They were excited.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
It was breaking the ice,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
it was getting over a stigma,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and I think that's also what design can do.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So, I was going to

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
(Laughter)

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
(Laughter)

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
(Applause)

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
(Laughter)

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
you can just say you like the design.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
(Laughter)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So, I'll finish with just one thought:

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
if we all work together on creating value,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I think we can change the work that we do.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
So, thank you.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
(Applause)
