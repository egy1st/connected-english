00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:04.853
OK, so today I want to talk
about how we talk about love.

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:06.387
And specifically,

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:09.846
I want to talk about what's wrong
with how we talk about love.

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:14.080
Most of us will probably
fall in love a few times

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:15.569
over the course of our lives,

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:19.803
and in the English language,
this metaphor, falling,

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:22.841
is really the main way that we
talk about that experience.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:24.743
I don't know about you,

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.694
but when I conceptualize this metaphor,

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.596
what I picture is straight
out of a cartoon --

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:31.372
like there's a man,

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.113
he's walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:36.249
without realizing it, he crosses
over an open manhole,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:39.934
and he just plummets into the sewer below.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.038
And I picture it this way
because falling is not jumping.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.801
Falling is accidental,

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.727
it's uncontrollable.

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.276
It's something that happens to us
without our consent.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.493
And this --

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:57.084
this is the main way we talk
about starting a new relationship.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:02.103
I am a writer and I'm also
an English teacher,

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:04.412
which means I think
about words for a living.

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:08.586
You could say that I get paid
to argue that the language we use matters,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.810
and I would like to argue
that many of the metaphors we use

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.401
to talk about love --

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:16.248
maybe even most of them --

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:17.673
are a problem.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.593
So, in love, we fall.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.231
We're struck.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:24.651
We are crushed.

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:26.701
We swoon.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.983
We burn with passion.

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.715
Love makes us crazy,

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.303
and it makes us sick.

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:35.156
Our hearts ache,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.186
and then they break.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:41.370
So our metaphors equate
the experience of loving someone

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.047
to extreme violence or illness.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.156
(Laughter)

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.252
They do.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:50.259
And they position us as the victims

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:53.642
of unforeseen and totally
unavoidable circumstances.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:57.270
My favorite one of these is "smitten,"

00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.148
which is the past participle
of the word "smite."

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:03.240
And if you look this word up
in the dictionary --

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:04.288
(Laughter)

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:08.830
you will see that it can be defined
as both "grievous affliction,"

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:11.705
and, "to be very much in love."

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.060
I tend to associate the word "smite"
with a very particular context,

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:18.648
which is the Old Testament.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.308
In the Book of Exodus alone,
there are 16 references to smiting,

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:28.105
which is the word that the Bible uses
for the vengeance of an angry God.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.850
(Laughter)

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.579
Here we are using the same word
to talk about love

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:35.029
that we use to explain
a plague of locusts.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:36.081
(Laughter)

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.361
Right?

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.477
So, how did this happen?

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.492
How have we come to associate love
with great pain and suffering?

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:47.505
And why do we talk about
this ostensibly good experience

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.633
as if we are victims?

00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:52.247
These are difficult questions,

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:53.917
but I have some theories.

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.180
And to think this through,

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.832
I want to focus on one
metaphor in particular,

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:00.027
which is the idea of love as madness.

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:03.795
When I first started
researching romantic love,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.580
I found these madness
metaphors everywhere.

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.707
The history of Western culture

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.668
is full of language that equates
love to mental illness.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.367
These are just a few examples.

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:16.734
William Shakespeare:

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:18.191
"Love is merely a madness,"

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.532
from "As You Like It."

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.349
Friedrich Nietzsche:

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.876
"There is always some madness in love."

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.425
"Got me looking, got me looking
so crazy in love -- "

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.518
(Laughter)

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.140
from the great philosopher,
BeyoncÃ© Knowles.

00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:33.625
(Laughter)

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.917
I fell in love for the first
time when I was 20,

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:41.120
and it was a pretty turbulent
relationship right from the start.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.664
And it was long distance
for the first couple of years,

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:49.284
so for me that meant very high highs
and very low lows.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.998
I can remember one moment in particular.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.925
I was sitting on a bed
in a hostel in South America,

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.645
and I was watching the person
I love walk out the door.

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:01.764
And it was late,

00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:03.048
it was nearly midnight,

00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:05.049
we'd gotten into an argument over dinner,

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:07.022
and when we got back to our room,

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:09.771
he threw his things in the bag
and stormed out.

00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.400
While I can no longer remember
what that argument was about,

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.479
I very clearly remember
how I felt watching him leave.

00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:22.667
I was 22, it was my first time
in the developing world,

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:25.679
and I was totally alone.

00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:29.779
I had another week until my flight home,

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.171
and I knew the name
of the town that I was in,

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:35.778
and the name of the city
that I needed to get to to fly out,

00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:39.058
but I had no idea how to get around.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:43.019
I had no guidebook and very little money,

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:44.813
and I spoke no Spanish.

00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:47.644
Someone more adventurous than me

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:50.098
might have seen this as
a moment of opportunity,

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.952
but I just froze.

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:54.223
I just sat there.

00:04:54.738 --> 00:04:56.781
And then I burst into tears.

00:04:57.357 --> 00:04:59.728
But despite my panic,

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:02.322
some small voice in my head thought,

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.683
"Wow. That was dramatic.

00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:07.406
I must really be doing
this love thing right."

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.218
(Laughter)

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:13.762
Because some part of me
wanted to feel miserable in love.

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:17.666
And it sounds so strange
to me now, but at 22,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.835
I longed to have dramatic experiences,

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:26.057
and in that moment, I was irrational
and furious and devastated,

00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.305
and weirdly enough,

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:30.705
I thought that this somehow
legitimized the feelings I had

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.568
for the guy who had just left me.

00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:38.526
I think on some level I wanted
to feel a little bit crazy,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.082
because I thought that
that was how love worked.

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:44.948
This really should not be surprising,

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.426
considering that according to Wikipedia,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.723
there are eight films,

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:51.744
14 songs,

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.965
two albums and one novel
with the title "Crazy Love."

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.963
About half an hour later,
he came back to our room.

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:00.138
We made up.

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:02.979
We spent another mostly
happy week traveling together.

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:04.435
And then, when I got home,

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:09.443
I thought, "That was so
terrible and so great.

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.704
This must be a real romance."

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.706
I expected my first love
to feel like madness,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.510
and of course, it met
that expectation very well.

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.632
But loving someone like that --

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:25.751
as if my entire well-being depended
on him loving me back --

00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:27.868
was not very good for me

00:06:27.892 --> 00:06:29.042
or for him.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.551
But I suspect this experience of love
is not that unusual.

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:38.237
Most of us do feel a bit mad
in the early stages of romantic love.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:42.631
In fact, there is research to confirm
that this is somewhat normal,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.166
because, neurochemically speaking,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.752
romantic love and mental illness
are not that easily distinguished.

00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:52.197
This is true.

00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:56.780
This study from 1999 used blood tests

00:06:56.804 --> 00:06:59.898
to confirm that the serotonin
levels of the newly in love

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:02.719
very closely resembled
the serotonin levels

00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:06.048
of people who had been diagnosed
with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:07.080
(Laughter)

00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:09.801
Yes, and low levels of serotonin

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:13.427
are also associated
with seasonal affective disorder

00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:14.731
and depression.

00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:17.947
So there is some evidence

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:22.319
that love is associated with changes
to our moods and our behaviors.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:26.350
And there are other studies to confirm

00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:30.064
that most relationships begin this way.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.823
Researchers believe
that the low levels of serotonin

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:38.882
is correlated with obsessive thinking
about the object of love,

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:42.964
which is like this feeling that someone
has set up camp in your brain.

00:07:42.988 --> 00:07:45.919
And most of us feel this way
when we first fall in love.

00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:49.069
But the good news is,
it doesn't always last that long --

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:52.266
usually from a few months
to a couple of years.

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:56.160
When I got back from my trip
to South America,

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.761
I spent a lot of time alone in my room,

00:07:59.785 --> 00:08:01.125
checking my email,

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.512
desperate to hear from the guy I loved.

00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:09.893
I decided that if my friends could not
understand my grievous affliction,

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:11.866
then I did not need their friendship.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.973
So I stopped hanging out
with most of them.

00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:18.581
And it was probably the most
unhappy year of my life.

00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:23.200
But I think I felt like
it was my job to be miserable,

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:25.641
because if I could be miserable,

00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:28.332
then I would prove how much I loved him.

00:08:28.356 --> 00:08:30.241
And if I could prove it,

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:33.219
then we would have to end up
together eventually.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.138
This is the real madness,

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:38.557
because there is no cosmic rule

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:41.943
that says that great suffering
equals great reward,

00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:46.382
but we talk about love as if this is true.

00:08:47.463 --> 00:08:51.139
Our experiences of love
are both biological and cultural.

00:08:51.774 --> 00:08:54.233
Our biology tells us that love is good

00:08:54.257 --> 00:08:57.411
by activating these reward
circuits in our brain,

00:08:57.435 --> 00:09:02.055
and it tells us that love is painful
when, after a fight or a breakup,

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.689
that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:07.597
And in fact -- and maybe
you've heard this --

00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.465
neurochemically speaking,

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:12.923
going through a breakup is a lot
like going through cocaine withdrawal,

00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:15.311
which I find reassuring.

00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:16.485
(Laughter)

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:19.898
And then our culture uses language

00:09:19.922 --> 00:09:22.703
to shape and reinforce
these ideas about love.

00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:25.351
In this case, we're talking
about metaphors about pain

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.890
and addiction and madness.

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.270
It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.

00:09:30.294 --> 00:09:33.811
Love is powerful and at times painful,

00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:36.600
and we express this
in our words and stories,

00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:39.680
but then our words and stories prime us

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.166
to expect love to be powerful and painful.

00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:47.128
What's interesting to me
is that all of this happens

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:49.875
in a culture that values
lifelong monogamy.

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.719
It seems like we want it both ways:

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:55.094
we want love to feel like madness,

00:09:55.718 --> 00:09:58.864
and we want it to last an entire lifetime.

00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:01.124
That sounds terrible.

00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:02.677
(Laughter)

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.449
To reconcile this,

00:10:05.473 --> 00:10:10.498
we need to either change our culture
or change our expectations.

00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:15.001
So, imagine if we were all
less passive in love.

00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:19.788
If we were more assertive,
more open-minded, more generous

00:10:19.812 --> 00:10:23.113
and instead of falling in love,

00:10:23.137 --> 00:10:25.362
we stepped into love.

00:10:26.223 --> 00:10:28.152
I know that this is asking a lot,

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:31.650
but I'm not actually
the first person to suggest this.

00:10:33.012 --> 00:10:35.521
In their book, "Metaphors We Live By,"

00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:40.659
linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff
suggest a really interesting solution

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:41.901
to this dilemma,

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.907
which is to change our metaphors.

00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:50.212
They argue that metaphors really do shape
the way we experience the world,

00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:54.569
and that they can even act
as a guide for future actions,

00:10:54.593 --> 00:10:56.481
like self-fulfilling prophecies.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:11:01.045
Johnson and Lakoff suggest
a new metaphor for love:

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:04.091
love as a collaborative work of art.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:07.922
I really like this way
of thinking about love.

00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:12.550
Linguists talk about metaphors
as having entailments,

00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:16.370
which is essentially a way of considering
all the implications of,

00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:19.326
or ideas contained
within, a given metaphor.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.259
And Johnson and Lakoff
talk about everything

00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:24.435
that collaborating
on a work of art entails:

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:29.131
effort, compromise,
patience, shared goals.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.485
These ideas align nicely
with our cultural investment

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:35.582
in long-term romantic commitment,

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:39.217
but they also work well
for other kinds of relationships --

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.676
short-term, casual, polyamorous,
non-monogamous, asexual --

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.585
because this metaphor brings
much more complex ideas

00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:51.649
to the experience of loving someone.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.064
So if love is a collaborative work of art,

00:11:57.088 --> 00:12:00.500
then love is an aesthetic experience.

00:12:01.524 --> 00:12:03.419
Love is unpredictable,

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:06.177
love is creative,

00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:11.031
love requires communication
and discipline,

00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:14.244
it is frustrating
and emotionally demanding.

00:12:14.677 --> 00:12:18.027
And love involves both joy and pain.

00:12:18.742 --> 00:12:22.361
Ultimately, each experience
of love is different.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.386
When I was younger,

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.078
it never occurred to me that I was allowed
to demand more from love,

00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:33.795
that I didn't have to just accept
whatever love offered.

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:38.104
When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --

00:12:38.128 --> 00:12:42.053
or, when 14-year-old Juliet
cannot be with Romeo,

00:12:42.077 --> 00:12:44.714
whom she has met four days ago,

00:12:44.738 --> 00:12:48.548
she does not feel disappointed or angsty.

00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:50.379
Where is she?

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:51.697
She wants to die.

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:53.387
Right?

00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:55.880
And just as a refresher,
at this point in the play,

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.212
act three of five,

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:59.057
Romeo is not dead.

00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:00.981
He's alive,

00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:02.393
he's healthy,

00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:04.611
he's just been banished from the city.

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:11.854
I understand that 16th-century Verona
is unlike contemporary North America,

00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:14.856
and yet when I first read this play,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.273
also at age 14,

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.980
Juliet's suffering made sense to me.

00:13:21.295 --> 00:13:26.652
Reframing love as something
I get to create with someone I admire,

00:13:26.676 --> 00:13:29.120
rather than something
that just happens to me

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:31.666
without my control or consent,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.295
is empowering.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.397
It's still hard.

00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:40.953
Love still feels totally maddening
and crushing some days,

00:13:40.977 --> 00:13:43.092
and when I feel really frustrated,

00:13:43.116 --> 00:13:44.446
I have to remind myself:

00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:48.339
my job in this relationship
is to talk to my partner

00:13:48.363 --> 00:13:50.414
about what I want to make together.

00:13:51.923 --> 00:13:54.257
This isn't easy, either.

00:13:54.756 --> 00:13:58.203
But it's just so much better
than the alternative,

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:01.449
which is that thing
that feels like madness.

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:08.196
This version of love is not about winning
or losing someone's affection.

00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:12.359
Instead, it requires
that you trust your partner

00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:15.457
and talk about things
when trusting feels difficult,

00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:17.927
which sounds so simple,

00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:22.447
but is actually a kind
of revolutionary, radical act.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:26.326
This is because you get to stop
thinking about yourself

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.371
and what you're gaining
or losing in your relationship,

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:33.792
and you get to start thinking
about what you have to offer.

00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.216
This version of love
allows us to say things like,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.070
"Hey, we're not very good collaborators.
Maybe this isn't for us."

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:47.594
Or, "That relationship
was shorter than I had planned,

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:49.790
but it was still kind of beautiful."

00:14:50.836 --> 00:14:53.626
The beautiful thing
about the collaborative work of art

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.541
is that it will not paint
or draw or sculpt itself.

00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:01.009
This version of love allows us
to decide what it looks like.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.184
Thank you.

00:15:02.208 --> 00:15:04.231
(Applause)
