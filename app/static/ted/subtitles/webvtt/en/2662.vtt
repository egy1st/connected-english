00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.520
When I was a child,
I knew I had superpowers.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.135
That's right.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.256
(Laughter)

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.296
I thought I was absolutely amazing
because I could understand

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.456
and relate to the feelings
of brown people,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.880
like my grandfather,
a conservative Muslim guy.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.256
And also, I could understand
my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.080
not so religious
but laid-back, fairly liberal.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.096
And of course, I could understand

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.536
and relate to the feelings
of white people.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.400
The white Norwegians of my country.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.056
You know, white, brown, whatever --

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.896
I loved them all.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.176
I understood them all,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.536
even if they didn't always
understand each other;

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.800
they were all my people.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.536
My father, though,
was always really worried.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.896
He kept saying that
even with the best education,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.096
I was not going to get a fair shake.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.536
I would still face discrimination,
according to him.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.376
And that the only way
to be accepted by white people

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.576
would be to become famous.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Now, mind you, he had this conversation
with me when I was seven years old.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.416
So while I'm seven years old, he said,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.816
"Look, so it's either got to be sports,
or it's got to be music."

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.296
He didn't know anything about sports --
bless him -- so it was music.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.656
So when I was seven years old,
he gathered all my toys, all my dolls,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.280
and he threw them all away.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.016
In exchange he gave me
a crappy little Casio keyboard and --

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.256
(Laughter)

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.296
Yeah. And singing lessons.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.096
And he forced me, basically, to practice
for hours and hours every single day.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.376
Very quickly, he also had me performing
for larger and larger audiences,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.176
and bizarrely, I became
almost a kind of poster child

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.280
for Norwegian multiculturalism.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.496
I felt very proud, of course.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.856
Because even the newspapers at this point

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.456
were starting to write
nice things about brown people,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.640
so I could feel
that my superpower was growing.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.936
So when I was 12 years old,
walking home from school,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.176
I took a little detour

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.735
because I wanted to buy
my favorite sweets called "salty feet."

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520
I know they sound kind of awful,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.136
but I absolutely love them.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
They're basically these little
salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.360
And now that I say it out loud,
I realize how terrible that sounds,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.776
but be that as it may,
I absolutely love them.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.896
So on my way into the store,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.456
there was this grown white guy
in the doorway blocking my way.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.416
So I tried to walk around him,
and as I did that, he stopped me

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240
and he was staring at me,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.136
and he spit in my face, and he said,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.376
"Get out of my way

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.656
you little black bitch,
you little Paki bitch,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.600
go back home where you came from."

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.696
I was absolutely horrified.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.016
I was staring at him.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.960
I was too afraid
to wipe the spit off my face,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.976
even as it was mixing with my tears.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.696
I remember looking around,
hoping that any minute now,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.376
a grown-up is going to come
and make this guy stop.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.720
But instead, people kept hurrying past me
and pretended not to see me.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
I was very confused
because I was thinking, well,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.936
"My white people, come on!
Where are they? What's going on?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.080
How come they're not
coming and rescuing me?"

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.016
So, needless to say,
I didn't buy the sweets.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160
I just ran home as fast as I could.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.120
Things were still OK, though, I thought.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.896
As time went on,
the more successful I became,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.040
I eventually started also
attracting harassment from brown people.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.816
Some men in my parent's community
felt that it was unacceptable

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.696
and dishonorable for a woman
to be involved in music

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.680
and to be so present in the media.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.696
So very quickly, I was starting
to become attacked at my own concerts.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.736
I remember one of the concerts,
I was onstage, I lean into the audience

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.016
and the last thing I see
is a young brown face,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.256
and the next thing I know is some sort
of chemical is thrown in my eyes

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.496
and I remember I couldn't really see
and my eyes were watering

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.120
but I kept singing anyway.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.560
I was spit in the face in the streets
of Oslo, this time by brown men.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.576
They even tried to kidnap me at one point.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.656
The death threats were endless.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.936
I remember one older bearded guy
stopped me in the street one time,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.096
and he said, "The reason
I hate you so much

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.176
is because you make our daughters think

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.760
they can do whatever they want."

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.376
A younger guy warned me to watch my back.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.416
He said music is un-Islamic
and the job of whores,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.176
and if you keep this up,
you are going to be raped

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.880
and your stomach will be cut out so that
another whore like you will not be born.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.256
Again, I was so confused.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.185
I couldn't understand what was going on.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.889
My brown people now starting
to treat me like this -- how come?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.656
Instead of bridging the worlds,
the two worlds,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.680
I felt like I was falling
between my two worlds.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.600
I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.576
So by the time I was 17 years old,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.616
the death threats were endless,
and the harassment was constant.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.402
It got so bad, at one point
my mother sat me down and said,

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:23.896
"Look, we can no longer protect you,
we can no longer keep you safe,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.696
so you're going to have to go."

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.120
So I bought a one-way ticket to London,
I packed my suitcase and I left.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.856
My biggest heartbreak at that point
was that nobody said anything.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.240
I had a very public exit from Norway.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.656
My brown people, my white people --
nobody said anything.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.800
Nobody said, "Hold on, this is wrong.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.656
Support this girl, protect this girl,
because she is one of us."

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.296
Nobody said that.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.360
Instead, I felt like --
you know at the airport,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.976
on the baggage carousel
you have these different suitcases

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.256
going around and around,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.776
and there's always
that one suitcase left at the end,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.816
the one that nobody wants,
the one that nobody comes to claim.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.120
I felt like that.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.440
I'd never felt so alone.
I'd never felt so lost.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.360
So, after coming to London,
I did eventually resume my music career.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.200
Different place, but unfortunately
the same old story.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.376
I remember a message sent to me
saying that I was going to be killed

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.776
and that rivers of blood
were going to flow

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.256
and that I was going to be raped
many times before I died.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.696
By this point, I have to say,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.176
I was actually getting used
to messages like this,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.480
but what became different was that
now they started threatening my family.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.000
So once again, I packed my suitcase,
I left music and I moved to the US.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.776
I'd had enough.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.416
I didn't want to have anything
to do with this anymore.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.096
And I was certainly not
going to be killed for something

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.800
that wasn't even my dream --
it was my father's choice.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.376
So I kind of got lost.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.936
I kind of fell apart.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.296
But I decided that what I wanted to do

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.656
is spend the next
however many years of my life

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.336
supporting young people

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.256
and to try to be there in some small way,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.976
whatever way that I could.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.256
I started volunteering
for various organizations

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.920
that were working
with young Muslims inside of Europe.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.096
And, to my surprise, what I found was

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.600
so many of these young people
were suffering and struggling.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.976
They were facing so many problems
with their families and their communities

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.616
who seemed to care more
about their honor and their reputation

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.400
than the happiness
and the lives of their own kids.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.760
I started feeling like maybe I wasn't
so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.600
Maybe there are more
of my people out there.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.496
The thing is, what most people
don't understand

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.816
is that there are so many of us
growing up in Europe

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.256
who are not free to be ourselves.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.360
We're not allowed to be who we are.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.416
We are not free to marry

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.376
or to be in relationships
with people that we choose.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.056
We can't even pick our own career.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.856
This is the norm in the Muslim
heartlands of Europe.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.960
Even in the freest societies
in the world, we're not free.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.536
Our lives, our dreams, our future
does not belong to us,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.816
it belongs to our parents
and their community.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.920
I found endless stories of young people

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.775
who are lost to all of us,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.535
who are invisible to all of us

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.360
but who are suffering,
and they are suffering alone.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.840
Kids we are losing to forced marriages,
to honor-based violence and abuse.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.976
Eventually, I realized after several
years of working with these young people,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.016
that I will not be able to keep running.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.696
I can't spend the rest of my life
being scared and hiding

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.160
and that I'm actually
going to have to do something.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.736
And I also realized
that my silence, our silence,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.080
allows abuse like this to continue.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.496
So I decided that I wanted to put
my childhood superpower to some use

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.216
by trying to make people on the different
sides of these issues understand

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.360
what it's like to be a young person stuck
between your family and your country.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.480
So I started making films,
and I started telling these stories.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.296
And I also wanted people to understand
the deadly consequences of us

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.400
not taking these problems seriously.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.360
So the first film I made was about Banaz.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.680
She was a 17-year-old
Kurdish girl in London.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.320
She was obedient, she did
whatever her parents wanted.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.256
She tried to do everything right.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.896
She married some guy
that her parents chose for her,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.880
even though he beat
and raped her constantly.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.696
And when she tried to go
to her family for help, they said,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.976
"Well, you got to go back
and be a better wife."

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.816
Because they didn't want
a divorced daughter on their hands

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.800
because, of course, that would
bring dishonor on the family.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.280
She was beaten so badly
her ears would bleed,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.296
and when she finally left
and she found a young man that she chose

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.136
and she fell in love with,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.416
the community and the family found out

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.840
and she disappeared.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.280
She was found three months later.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.320
She'd been stuffed into a suitcase
and buried underneath the house.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.560
She had been strangled,
she had been beaten to death

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.280
by three men, three cousins,
on the orders of her father and uncle.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.136
The added tragedy of Banaz's story

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.056
is that she had gone to the police
in England five times asking for help,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.136
telling them that she was
going to be killed by her family.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.040
The police didn't believe her
so they didn't do anything.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.336
And the problem with this

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.736
is that not only are so many of our kids
facing these problems

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.856
within their families
and within their families' communities,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.520
but they're also meeting misunderstandings

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.160
and apathy in the countries
that they grow up in.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.336
When their own families betray them,
they look to the rest of us,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.416
and when we don't understand,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.640
we lose them.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.296
So while I was making this film,
several people said to me,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.856
"Well, Deeyah, you know,
this is just their culture,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.071
this is just what those people
do to their kids

00:11:29.095 --> 00:11:30.655
and we can't really interfere."

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.080
I can assure you
being murdered is not my culture.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.496
You know?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.216
And surely people who look like me,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.736
young women who come
from backgrounds like me,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.856
should be subject to the same rights,
the same protections

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.880
as anybody else in our country, why not?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.096
So, for my next film,
I wanted to try and understand

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.976
why some of our young
Muslim kids in Europe

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.080
are drawn to extremism and violence.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.136
But with that topic,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.320
I also recognized that I was going
to have to face my worst fear:

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.640
the brown men with beards.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.696
The same men, or similar men,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.520
to the ones that have hounded me
for most of my life.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.256
Men that I've been afraid of
most of my life.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.136
Men that I've also deeply disliked,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.600
for many, many years.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.136
So I spent the next two years
interviewing convicted terrorists,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.656
jihadis and former extremists.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.016
What I already knew,
what was very obvious already,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.216
was that religion, politics,
Europe's colonial baggage,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.496
also Western foreign policy
failures of recent years,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.000
were all a part of the picture.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.776
But what I was more interested
in finding out was what are the human,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.376
what are the personal reasons

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.720
why some of our young people
are susceptible to groups like this.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.360
And what really surprised me
was that I found wounded human beings.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.216
Instead of the monsters
that I was looking for,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.616
that I was hoping to find --

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.776
quite frankly because
it would have been very satisfying --

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.400
I found broken people.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.016
Just like Banaz,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.296
I found that these young men
were torn apart

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.856
from trying to bridge the gaps

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.360
between their families
and the countries that they were born in.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.096
And what I also learned
is that extremist groups, terrorist groups

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.576
are taking advantage
of these feelings of our young people

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.456
and channeling that -- cynically --
channeling that toward violence.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.056
"Come to us," they say.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.056
"Reject both sides,
your family and your country

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.736
because they reject you.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.856
For your family, their honor
is more important than you

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.136
and for your country,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.040
a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person
will always be white and never you."

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.496
They're also promising our young people
the things that they crave:

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.856
significance, heroism,
a sense of belonging and purpose,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.280
a community that loves and accepts them.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.136
They make the powerless feel powerful.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.040
The invisible and the silent
are finally seen and heard.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.656
This is what they're doing
for our young people.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.520
Why are these groups doing this
for our young people and not us?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.336
The thing is,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.696
I'm not trying to justify

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.456
or excuse any of the violence.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.056
What I am trying to say
is that we have to understand

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.240
why some of our young people
are attracted to this.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.016
I would like to also show you, actually --

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.320
these are childhood photos
of some of the guys in the film.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.200
What really struck me
is that so many of them --

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.616
I never would have thought this --

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.960
but so many of them
have absent or abusive fathers.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.736
And several of these young guys

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.896
ended up finding caring
and compassionate father figures

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.520
within these extremist groups.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.080
I also found men
brutalized by racist violence,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.056
but who found a way
to stop feeling like victims

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.576
by becoming violent themselves.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.896
In fact, I found something,
to my horror, that I recognized.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:25.240
I found the same feelings that I felt
as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.536
The same confusion, the same sorrow,

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.040
the same feeling of being betrayed

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.360
and not belonging to anyone.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.680
The same feeling of being lost
and torn between cultures.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.296
Having said that,
I did not choose destruction,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.056
I chose to pick up a camera
instead of a gun.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.416
And the reason I did that
is because of my superpower.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.336
I could see that understanding
is the answer, instead of violence.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.056
Seeing human beings

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.816
with all their virtues and all their flaws

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.696
instead of continuing the caricatures:

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.376
the us and them, the villains and victims.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.496
I'd also finally
come to terms with the fact

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.176
that my two cultures
didn't have to be on a collision course

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.320
but instead became a space
where I found my own voice.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.576
I stopped feeling
like I had to pick a side,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.680
but this took me many, many years.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.656
There are so many
of our young people today

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.696
who are struggling with these same issues,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.720
and they're struggling with this alone.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.080
And this leaves them open like wounds.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.616
And for some, the worldview
of radical Islam

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.000
becomes the infection
that festers in these open wounds.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160
There's an African proverb that says,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.976
"If the young are not
initiated into the village,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.760
they will burn it down
just to feel its warmth."

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.720
I would like to ask --

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.176
to Muslim parents and Muslim communities,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.616
will you love and care for your children

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.416
without forcing them
to meet your expectations?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.880
Can you choose them instead of your honor?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.415
Can you understand
why they're so angry and alienated

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.760
when you put your honor
before their happiness?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.096
Can you try to be a friend to your child

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.896
so that they can trust you

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.215
and want to share with you
their experiences,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.480
rather than having
to seek it somewhere else?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.440
And to our young people
tempted by extremism,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.320
can you acknowledge
that your rage is fueled by pain?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.056
Will you find the strength
to resist those cynical old men

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.280
who want to use your blood
for their own profits?

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.960
Can you find a way to live?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.136
Can you see that the sweetest revenge

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.616
is for you to live
a happy, full and free life?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.000
A life defined by you and nobody else.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.240
Why do you want to become
just another dead Muslim kid?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.240
And for the rest of us, when will we start
listening to our young people?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.776
How can we support them

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.760
in redirecting their pain
into something more constructive?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.216
They think we don't like them.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.016
They think we don't care
what happens to them.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.816
They think we don't accept them.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.560
Can we find a way
to make them feel differently?

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.216
What will it take for us
to see them and notice them

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.176
before they become either the victims
or the perpetrators of violence?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.776
Can we make ourselves care about them
and consider them to be our own?

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.656
And not just be outraged when the victims
of violence look like ourselves?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.696
Can we find a way to reject hatred
and heal the divisions between us?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.696
The thing is we cannot afford
to give up on each other or on our kids,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.856
even if they've given up on us.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.056
We are all in this together.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.560
And in the long term, revenge and violence
will not work against extremists.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.256
Terrorists want us
to huddle in our houses in fear,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.456
closing our doors and our hearts.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.296
They want us to tear open
more wounds in our societies

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.856
so that they can use them
to spread their infection more widely.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.576
They want us to become like them:

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.840
intolerant, hateful and cruel.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.656
The day after the Paris attacks,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.080
a friend of mine
sent this photo of her daughter.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.256
This is a white girl and an Arab girl.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.480
They're best friends.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.600
This image is the kryptonite
for extremists.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.296
These two little girls
with their superpowers

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.816
are showing the way forward

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.240
towards a society
that we need to build together,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.440
a society that includes and supports,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.680
rather than rejects our kids.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.296
Thank you for listening.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:55.532
(Applause)
