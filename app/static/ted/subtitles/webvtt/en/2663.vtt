WEBVTT

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.016
For the past few years,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.369
I've been spending my summers
in the marine biological laboratory

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:08.383
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.093
And there, what I've been doing
is essentially renting a boat.

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:15.717
What I would like to do is ask you

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:17.971
to come on a boat ride with me tonight.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.729
So, we ride off from Eel Pond
into Vineyard Sound,

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.264
right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.625
equipped with a drone
to identify potential spots

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.126
from which to peer into the Atlantic.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.429
Earlier, I was going to say
into the depths of the Atlantic,

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.632
but we don't have to go too deep
to reach the unknown.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.882
Here, barely two miles away

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:47.452
from what is arguably the greatest
marine biology lab in the world,

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:50.697
we lower a simple
plankton net into the water

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.542
and bring up to the surface

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.966
things that humanity rarely
pays any attention to,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.522
and oftentimes has never seen before.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.204
Here's one of the organisms
that we caught in our net.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.487
This is a jellyfish.

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:05.193
But look closely,

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:08.208
and living inside of this animal
is another organism

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:10.937
that is very likely
entirely new to science.

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:12.639
A complete new species.

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:15.820
Or how about this other transparent beauty

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:17.384
with a beating heart,

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:20.836
asexually growing on top of its head,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.046
progeny that will move on
to reproduce sexually.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:26.034
Let me say that again:

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:29.744
this animal is growing asexually
on top of its head,

00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:34.255
progeny that is going to reproduce
sexually in the next generation.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.278
A weird jellyfish?

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.106
Not quite.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.412
This is an ascidian.

00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:41.056
This is a group of animals

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.827
that now we know we share
extensive genomic ancestry with,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:49.574
and it is perhaps the closest
invertebrate species to our own.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.745
Meet your cousin,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:53.199
Thalia democratica.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:55.181
(Laughter)

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:59.195
I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot
at your last family reunion

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.651
for Thalia,

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:02.327
but let me tell you,

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.679
these animals are profoundly related to us

00:02:05.703 --> 00:02:08.735
in ways that we're just
beginning to understand.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:14.289
So, next time you hear anybody
derisively telling you

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:18.210
that this type of research
is a simple fishing expedition,

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:21.234
I hope that you'll remember
the trip that we just took.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.515
Today, many of the biological
sciences only see value

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.088
in studying deeper what we already know --

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:30.622
in mapping already-discovered continents.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.437
But some of us are much more
interested in the unknown.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.793
We want to discover
completely new continents,

00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:42.218
and gaze at magnificent
vistas of ignorance.

00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:46.770
We crave the experience
of being completely baffled

00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:48.968
by something we've never seen before.

00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:50.262
And yes, I agree

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:54.086
there's a lot of little ego satisfaction
in being able to say,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.585
"Hey, I was the first one
to discover that."

00:02:57.102 --> 00:03:00.007
But this is not
a self-aggrandizing enterprise,

00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:02.731
because in this type
of discovery research,

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:06.373
if you don't feel like a complete
idiot most of the time,

00:03:06.397 --> 00:03:08.678
you're just not sciencing hard enough.

00:03:08.702 --> 00:03:10.736
(Laughter)

00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:17.997
So every summer I bring onto the deck
of this little boat of ours

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:21.438
more and more things
that we know very little about.

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:26.304
I would like tonight
to tell you a story about life

00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:29.668
that rarely gets told
in an environment like this.

00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:36.250
From the vantage point of our 21st-century
biological laboratories,

00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:40.191
we have begun to illuminate
many mysteries of life with knowledge.

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.506
We sense that after centuries
of scientific research,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.637
we're beginning to make
significant inroads

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.527
into understanding some of the most
fundamental principles of life.

00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:56.224
Our collective optimism is reflected
by the growth of biotechnology

00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:57.522
across the globe,

00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:02.974
striving to utilize scientific knowledge
to cure human diseases.

00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:08.523
Things like cancer, aging,
degenerative diseases;

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:12.879
these are but some
of the undesirables we wish to tame.

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:15.261
I often wonder:

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.446
Why is it that we are having
so much trouble

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.632
trying to solve the problem of cancer?

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:24.350
Is it that we're trying to solve
the problem of cancer,

00:04:24.374 --> 00:04:26.668
and not trying to understand life?

00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:30.845
Life on this planet
shares a common origin,

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:35.922
and I can summarize 3.5 billion years
of the history of life on this planet

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:37.426
in a single slide.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.926
What you see here are representatives
of all known species in our planet.

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.732
In this immensity of life
and biodiversity,

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:47.923
we occupy a rather unremarkable position.

00:04:47.947 --> 00:04:48.963
(Laughter)

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:50.210
Homo sapiens.

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:52.621
The last of our kind.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.681
And though I don't really want
to disparage at all

00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.676
the accomplishments of our species,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.686
as much as we wish it to be so
and often pretend that it is,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.586
we are not the measure of all things.

00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:10.798
We are, however, the measurers
of many things.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:15.057
We relentlessly quantify,
analyze and compare,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:18.861
and some of this is absolutely invaluable
and indeed necessary.

00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:26.048
But this emphasis today on forcing
biological research to specialize

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:28.620
and to produce practical outcomes

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:32.198
is actually restricting our ability
to interrogate life

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:36.305
to unacceptably narrow confines
and unsatisfying depths.

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:42.048
We are measuring an astonishingly
narrow sliver of life,

00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:45.848
and hoping that those numbers
will save all of our lives.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:47.818
How narrow do you ask?

00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:49.446
Well, let me give you a number.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.989
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration recently estimated

00:05:54.013 --> 00:05:57.940
that about 95 percent of our oceans
remain unexplored.

00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:00.386
Now let that sink in for a second.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.877
95 percent of our oceans
remain unexplored.

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:07.877
I think it's very safe to say

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:12.730
that we don't even know
how much about life we do not know.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.735
So, it's not surprising
that every week in my field

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.970
we begin to see the addition
of more and more new species

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:22.253
to this amazing tree of life.

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:23.674
This one for example --

00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:25.604
discovered earlier this summer,

00:06:25.628 --> 00:06:26.841
new to science,

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:30.157
and now occupying its lonely branch
in our family tree.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.124
What is even more tragic

00:06:32.148 --> 00:06:35.783
is that we know about a bunch
of other species of animals out there,

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:39.368
but their biology remains
sorely under-studied.

00:06:39.392 --> 00:06:41.726
I'm sure some of you
have heard about the fact

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.946
that a starfish can actually
regenerate its arm after it's lost.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.412
But some of you might not know

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:51.785
that the arm itself can actually
regenerate a complete starfish.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.807
And there are animals out there
that do truly astounding things.

00:06:57.461 --> 00:06:59.171
I'm almost willing to bet

00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:03.514
that many of you have never heard
of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.522
This little guy right here

00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:09.620
does things that essentially
just blow my mind.

00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.135
You can grab one of these animals
and cut it into 18 different fragments,

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.921
and each and every one of those fragments
will go on to regenerate

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:19.263
a complete animal

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:20.921
in under two weeks.

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:25.931
18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.

00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:28.744
For the past decade and a half or so,

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:32.478
I've been trying to figure out
how these little dudes do what they do,

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:34.701
and how they pull this magic trick off.

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:36.439
But like all good magicians,

00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:39.318
they're not really releasing
their secrets readily to me.

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:40.548
(Laughter)

00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:41.730
So here we are,

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:46.209
after 20 years of essentially
studying these animals,

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.540
genome mapping, chin scratching,

00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:51.783
and thousands of amputations
and thousands of regenerations,

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:55.602
we still don't fully understand
how these animals do what they do.

00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:59.624
Each planarian an ocean unto itself,

00:07:59.648 --> 00:08:01.254
full of unknowns.

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:04.160
One of the common characteristics

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.796
of all of these animals
I've been talking to you about

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.583
is that they did not appear
to have received the memo

00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:12.274
that they need to behave
according to the rules

00:08:12.298 --> 00:08:16.467
that we have derived from a handful
of randomly selected animals

00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:19.213
that currently populate the vast majority

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.754
of biomedical laboratories
across the world.

00:08:22.117 --> 00:08:24.347
Meet our Nobel Prize winners.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.373
Seven species, essentially,

00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:29.999
that have produced for us the brunt
of our understanding

00:08:30.023 --> 00:08:32.490
of biological behavior today.

00:08:33.172 --> 00:08:34.964
This little guy right here --

00:08:34.988 --> 00:08:37.458
three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.

00:08:38.204 --> 00:08:40.960
And yet, after all the attention
they have garnered,

00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:43.044
and all the knowledge they have generated,

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:45.093
as well as the lion's share
of the funding,

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:48.990
here we are standing [before] the same
litany of intractable problems

00:08:49.014 --> 00:08:50.638
and many new challenges.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.035
And that's because, unfortunately,

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:55.673
these seven animals essentially correspond

00:08:55.697 --> 00:09:02.473
to 0.0009 percent of all of the species
that inhabit the planet.

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:06.348
So I'm beginning to suspect

00:09:06.372 --> 00:09:11.133
that our specialization is beginning
to impede our progress at best,

00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:13.584
and at worst, is leading us astray.

00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:17.309
That's because life
on this planet and its history

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.050
is the history of rule breakers.

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.780
Life started on the face of this planet
as single-cell organisms,

00:09:22.804 --> 00:09:25.126
swimming for millions
of years in the ocean,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.436
until one of those creatures decided,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.519
"I'm going to do things differently today;

00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:32.551
today I would like to invent
something called multicellularity,

00:09:32.575 --> 00:09:33.848
and I'm going to do this."

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:36.524
And I'm sure it wasn't a popular
decision at the time --

00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:37.575
(Laughter)

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:39.205
but somehow, it managed to do it.

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:41.795
And then, multicellular
organisms began to populate

00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:43.195
all these ancestral oceans,

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:44.407
and they thrived.

00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:45.964
And we have them here today.

00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:49.786
Land masses began to emerge
from the surface of the oceans,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.264
and another creature thought,

00:09:51.288 --> 00:09:54.077
"Hey, that looks like a really nice
piece of real estate.

00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:55.352
I'd like to move there."

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:56.535
"Are you crazy?

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.843
You're going to desiccate out there.
Nothing can live out of water."

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.024
But life found a way,

00:10:01.048 --> 00:10:03.371
and there are organisms
now that live on land.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.793
Once on land, they may have
looked up into the sky

00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:08.076
and said, "It would be nice
to go to the clouds,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.251
I'm going to fly."

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.350
"You can't break the law of gravity,
there's no way you can fly."

00:10:12.374 --> 00:10:14.659
And yet, nature has invented --

00:10:14.683 --> 00:10:16.690
multiple and independent times --

00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:17.921
ways to fly.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.885
I love to study these animals
that break the rules,

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:24.538
because every time they break a rule,
they invent something new

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:28.321
that made it possible for us
to be able to be here today.

00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:30.894
These animals did not get the memo.

00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:32.618
They break the rules.

00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:35.437
So if we're going to study animals
that break the rules,

00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:38.456
shouldn't how we study them
also break the rules?

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:43.054
I think we need to renew
our spirit of exploration.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.924
Rather than bring nature
into our laboratories

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:47.263
and interrogate it there,

00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:48.993
we need to bring our science

00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:51.922
into the majestic laboratory
that is nature,

00:10:51.946 --> 00:10:55.857
and there, with our modern
technological armamentarium,

00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:58.707
interrogate every new form
of life we find,

00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:01.724
and any new biological attribute
that we may find.

00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:06.640
We actually need to bring
all of our intelligence

00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:08.756
to becoming stupid again --

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.639
clueless [before] the immensity
of the unknown.

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:14.477
Because after all,

00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:16.660
science is not really about knowledge.

00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:19.425
Science is about ignorance.

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:20.814
That's what we do.

00:11:20.838 --> 00:11:23.969
Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,

00:11:23.993 --> 00:11:25.794
"If you want to build a ship,

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.762
don't drum up people to collect wood

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.088
and don't assign them tasks and work,

00:11:30.112 --> 00:11:34.206
but rather teach them to long
for the endless immensity of the sea ..."

00:11:34.646 --> 00:11:36.350
As a scientist and a teacher,

00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:38.335
I like to paraphrase this to read

00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:41.517
that we scientists need
to teach our students

00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:43.992
to long for the endless
immensity of the sea

00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:45.453
that is our ignorance.

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:50.633
We Homo sapiens are the only
species we know of

00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:53.093
that is driven to scientific inquiry.

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:55.779
We, like all other species on this planet,

00:11:55.803 --> 00:12:00.294
are inextricably woven
into the history of life on this planet.

00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:04.156
And I think I'm a little wrong
when I say that life is a mystery,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.891
because I think that life
is actually an open secret

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:10.899
that has been beckoning our species
for millennia to understand it.

00:12:11.344 --> 00:12:12.945
So I ask you:

00:12:12.969 --> 00:12:16.742
Aren't we the best chance
that life has to know itself?

00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:18.204
And if so,

00:12:18.228 --> 00:12:19.958
what the heck are we waiting for?

00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:21.569
Thank you.

00:12:21.593 --> 00:12:24.847
(Applause)
