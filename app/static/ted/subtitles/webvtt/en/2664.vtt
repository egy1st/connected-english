00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.735
How many of you have used
an electronic spreadsheet,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.240
like Microsoft Excel?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.496
Very good.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.096
Now, how many of you have run a business
with a spreadsheet by hand,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.200
like my dad did for his small
printing business in Philadelphia?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.320
A lot less.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.520
Well, that's the way it was done
for hundreds of years.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.496
In early 1978,
I started working on an idea

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.920
that eventually became VisiCalc.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.136
And the next year it shipped

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.439
running on something new
called an Apple II personal computer.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.296
You could tell that things
had really changed when, six years later,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.496
the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800
that assumed you knew what VisiCalc was
and maybe even were using it.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.720
Steve Jobs back in 1990

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.400
said that "spreadsheets
propelled the industry forward."

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.800
"VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple
more than any other single event."

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.600
On a more personal note,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.736
Steve said, "If VisiCalc had been written
for some other computer,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.960
you'd be interviewing
somebody else right now."

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.736
So, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting
personal computers on business desks.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.920
How did it come about?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.600
What was it? What did I go through
to make it be what it was?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.256
Well, I first learned to program
back in 1966, when I was 15 --

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520
just a couple months
after this photo was taken.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.160
Few high schoolers had access
to computers in those days.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.056
But through luck
and an awful lot of perseverance,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.320
I was able to get
computer time around the city.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.080
After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock,
I went off to MIT to go to college,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600
where to make money,
I worked on the Multics Project.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.336
Multics was a trailblazing
interactive time-sharing system.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.536
Have you heard of the Linux
and Unix operating systems?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.800
They came from Multics.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.616
I worked on the Multics versions

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.456
of what are known
as interpreted computer languages,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.936
that are used by people
in noncomputer fields

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
to do their calculations
while seated at a computer terminal.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.816
After I graduated from MIT,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.680
I went to work for
Digital Equipment Corporation.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.496
At DEC, I worked on software

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360
for the new area
of computerized typesetting.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.136
I helped newspapers
replace their reporters' typewriters

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.360
with computer terminals.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.096
I'd write software

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.816
and then I'd go out in the field
to places like the Kansas City Star,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.256
where I would train users
and get feedback.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.136
This was real-world experience

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.400
that is quite different
than what I saw in the lab at MIT.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.496
After that, I was project leader

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.320
of the software for DEC's first
word processor, again a new field.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.216
Like with typesetting, the important thing
was crafting a user interface

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.320
that was both natural and efficient
for noncomputer people to use.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.336
After I was at DEC, I went
to work for a small company

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.480
that made microprocessor-based electronic
cash registers for the fast-food industry.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.056
But I had always wanted to start
a company with my friend Bob Frankston

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.456
that I met on the Multics project at MIT.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.176
So I decided to go back to school to learn
as much as I could about business.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.976
And in the fall of 1977,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I entered the MBA program
at Harvard Business School.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.336
I was one of the few
percentage of students

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.200
who had a background
in computer programming.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.256
There's a picture of me from the yearbook
sitting in the front row.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.296
(Laughter)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.936
Now, at Harvard,
we learned by the case method.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.896
We'd do about three cases a day.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.640
Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages
describing particular business situations.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.176
They often have exhibits,
and exhibits often have words and numbers

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.360
laid out in ways that make sense
for the particular situation.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.776
They're usually all somewhat different.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.016
Here's my homework.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.216
Again, numbers, words,
laid out in ways that made sense.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.320
Lots of calculations --
we got really close to our calculators.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.600
In fact, here's my calculator.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.976
For Halloween, I went
dressed up as a calculator.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.440
(Laughter)

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:16.976
At the beginning of each class,
the professor would call on somebody

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.279
to present the case.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.856
What they would do is
they would explain what was going on

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.616
and then dictate information
that the professor would transcribe

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.545
onto the many motorized blackboards
in the front of the class,

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.096
and then we'd have a discussion.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.576
One of the really frustrating things
is when you've done all your homework,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.616
you come in the next day
only to find out that you made an error

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.176
and all of the other numbers
you did were wrong.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.976
And you couldn't participate as well.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240
And we were marked by class participation.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.240
So, sitting there with 87 other people
in the class, I got to daydream a lot.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.136
Most programmers in those days
worked on mainframes,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.496
building things like inventory systems,
payroll systems and bill-paying systems.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.016
But I had worked
on interactive word processing

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.136
and on-demand personal computation.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.440
Instead of thinking
about paper printouts and punch cards,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.656
I imagined a magic blackboard

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.056
that if you erased one number
and wrote a new thing in,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.936
all of the other numbers
would automatically change,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.720
like word processing with numbers.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.840
I imagined that my calculator
had mouse hardware on the bottom of it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200
and a head-up display,
like in a fighter plane.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.856
And I could type some numbers in,
and circle it, and press the sum button.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.616
And right in the middle of a negotiation
I'd be able to get the answer.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.640
Now I just had to take my fantasy
and turn it into reality.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.080
My father taught me about prototyping.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.176
He showed me mock-ups

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.536
that he'd make to figure out
the placement on the page

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.096
for the things for brochures
that he was printing.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.056
And he'd use it
to get feedback from customers

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.680
and OKs before he sent the job
off to the presses.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.536
The act of making a simple, working
version of what you're trying to build

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.880
forces you to uncover key problems.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.120
And it lets you find solutions
to those problems much less expensively.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.960
So I decided to build a prototype.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.336
I went to a video terminal connected to
Harvard's time-sharing system

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.856
and got to work.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.136
One of the first problems
that I ran into was:

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.840
How do you represent values in formulas?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.640
Let me show you what I mean.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.176
I thought that you would point somewhere,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.296
type in some words,
then type in some somewhere else,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.844
put in some numbers and some more numbers,
point where you want the answer.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.456
And then point to the first, press minus,
point to the second,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
and get the result.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.776
The problem was:
What should I put in the formula?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.420
It had to be something
the computer knew what to put in.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:54.136
And if you looked at the formula,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160
you needed to know
where on the screen it referred to.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.736
The first thing I thought was
the programmer way of doing it.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.665
The first time you pointed to somewhere,

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.369
the computer would ask you
to type in a unique name.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.536
It became pretty clear pretty fast that
that was going to be too tedious.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.800
The computer had to automatically
make up the name and put it inside.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.960
So I thought, why not make it be
the order in which you create them?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.976
I tried that. Value 1, value 2.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.762
Pretty quickly I saw
that if you had more than a few values

00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:27.296
you'd never remember
on the screen where things were.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.616
Then I said, why not instead of
allowing you to put values anywhere,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.240
I'll restrict you to a grid?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.936
Then when you pointed to a cell,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.680
the computer could put
the row and column in as a name.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.816
And, if I did it like a map and put ABC
across the top and numbers along the side,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.736
if you saw B7 in a formula,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.960
you'd know exactly
where it was on the screen.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.880
And if you had to type the formula
in yourself, you'd know what to do.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.520
Restricting you to a grid
helped solve my problem.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.800
It also opened up new capabilities,
like the ability to have ranges of cells.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.936
But it wasn't too restrictive --

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.280
you could still put any value,
any formula, in any cell.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.960
And that's the way we do it to this day,
almost 40 years later.

00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:22.776
My friend Bob and I decided that we were
going to build this product together.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.216
I did more work figuring out exactly
how the program was supposed to behave.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.496
I wrote a reference card
to act as documentation.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.296
It also helped me ensure
that the user interface I was defining

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.799
could be explained concisely
and clearly to regular people.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.936
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment
he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.680
This is the inside of the attic.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.016
Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.760
to write computer code
on a terminal like this.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.896
And then he would download test versions
to a borrowed Apple II

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.176
over a phone line
using an acoustic coupler,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360
and then we would test.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.640
For one of these tests I prepared
for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.640
Print wasn't working yet,
so I had to copy everything down.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.896
Save wasn't working,
so every time it crashed,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.920
I had to type in all of the formulas
again, over and over again.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.216
The next day in class, I raised my hand;
I got called on, and I presented the case.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.816
I did five-year projections.
I did all sorts of different scenarios.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.520
I aced the case.
VisiCalc was already useful.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.760
The professor said, "How did you do it?"

00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:36.136
Well, I didn't want to tell him
about our secret program.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.680
(Laughter)

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.056
So I said, "I took this and added this

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.176
and multiplied by this
and subtracted that."

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.296
He said, "Well,
why didn't you use a ratio?"

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.336
I said, "Hah! A ratio --
that wouldn't have been as exact!"

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.936
What I didn't say was,
"Divide isn't working yet."

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.056
(Laughter)

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.936
Eventually, though,
we did finish enough of VisiCalc

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.800
to be able to show it to the public.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.416
My dad printed up a sample reference card

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.440
that we could use as marketing material.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.056
In June of 1979, our publisher
announced VisiCalc to the world,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.200
in a small booth at the giant National
Computer Conference in New York City.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960
The New York Times had
a humorous article about the conference.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.936
"The machines perform
what seem religious rites ...

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.341
Even as the believers gather,

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:26.461
the painters in the Coliseum sign room
are adding to the pantheon,

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:29.656
carefully lettering 'VISICALC'
in giant black on yellow.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.496
All hail VISICALC!"

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.096
(Gasp) New York Times:
"All hail VISICALC."

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.616
(Laughter)

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.896
That was the last mention
of the electronic spreadsheet

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.816
in the popular business press
for about two years.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.976
Most people didn't get it yet.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.200
But some did.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.120
In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.696
It came in packaging
that looked like this.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.200
And it looked like this
running on the Apple II.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.960
And the rest, as they say, is history.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.456
Now, there's an awful lot
more to this story,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.536
but that'll have to wait for another day.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.800
One thing, though, Harvard remembers.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.600
Here's that classroom.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.680
They put up a plaque
to commemorate what happened there.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.040
(Applause)

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.336
But it also serves as a reminder

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.856
that you, too, should take
your unique backgrounds, skills and needs

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.136
and build prototypes to discover
and work out the key problems,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.280
and through that, change the world.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.256
Thank you.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.880
(Applause)
