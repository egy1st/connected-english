00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.376
So earlier this year,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.216
I was informed that I would be
doing a TED Talk.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.216
So I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.256
then I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.816
and in between the excitement
and the panicking,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.136
I started to do my research,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.616
and my research primarily consisted
of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.856
(Laughter)

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.536
And interspersed with that,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.256
I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.896
How many of you know who that is?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.696
(Cheers)

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.055
So I was Googling her
because I always Google her

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.336
because I'm just a fan,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.976
but also because she always has
important and interesting things to say.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.456
And the combination of those searches

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.096
kept leading me to her talk

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.296
on the dangers of a single story,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.696
on what happens
when we have a solitary lens

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.216
through which to understand
certain groups of people,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.200
and it is the perfect talk.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.056
It's the talk that I would have given
if I had been famous first.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.256
(Laughter)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.656
You know, and you know,
like, she's African and I'm African,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.616
and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.816
and she's a storyteller
and I'm a storyteller,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.656
so I really felt like it's my talk.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.416
(Laughter)

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.736
So I decided that I was going
to learn how to code,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.776
and then I was going to hack the internet

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.536
and I would take down all the copies
of that talk that existed,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.976
and then I would memorize it,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.256
and then I would come here
and deliver it as if it was my own speech.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.456
So that plan was going really well,
except the coding part,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.376
and then one morning a few months ago,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.976
I woke up

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.456
to the news that the wife
of a certain presidential candidate

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.456
had given a speech that --

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.416
(Laughter)

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.000
(Applause)

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.576
that sounded eerily like a speech
given by one of my other faves,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.816
Michelle Obama.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.936
(Cheers)

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.976
And so I decided that I should
probably write my own TED Talk,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.496
and so that is what I am here to do.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840
I'm here to talk about
my own observations about storytelling.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.616
I want to talk to you
about the power of stories, of course,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.576
but I also want to talk
about their limitations,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.640
particularly for those of us
who are interested in social justice.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.176
So since Adichie gave that talk
seven years ago,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.456
there has been a boom in storytelling.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.216
Stories are everywhere,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.176
and if there was a danger
in the telling of one tired old tale,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.536
then I think there has got to be
lots to celebrate about the flourishing

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.336
of so many stories and so many voices.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.160
Stories are the antidote to bias.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.016
In fact, today, if you are middle class
and connected via the internet,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.176
you can download stories
at the touch of a button

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.576
or the swipe of a screen.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.416
You can listen to a podcast

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.336
about what it's like
to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.856
You can hear an indigenous
man in Australia

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.976
talk about the trials and triumphs
of raising his children in dignity

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.336
and in pride.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.336
Stories make us fall in love.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.536
They heal rifts and they bridge divides.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.416
Stories can even make it easier for us

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.096
to talk about the deaths
of people in our societies

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.576
who don't matter,
because they make us care.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.800
Right?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.056
I'm not so sure,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.160
and I actually work for a place
called the Centre for Stories.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.256
And my job is to help to tell stories

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.816
that challenge mainstream narratives
about what it means to be black

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.896
or a Muslim or a refugee
or any of those other categories

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.936
that we talk about all the time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.176
But I come to this work

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.696
after a long history
as a social justice activist,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.856
and so I'm really interested in the ways

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.576
that people talk
about nonfiction storytelling

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.936
as though it's about
more than entertainment,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920
as though it's about being
a catalyst for social action.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.216
It's not uncommon to hear people say

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.240
that stories make
the world a better place.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.176
Increasingly, though, I worry
that even the most poignant stories,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.136
particularly the stories about people
who no one seems to care about,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.576
can often get in the way
of action towards social justice.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.416
Now, this is not because
storytellers mean any harm.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.696
Quite the contrary.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.960
Storytellers are often do-gooders
like me and, I suspect, yourselves.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.656
And the audiences of storytellers

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.920
are often deeply compassionate
and empathetic people.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.176
Still, good intentions
can have unintended consequences,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.240
and so I want to propose that stories
are not as magical as they seem.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.576
So three -- because
it's always got to be three --

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.816
three reasons why I think

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.520
that stories don't necessarily
make the world a better place.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.376
Firstly, stories can create
an illusion of solidarity.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.936
There is nothing
like that feel-good factor you get

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.096
from listening to a fantastic story

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.496
where you feel like you
climbed that mountain, right,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.360
or that you befriended
that death row inmate.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.256
But you didn't.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.096
You haven't done anything.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.896
Listening is an important

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.880
but insufficient step
towards social action.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.976
Secondly, I think often we are drawn

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.936
towards characters and protagonists

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.416
who are likable and human.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.336
And this makes sense, of course, right?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.416
Because if you like someone,
then you care about them.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.840
But the inverse is also true.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.176
If you don't like someone,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.136
then you don't care about them.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.016
And if you don't care about them,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.936
you don't have to see yourself
as having a moral obligation

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.200
to think about the circumstances
that shaped their lives.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.296
I learned this lesson
when I was 14 years old.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.096
I learned that actually,
you don't have to like someone

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.496
to recognize their wisdom,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.616
and you certainly
don't have to like someone

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
to take a stand by their side.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.600
So my bike was stolen

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.976
while I was riding it --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.136
(Laughter)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.736
which is possible if you're
riding slowly enough, which I was.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.256
(Laughter)

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.256
So one minute
I'm cutting across this field

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.576
in the Nairobi neighborhood
where I grew up,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.056
and it's like a very bumpy path,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.896
and so when you're riding a bike,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.176
you don't want to be like, you know --

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.600
(Laughter)

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.776
And so I'm going like this,
slowly pedaling,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.376
and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.576
I'm on the ground, and I look up,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.376
and there's this kid peddling away
in the getaway vehicle,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.896
which is my bike,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.176
and he's about 11 or 12 years old,
and I'm on the floor,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.056
and I'm crying because I saved
a lot of money for that bike,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.656
and I'm crying and I stand up
and I start screaming.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.936
Instinct steps in,
and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!"

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.600
which means "thief" in Swahili.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.576
And out of the woodworks,
all of these people come out

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.016
and they start to give chase.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.296
This is Africa, so mob justice in action.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.776
Right?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.576
And I round the corner,
and they've captured him,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.056
they've caught him.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.136
The suspect has been apprehended,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.736
and they make him give me my bike back,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.376
and they also make him apologize.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.976
Again, you know,
typical African justice, right?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.496
And so they make him say sorry.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.856
And so we stand there facing each other,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.816
and he looks at me, and he says sorry,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.336
but he looks at me
with this unbridled fury.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.400
He is very, very angry.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.496
And it is the first time that I have been
confronted with someone

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.136
who doesn't like me
simply because of what I represent.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.216
He looks at me
with this look as if to say,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.120
"You, with your shiny skin
and your bike, you're angry at me?"

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.496
So it was a hard lesson
that he didn't like me,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.576
but you know what, he was right.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.096
I was a middle-class kid
living in a poor country.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.360
I had a bike, and he barely had food.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.696
Sometimes, it's the messages
that we don't want to hear,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.216
the ones that make us
want to crawl out of ourselves,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.816
that we need to hear the most.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.016
For every lovable storyteller
who steals your heart,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.416
there are hundreds more
whose voices are slurred and ragged,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.120
who don't get to stand up on a stage
dressed in fine clothes like this.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.936
There are a million
angry-boy-on-a-bike stories

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.616
and we can't afford to ignore them

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.776
simply because we don't like
their protagonists

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.736
or because that's not the kid
that we would bring home with us

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.960
from the orphanage.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.456
The third reason that I think

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.096
that stories don't necessarily
make the world a better place

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.576
is that too often we are so invested
in the personal narrative

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.440
that we forget
to look at the bigger picture.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.776
And so we applaud someone

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.456
when they tell us
about their feelings of shame,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.640
but we don't necessarily
link that to oppression.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.736
We nod understandingly
when someone says they felt small,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.800
but we don't link that to discrimination.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.416
The most important stories,
especially for social justice,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.256
are those that do both,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.040
that are both personal and allow us
to explore and understand the political.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.936
But it's not just
about the stories we like

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.856
versus the stories we choose to ignore.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.816
Increasingly, we are living in a society
where there are larger forces at play,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.200
where stories are actually for many people
beginning to replace the news.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.856
Yeah?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.256
We live in a time where we are witnessing
the decline of facts,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.496
when emotions rule

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.616
and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.840
Where we value what we feel
more than what we actually know.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.336
A recent report by the Pew Center
on trends in America

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.136
indicates that only 10 percent
of young adults under the age of 30

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.536
"place a lot of trust in the media."

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.360
Now, this is significant.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.456
It means that storytellers
are gaining trust

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.856
at precisely the same moment

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.200
that many in the media
are losing the confidence in the public.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.616
This is not a good thing,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.416
because while stories are important

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.656
and they help us
to have insights in many ways,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.536
we need the media.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.056
From my years
as a social justice activist,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.176
I know very well that we need
credible facts from media institutions

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.216
combined with the powerful voices
of storytellers.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.760
That's what pushes the needle forward
in terms of social justice.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.560
In the final analysis, of course,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.296
it is justice

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.056
that makes the world a better place,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.040
not stories. Right?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.136
And so if it is justice that we are after,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.576
then I think we mustn't focus
on the media or on storytellers.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.296
We must focus on audiences,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.416
on anyone who has ever turned on a radio

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.256
or listened to a podcast,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.376
and that means all of us.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.536
So a few concluding thoughts

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.440
on what audiences can do
to make the world a better place.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.936
So firstly, the world
would be a better place, I think,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.536
if audiences were more curious
and more skeptical

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.176
and asked more questions
about the social context

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.280
that created those stories
that they love so much.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.456
Secondly, the world
would be a better place

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.160
if audiences recognized
that storytelling is intellectual work.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.576
And I think it would
be important for audiences

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.936
to demand more buttons
on their favorite websites,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.656
buttons for example that say,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.296
"If you liked this story,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.376
click here to support a cause
your storyteller believes in."

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.560
Or "click here to contribute
to your storyteller's next big idea."

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.056
Often, we are committed to the platforms,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.536
but not necessarily
to the storytellers themselves.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.656
And then lastly, I think that audiences
can make the world a better place

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.760
by switching off their phones,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.576
by stepping away from their screens

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.080
and stepping out into the real world
beyond what feels safe.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.856
Alice Walker has said,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.656
"Look closely at the present
you are constructing.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.840
It should look like the future
you are dreaming."

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.856
Storytellers can help us to dream,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.680
but it's up to all of us
to have a plan for justice.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.696
Thank you.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.070
