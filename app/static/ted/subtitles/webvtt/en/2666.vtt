00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.456
[This talk contains graphic language
and descriptions of sexual violence]

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.909
[Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.933
"Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.320
"You can't sue someone
for calling them a cunt."

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.720
"If you can't handle the Internet,
fuck off, whore."

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.696
"I wish Ashley Judd
would die a horrible death.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.096
She is the absolute worst."

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.320
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason
women shouldn't vote."

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.576
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.320
I don't even want to rape it."

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.736
"Whatever you do,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.920
don't tell Ashley Judd.
She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.936
"If I had to fuck an older woman,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.216
oh my God,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.416
I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.696
that bitch is hot af.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.560
The unforgivable shit I would do to her."

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Online misogyny is a global
gender rights tragedy,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.056
and it is imperative that it ends.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.280
(Applause)

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.416
Girls' and women's voices,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.256
and our allies' voices
are constrained in ways

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.296
that are personally, economically,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.936
professionally and politically damaging.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
And when we curb abuse,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.720
we will expand freedom.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.016
I am a Kentucky basketball fan,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.096
so on a fine March day last year,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.696
I was doing one of the things I do best:

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.656
I was cheering for my Wildcats.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.056
The daffodils were blooming,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.536
but the referees were not blowing
the whistle when I was telling them to.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.816
(Laughter)

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.576
Funny, they're very friendly
to me before the opening tip,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.656
but they really ignore me during the game.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.696
(Laughter)

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.176
Three of my players were bleeding,
so I did the next best thing ...

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.416
I tweeted.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.616
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss
my team's free throw making a --

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.576
@KySportsRadio @marchmadness
@espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.256
It is routine for me to be treated
in the ways I've already described to you.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.896
It happens to me every single day

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.536
on social media platforms
such as Twitter and Facebook.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.936
Since I joined Twitter in 2011,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.976
misogyny and misogynists
have amply demonstrated

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.976
they will dog my every step.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.376
My spirituality, my faith,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.686
being a hillbilly --
I can say that, you can't --

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.870
all of it is fair game.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.056
And I have responded to this
with various strategies.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.416
I've tried engaging people.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.056
This one guy was sending me
hypersexual, nasty stuff,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.736
and there was a girl in his avatar.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.440
I wrote him back and said ...

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.000
"Is that your daughter?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.216
I feel a lot of fear
that you may think about

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.896
and talk to women this way."

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.376
And he surprised me by saying,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.816
"You know what?
You're right. I apologize."

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.280
Sometimes people
want to be held accountable.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.056
This one guy was musing
to I don't know who

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.120
that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.776
I was married to a Scot for 14 years,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.376
so I said, "Cunt means many
different things in different countries --

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.616
(Laughter)

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.736
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize
the global standard of a dick."

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.976
(Laughter)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.160
(Applause)

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.496
I've tried to rise above it,
I've tried to get in the trenches,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.456
but mostly I would scroll through
these social media platforms

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.096
with one eye partially closed,
trying not to see it,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360
but you can't make
a cucumber out of a pickle.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.736
What is seen goes in.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.960
It's traumatic.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.096
And I was always secretly hoping
in some part of me

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.760
that what was being said to me
and about me wasn't ...

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.440
true.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.136
Because even I,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.320
an avowed, self-declared feminist,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.320
who worships at the altar of Gloria --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.440
(Laughter)

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.120
internalize the patriarchy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.536
This is really critical.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.336
Patriarchy is not boys and men.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.096
It is a system
in which we all participate,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.320
including me.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.416
On that particular day, for some reason,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.976
that particular tweet
after the basketball game

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.576
triggered something called a "cyber mob."

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.616
This vitriolic, global outpouring
of the most heinous hate speech:

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.576
death threats, rape threats.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.815
And don't you know,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.176
when I was sitting at home
alone in my nightgown,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.896
I got a phone call,
and it was my beloved former husband,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.256
and he said on a voice mail,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.480
"Loved one ...

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
what is happening to you is not OK."

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.280
And there was something about him
taking a stand for me that night ...

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.696
that allowed me
to take a stand for myself.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.960
And I started to write.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.376
I started to write about sharing the fact

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.736
that I'm a survivor
of all forms of sexual abuse,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.176
including three rapes.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.456
And the hate speech
I get in response to that --

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.880
these are just some of the comments
posted to news outlets.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.840
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.056
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.296
Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.136
Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus.
May your grace and mercy shine.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.840
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed,
it is entitled,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.256
"Forget Your Team:

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.096
It Is Your Online Gender Violence
Toward Girls And Women

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.616
That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.176
(Laughter)

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.200
(Applause)

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:26.656
And I did that alone,
and I published it alone,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.136
because my chief advisor said,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.376
"Please don't,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.176
the rain of retaliatory garbage
that is inevitable --

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.616
I fear for you."

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.736
But I trust girls and I trust women,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.336
and I trust our allies.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.016
It was published, it went viral,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.136
it proves that every single day

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.656
online misogyny is a phenomenon
endured by us all,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.896
all over the world,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.656
and when it is intersectional,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.896
it is worse.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.856
Sexual orientation, gender identity,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.696
race, ethnicity, religion --

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.936
you name it,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.496
it amplifies the violence
endured by girls and women,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.760
and for our younger girls, it is worse.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.816
It's clearly traumatizing.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.016
Our mental health,
our emotional well-being

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.496
are so gravely affected

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.976
because the threat of violence

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.216
is experienced
neurobiologically as violence.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.296
The cortisol shoots up,
the limbic system gets fired,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.400
we lose productivity at work.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.656
And let's talk about work.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.600
Our ability to work is constrained.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.896
Online searches of women applying for jobs
reveal nude pictures of them,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.506
false allegations they have STDs,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.976
their addresses indicating
that they are available for sex

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.536
with real examples

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.200
of people showing up
at this house for said sex.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.400
Our ability to go to school is impaired.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.536
96 percent of all postings

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.680
of sexual images of our young people ...

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.016
girls.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.240
Our girls.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.536
Our boys are two to three
times more likely --

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.920
nonconsensually --

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.360
to share images.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.680
And I want to say a word
about revenge porn.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.656
Part of what came out of this tweet

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.496
was my getting connected
with allies and other activists

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.120
who are fighting
for a safe and free internet.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.416
We started something
called the Speech Project;

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.936
curbing abuse, expanding freedom.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.640
And that website
provides a critical forum,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.080
because there is no global, legal thing

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.336
to help us figure this out.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.976
But we do provide on that website
a standardized list of definitions,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.096
because it's hard to attack
a behavior in the right way

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.536
if we're not all sharing
a definition of what that behavior is.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.336
And I learned that revenge porn
is often dangerously misapplied.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.080
It is the nonconsensual
sharing of an image

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.136
used tactically to shame
and humiliate a girl or woman

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.776
that attempts to pornography us.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.656
Our natural sexuality is --

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.480
I don't know about yours --
pretty gorgeous and wonderful.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.520
And my expressing it
does not pornography make.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.120
(Applause)

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.696
So, I have all these resources

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.040
that I'm keenly aware
so many people in the world do not.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.640
I was able to start
the Speech Project with colleagues.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.816
I can often get a social media
company's attention.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.800
I have a wonderful visit
to Facebook HQ coming up.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.880
Hasn't helped the idiotic
reporting standards yet ...

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.000
I actually pay someone
to scrub my social media feeds,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.936
attempting to spare my brain

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.176
the daily iterations
of the trauma of hate speech.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.416
And guess what?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.816
I get hate speech for that.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.460
"Oh, you live in an echo chamber."

00:08:55.484 --> 00:08:56.736
Well, guess what?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.456
Having someone post a photograph
of me with my mouth open

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.536
saying they "can't wait
to cum on my face,"

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.320
I have a right to set that boundary.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.600
(Applause)

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.736
And this distinction
between virtual and real is specious

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.976
because guess what --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.496
that actually happened to me
once when I was a child,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.096
and so that tweet brought up that trauma,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.896
and I had to do work on that.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.096
But you know what we do?
We take all of this hate speech,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.000
and we disaggregate it,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.216
and we code it,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.096
and we give that data

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.816
so that we understand
the intersectionality of it:

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.096
when I get porn,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.976
when it's about political affiliation,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.200
when it's about age,
when it's about all of it.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.840
We're going to win this fight.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.440
There are a lot of solutions --

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.920
thank goodness.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.496
I'm going to offer just a few,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.160
and of course I challenge you
to create and contribute your own.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.616
Number one: we have to start
with digital media literacy,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.176
and clearly it must have a gendered lens.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.696
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.920
it's essential.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.600
Two ...

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.560
shall we talk about our friends in tech?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.600
Said with dignity and respect,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.256
the sexism in your workplaces must end.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.736
(Applause)

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.960
(Cheers)

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.976
EDGE,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.856
the global standard for gender equality,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.416
is the minimum standard.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.656
And guess what, Silicon Valley?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.656
If L'Oréal in India,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.856
in the Philippines, in Brazil

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.776
and in Russia can do it,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.840
you can, too.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.160
Enough excuses.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.976
Only when women have critical mass
in every department at your companies,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.816
including building platforms
from the ground up,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.176
will the conversations
about priorities and solutions change.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.256
And more love for my friends in tech:

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.200
profiteering off misogyny
in video games must end.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.256
I'm so tired of hearing you
talk to me at cocktail parties --

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.616
like you did a couple
weeks ago in Aspen --

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.576
about how deplorable #Gamergate was,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.216
when you're still making
billions of dollars off games

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.456
that maim and dump women for sport.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.016
Basta! -- as the Italians would say.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.296
Enough.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.040
(Applause)

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.736
Our friends in law enforcement
have much to do,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.376
because we've seen

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.840
that online violence
is an extension of in-person violence.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.976
In our country,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
more girls and women have been
murdered by their intimate partners

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.576
than died on 9/11

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.216
and have died since
in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.336
And it's not cool to say that,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.560
but it is true.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.256
We care so much geopolitically
about what men are doing over there

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.480
to women over there ...

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.920
In 2015,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.096
72,828 women used intimate
partner violence services in this country.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.560
That is not counting the girls
and women and boys who needed them.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.520
Law enforcement must be empowered

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.496
with up-to-date internet technology,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.736
the devices and an understanding
of these platforms --

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.960
how they work.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.216
The police wanted to be helpful
when Amanda Hess called

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.776
about the death threat
she was getting on Twitter,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.936
but they couldn't really when they said,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.160
"What's Twitter?"

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.536
Our legislators must write
and pass astute legislation

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.456
that reflects today's technology

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.680
and our notions of free and hate speech.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.816
In New York recently, the law
could not be applied to a perpetrator

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.016
because the crimes
must have been committed --

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.376
even if it was anonymous --

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.856
they must have been committed
by telephone, in mail,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.296
by telegraph --

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.800
(Laughter)

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.440
The language must be
technologically neutral.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.176
So apparently,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.000
I've got a pretty bold voice.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.235
So, let's talk about our friends ...

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.280
white men.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.760
You have a role to play
and a choice to make.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.776
You can do something,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.080
or you can do nothing.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.536
We're cool in this room,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.560
but when this goes out, everyone will say,

00:13:27.584 --> 00:13:29.304
"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.096
That quote was said
by a white man, Robert Moritz,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.536
chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.600
he asked me to include it in my talk.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.840
We need to grow support lines
and help groups,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.440
so victims can help each other

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.056
when their lives and finances
have been derailed.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.456
We must as individuals disrupt
gender violence as it is happening.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.256
92 percent of young people

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.080
29 and under witness it.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.200
72 percent of us have witnessed it.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.816
We must have the courage and urgency

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.520
to practice stopping it
as it is unfolding.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.440
And lastly,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.920
believe her.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.816
Believe her.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.320
(Applause)

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.560
This is fundamentally
a problem of human interaction.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.696
And as I believe that human interaction
is at the core of our healing,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.720
trauma not transformed
will be trauma transferred.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.696
Edith Wharton said,
"The end is latent in the beginning,"

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.696
so we are going to end this talk
replacing hate speech with love speech.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.656
Because I get lonely in this,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.520
but I know that we are allies.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.296
I recently learned

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.936
about how gratitude and affirmations
offset negative interactions.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.416
It takes five of those
to offset one negative interaction,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.896
and gratitude in particular --

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.616
free, available globally
any time, anywhere,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.736
to anyone in any dialect --

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.976
it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.816
a watershed part of the brain

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.456
that floods it with great, good stuff.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.096
So I'm going to say
awesome stuff about myself.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.456
I would like for you
to reflect it back to me.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.616
It might sound something like this --

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.096
(Laughter)

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.136
I am a powerful and strong woman,
and you would say, "Yes, you are."

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.816
Audience: Yes, you are.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.576
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.016
A: Yes, she does.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.096
AJ: I did a great job with my talk.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.736
A: Yes, you did.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.896
AJ: I have a right to be here.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.696
A: Yes, you do.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.936
AJ: I'm really cute.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.216
(Laughter)

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.696
A: Yes, you are.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.456
AJ: God does good work.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.256
A: Yes, He does.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.016
AJ: And I love you.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.360
Thank you so much
for letting me be of service.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.536
Bless you.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.730
(Applause)
