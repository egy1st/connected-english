00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.277
If I asked you to picture the air,

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.451
what do you imagine?

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.398
Most people think about either empty space

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.480
or clear blue sky

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:17.063
or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.530
And then I remember my high school
chemistry teacher with really long socks

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.741
at the blackboard,

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.169
drawing diagrams of bubbles
connected to other bubbles,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.813
and describing how they vibrate
and collide in a kind of frantic soup.

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:35.867
But really, we tend not to think
about the air that much at all.

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.363
We notice it mostly

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.485
when there's some kind of unpleasant
sensory intrusion upon it,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:47.077
like a terrible smell
or something visible like smoke or mist.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.320
But it's always there.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:53.687
It's touching all of us right now.

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:55.368
It's even inside us.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:01.944
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.745
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.563
So what is the air?

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.843
It's the combination of the invisible
gases that envelop the Earth,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.393
attracted by the Earth's
gravitational pull.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.696
And even though I'm a visual artist,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.006
I'm interested in
the invisibility of the air.

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:27.202
I'm interested in how we imagine it,

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:29.274
how we experience it

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:33.112
and how we all have an innate
understanding of its materiality

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:34.476
through breathing.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.190
All life on Earth changes the air
through gas exchange,

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:43.975
and we're all doing it right now.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.647
Actually, why don't we all
right now together take

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.432
one big, collective, deep breath in.

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.835
Ready? In. (Inhales)

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.807
And out. (Exhales)

00:01:58.782 --> 00:02:01.452
That air that you just exhaled,

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:05.160
you enriched a hundred times
in carbon dioxide.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:12.495
So roughly five liters of air per breath,
17 breaths per minute

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.096
of the 525,600 minutes per year,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.580
comes to approximately
45 million liters of air,

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:27.598
enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,

00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:28.928
just for you.

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:34.084
Now, that's equivalent to about 18
Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:38.410
For me, air is plural.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:41.507
It's simultaneously
as small as our breathing

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:43.451
and as big as the planet.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.024
And it's kind of hard to picture.

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:51.509
Maybe it's impossible,
and maybe it doesn't matter.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:54.593
Through my visual arts practice,

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:58.310
I try to make air, not so much picture it,

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:02.455
but to make it visceral
and tactile and haptic.

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:07.984
I try to expand this notion
of the aesthetic, how things look,

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.621
so that it can include things
like how it feels on your skin

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:13.343
and in your lungs,

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.051
and how your voice sounds
as it passes through it.

00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:22.515
I explore the weight, density and smell,
but most importantly,

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.384
I think a lot about the stories we attach
to different kinds of air.

00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:33.944
This is a work I made in 2014.

00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:37.971
It's called "Different Kinds
of Air: A Plant's Diary,"

00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:41.903
where I was recreating the air
from different eras in Earth's evolution,

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:44.927
and inviting the audience
to come in and breathe them with me.

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.565
And it's really surprising,
so drastically different.

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.931
Now, I'm not a scientist,

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:54.931
but atmospheric scientists
will look for traces

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:57.713
in the air chemistry in geology,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.054
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:03.427
and they'll extrapolate
that information and aggregate it,

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.600
such that they can
pretty much form a recipe

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:08.304
for the air at different times.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.344
Then I come in as the artist
and take that recipe

00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:14.484
and recreate it using the component gases.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:19.746
I was particularly interested
in moments of time

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.812
that are examples
of life changing the air,

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:27.332
but also the air that can influence
how life will evolve,

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.770
like Carboniferous air.

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:34.979
It's from about 300 to 350
million years ago.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.514
It's an era known
as the time of the giants.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.785
So for the first time
in the history of life,

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.208
lignin evolves.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:45.556
That's the hard stuff
that trees are made of.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.110
So trees effectively invent
their own trunks at this time,

00:04:49.134 --> 00:04:51.180
and they get really big,
bigger and bigger,

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:52.559
and pepper the Earth,

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.876
releasing oxygen, releasing
oxygen, releasing oxygen,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.514
such that the oxygen levels
are about twice as high

00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:00.935
as what they are today.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.464
And this rich air supports
massive insects --

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:11.012
huge spiders and dragonflies
with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:16.284
To breathe, this air is really clean
and really fresh.

00:05:16.308 --> 00:05:17.979
It doesn't so much have a flavor,

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:22.475
but it does give your body
a really subtle kind of boost of energy.

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.366
It's really good for hangovers.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.595
(Laughter)

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:29.293
Or there's the air of the Great Dying --

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:32.941
that's about 252.5 million years ago,

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.007
just before the dinosaurs evolve.

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:38.763
It's a really short time period,
geologically speaking,

00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:41.746
from about 20- to 200,000 years.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.064
Really quick.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:46.867
This is the greatest extinction event
in Earth's history,

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.455
even bigger than when
the dinosaurs died out.

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:54.172
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species
at this time die out,

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:59.373
and simultaneous to that is a huge,
dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:00.990
that a lot of scientists agree

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:04.151
comes from a simultaneous
eruption of volcanoes

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.105
and a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:12.585
Oxygen levels at this time go
to below half of what they are today,

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:13.904
so about 10 percent.

00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:16.809
So this air would definitely not
support human life,

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.855
but it's OK to just have a breath.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.915
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.862
It's really calming, it's quite warm

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:29.034
and it has a flavor a little bit
like soda water.

00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:31.563
It has that kind of spritz,
quite pleasant.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.353
So with all this thinking
about air of the past,

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:39.008
it's quite natural to start thinking
about the air of the future.

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:42.936
And instead of being speculative with air

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.474
and just making up what I think
might be the future air,

00:06:46.498 --> 00:06:49.907
I discovered this human-synthesized air.

00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:53.718
That means that it doesn't occur
anywhere in nature,

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:56.859
but it's made by humans in a laboratory

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.232
for application in different
industrial settings.

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:02.968
Why is it future air?

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.039
Well, this air is a really stable molecule

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:11.520
that will literally be part of the air
once it's released,

00:07:11.544 --> 00:07:15.621
for the next 300 to 400 years,
before it's broken down.

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:20.059
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:24.644
And this future air has
some very sensual qualities.

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.201
It's very heavy.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.683
It's about eight times heavier
than the air we're used to breathing.

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:36.462
It's so heavy, in fact,
that when you breathe it in,

00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:39.883
whatever words you speak
are kind of literally heavy as well,

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:43.113
so they dribble down your chin
and drop to the floor

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:44.786
and soak into the cracks.

00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:48.325
It's an air that operates
quite a lot like a liquid.

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:53.392
Now, this air comes
with an ethical dimension as well.

00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:55.999
Humans made this air,

00:07:56.023 --> 00:08:00.279
but it's also the most potent
greenhouse gas

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:02.049
that has ever been tested.

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:08.777
Its warming potential is 24,000 times
that of carbon dioxide,

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:12.346
and it has that longevity
of 12 to 16 generations.

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:18.097
So this ethical confrontation
is really central to my work.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.459
(In a lowered voice) It has
another quite surprising quality.

00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:38.896
It changes the sound of your voice
quite dramatically.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.008
(Laughter)

00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:48.137
So when we start to think -- ooh!
It's still there a bit.

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:49.595
(Laughter)

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:52.209
When we think about climate change,

00:08:52.233 --> 00:08:58.202
we probably don't think about
giant insects and erupting volcanoes

00:08:58.226 --> 00:08:59.972
or funny voices.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.716
The images that more readily come to mind

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.770
are things like retreating glaciers
and polar bears adrift on icebergs.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:12.339
We think about pie charts
and column graphs

00:09:12.363 --> 00:09:16.319
and endless politicians
talking to scientists wearing cardigans.

00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:22.274
But perhaps it's time we start
thinking about climate change

00:09:22.298 --> 00:09:26.141
on the same visceral level
that we experience the air.

00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:33.178
Like air, climate change is simultaneously
at the scale of the molecule,

00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:35.607
the breath and the planet.

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:40.618
It's immediate, vital and intimate,

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:44.995
as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.

00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:49.740
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:55.624
Climate change is the collective
self-portrait of humanity.

00:09:55.648 --> 00:09:58.211
It reflects our decisions as individuals,

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:00.459
as governments and as industries.

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.828
And if there's anything
I've learned from looking at air,

00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:08.111
it's that even though
it's changing, it persists.

00:10:08.785 --> 00:10:12.375
It may not support the kind of life
that we'd recognize,

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.496
but it will support something.

00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:18.613
And if we humans are such a vital
part of that change,

00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:22.376
I think it's important
that we can feel the discussion.

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:26.519
Because even though it's invisible,

00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:31.977
humans are leaving
a very vibrant trace in the air.

00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:34.207
Thank you.

00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:36.157
(Applause)
