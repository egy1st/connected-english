00:00:01.012 --> 00:00:05.229
Cybercrime is out of control.

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:07.551
It's everywhere.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.863
We hear about it every single day.

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:13.985
This year,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.143
over two billion records lost or stolen.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.685
And last year, 100 million of us,
mostly Americans,

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:30.843
lost our health insurance data
to thieves -- myself included.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:37.751
What's particularly concerning about this
is that in most cases,

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:43.686
it was months before anyone even
reported that these records were stolen.

00:00:45.164 --> 00:00:48.207
So if you watch the evening news,

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:53.437
you would think that most of this
is espionage or nation-state activity.

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:56.086
And, well, some of it is.

00:00:56.694 --> 00:01:01.132
Espionage, you see, is an accepted
international practice.

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:03.276
But in this case,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.753
it is only a small portion
of the problem that we're dealing with.

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.974
How often do we hear about a breach

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:17.849
followed by, "... it was the result
of a sophisticated nation-state attack?"

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:23.522
Well, often that is companies
not being willing to own up

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:26.526
to their own lackluster
security practices.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:29.565
There is also a widely held belief

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:34.206
that by blaming an attack
on a nation-state,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.911
you are putting regulators at bay --

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:38.969
at least for a period of time.

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:44.320
So where is all of this coming from?

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:50.490
The United Nations estimates
that 80 percent of it

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:56.284
is from highly organized
and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:58.973
To date,

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:05.597
this represents one of the largest
illegal economies in the world,

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.741
topping out at, now get this,

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:13.081
445 billion dollars.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.451
Let me put that in perspective
for all of you:

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:22.579
445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:25.269
of 160 nations,

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:29.838
including Ireland, Finland,
Denmark and Portugal,

00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:31.092
to name a few.

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:34.297
So how does this work?

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.227
How do these criminals operate?

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.557
Well, let me tell you a little story.

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:41.725
About a year ago,

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.059
our security researchers were tracking

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:51.129
a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated
banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:54.146
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
via you clicking on a link
in a phishing email

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:59.146
that you probably shouldn't have.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.167
It would then sit and wait.

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.766
It would wait until you logged
into your bank account.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.642
And when you did,
the bad guys would reach in,

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.319
steal your credentials,

00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:12.244
and then use that to steal your money.

00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:14.943
This sounds terrible,

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:17.760
but the reality is,
in the security industry,

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:21.466
this form of attack
is somewhat commonplace.

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:30.166
However, the Dyre Wolf had
two distinctly different personalities --

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.000
one for these small transactions,

00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:36.064
but it took on an entirely
different persona

00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:39.903
if you were in the business of moving
large-scale wire transfers.

00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:41.626
Here's what would happen.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.450
You start the process
of issuing a wire transfer,

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.482
and up in your browser would pop
a screen from your bank,

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:50.103
indicating that there's a problem
with your account,

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:53.318
and that you need to call
the bank immediately,

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.084
along with the number
to the bank's fraud department.

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.005
So you pick up the phone and you call.

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.040
And after going through
the normal voice prompts,

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:04.181
you're met with
an English-speaking operator.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:07.073
"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.
How can I help you?"

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:11.686
And you go through the process
like you do every time you call your bank,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.501
of giving them your name
and your account number,

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:18.448
going through the security checks
to verify you are who you said you are.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.297
Most of us may not know this,

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:23.550
but in many large-scale wire transfers,

00:04:23.574 --> 00:04:26.685
it requires two people to sign off
on the wire transfer,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:29.908
so the operator then asks you
to get the second person on the line,

00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:32.733
and goes through the same set
of verifications and checks.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.306
Sounds normal, right?

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.351
Only one problem:

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.200
you're not talking to the bank.

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.810
You're talking to the criminals.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:43.032
They had built
an English-speaking help desk,

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:45.121
fake overlays to the banking website.

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.245
And this was so flawlessly executed

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:50.412
that they were moving
between a half a million

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:53.523
and a million and a half
dollars per attempt

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.105
into their criminal coffers.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.755
These criminal organizations operate

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.804
like highly regimented,
legitimate businesses.

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.828
Their employees work
Monday through Friday.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.845
They take the weekends off.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.252
How do we know this?

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:11.409
We know this because
our security researchers see

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:14.499
repeated spikes of malware
on a Friday afternoon.

00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:18.469
The bad guys, after a long weekend
with the wife and kids,

00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:20.733
come back in to see how well things went.

00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.375
The Dark Web is where
they spend their time.

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:33.084
That is a term used to describe
the anonymous underbelly of the internet,

00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:36.033
where thieves can operate with anonymity

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:37.502
and without detection.

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.236
Here they peddle their attack software

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.716
and share information
on new attack techniques.

00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:47.421
You can buy everything there,

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:51.101
from a base-level attack
to a much more advanced version.

00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:54.134
In fact, in many cases, you even see

00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:57.330
gold, silver and bronze levels of service.

00:05:57.903 --> 00:05:59.574
You can check references.

00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:02.537
You can even buy attacks

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.889
that come with a money-back guarantee --

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:06.958
(Laughter)

00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:08.637
if you're not successful.

00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.022
Now, these environments,
these marketplaces --

00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:16.393
they look like an Amazon or an eBay.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:20.373
You see products, prices,
ratings and reviews.

00:06:20.397 --> 00:06:22.651
Of course, if you're going
to buy an attack,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:26.124
you're going to buy from a reputable
criminal with good ratings, right?

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.152
(Laughter)

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:28.377
This isn't any different

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:33.591
than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor
before going to a new restaurant.

00:06:34.503 --> 00:06:36.596
So, here is an example.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.041
This is an actual screenshot
of a vendor selling malware.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:43.880
Notice they're a vendor level four,

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.745
they have a trust level of six.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:48.104
They've had 400 positive reviews
in the last year,

00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:50.508
and only two negative reviews
in the last month.

00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:54.429
We even see things like licensing terms.

00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:56.766
Here's an example of a site you can go to

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.547
if you want to change your identity.

00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.428
They will sell you a fake ID,

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:02.046
fake passports.

00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:07.652
But note the legally binding terms
for purchasing your fake ID.

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:10.039
Give me a break.

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:12.921
What are they going to do --
sue you if you violate them?

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:14.095
(Laughter)

00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:17.881
This occurred a couple of months ago.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:21.520
One of our security
researchers was looking

00:07:21.544 --> 00:07:26.542
at a new Android malware application
that we had discovered.

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:28.486
It was called Bilal Bot.

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:31.440
In a blog post,

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:38.269
she positioned Bilal Bot
as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.208
to the much more advanced GM Bot

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:45.047
that was commonplace
in the criminal underground.

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:50.668
This review did not sit well
with the authors of Bilal Bot.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.817
So they wrote her this very email,

00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.785
pleading their case
and making the argument

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:03.238
that they felt she had evaluated
an older version.

00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:08.907
They asked her to please update
her blog with more accurate information

00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:12.343
and even offered to do an interview

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.588
to describe to her in detail

00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:19.211
how their attack software was now
far better than the competition.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:21.690
So look,

00:08:21.714 --> 00:08:25.578
you don't have to like what they do,

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:30.521
but you do have to respect
the entrepreneurial nature

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:31.752
of their endeavors.

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:32.926
(Laughter)

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:38.331
So how are we going to stop this?

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:45.278
It's not like we're going to be able
to identify who's responsible --

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:48.264
remember, they operate with anonymity

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:50.273
and outside the reach of the law.

00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:54.501
We're certainly not going to be able
to prosecute the offenders.

00:08:55.156 --> 00:09:00.701
I would propose that we need
a completely new approach.

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:05.669
And that approach needs
to be centered on the idea

00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:09.588
that we need to change
the economics for the bad guys.

00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:13.346
And to give you a perspective
on how this can work,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.358
let's think of the response we see
to a healthcare pandemic:

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:21.385
SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:23.957
What is the top priority?

00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:29.274
It's knowing who is infected
and how the disease is spreading.

00:09:32.015 --> 00:09:38.162
Now, governments, private institutions,
hospitals, physicians --

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.781
everyone responds openly and quickly.

00:09:43.334 --> 00:09:47.305
This is a collective and altruistic effort

00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:51.229
to stop the spread in its tracks

00:09:51.253 --> 00:09:54.130
and to inform anyone not infected

00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:56.534
how to protect or inoculate themselves.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.594
Unfortunately, this is not at all
what we see in response to a cyber attack.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.301
Organizations are far more likely
to keep information on that attack

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:11.950
to themselves.

00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:14.238
Why?

00:10:14.262 --> 00:10:17.232
Because they're worried
about competitive advantage,

00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:19.614
litigation

00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:20.944
or regulation.

00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:27.597
We need to effectively democratize
threat intelligence data.

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:33.451
We need to get all of these organizations
to open up and share

00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:37.097
what is in their private arsenal
of information.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.804
The bad guys are moving fast;

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:43.945
we've got to move faster.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.472
And the best way to do that is to open up

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:50.843
and share data on what's happening.

00:10:51.304 --> 00:10:55.630
Let's think about this in the construct
of security professionals.

00:10:56.164 --> 00:11:01.140
Remember, they're programmed right
into their DNA to keep secrets.

00:11:01.164 --> 00:11:04.188
We've got to turn
that thinking on its head.

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:07.493
We've got to get governments,
private institutions

00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:08.960
and security companies

00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:11.715
willing to share information at speed.

00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:13.415
And here's why:

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.316
because if you share the information,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.357
it's equivalent to inoculation.

00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:20.210
And if you're not sharing,

00:11:20.234 --> 00:11:22.335
you're actually part of the problem,

00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:28.127
because you're increasing the odds
that other people could be impacted

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:30.781
by the same attack techniques.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:34.035
But there's an even bigger benefit.

00:11:35.198 --> 00:11:39.944
By destroying criminals' devices
closer to real time,

00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:41.721
we break their plans.

00:11:43.462 --> 00:11:46.702
We inform the people they aim to hurt

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.371
far sooner than they had ever anticipated.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.721
We ruin their reputations,

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:55.837
we crush their ratings and reviews.

00:11:56.305 --> 00:12:00.137
We make cybercrime not pay.

00:12:00.931 --> 00:12:04.699
We change the economics for the bad guys.

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:10.287
But to do this,
a first mover was required --

00:12:10.311 --> 00:12:14.912
someone to change the thinking
in the security industry overall.

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:17.337
About a year ago,

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:19.867
my colleagues and I had a radical idea.

00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:25.208
What if IBM were to take our data --

00:12:25.987 --> 00:12:29.975
we had one of the largest threat
intelligence databases in the world --

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.358
and open it up?

00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:35.218
It had information not just
on what had happened in the past,

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:37.717
but what was happening in near-real time.

00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:41.638
What if we were to publish it all
openly on the internet?

00:12:42.463 --> 00:12:44.957
As you can imagine,
this got quite a reaction.

00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.345
First came the lawyers:

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:48.684
What are the legal
implications of doing that?

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:50.720
Then came the business:

00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:53.144
What are the business
implications of doing that?

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:55.795
And this was also met with a good dose

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:58.927
of a lot of people just asking
if we were completely crazy.

00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:03.714
But there was one conversation
that kept floating to the surface

00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:05.789
in every dialogue that we would have:

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.947
the realization that if we didn't do this,

00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:12.602
then we were part of the problem.

00:13:13.514 --> 00:13:16.374
So we did something unheard of
in the security industry.

00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:18.718
We started publishing.

00:13:18.742 --> 00:13:23.152
Over 700 terabytes of actionable
threat intelligence data,

00:13:23.176 --> 00:13:26.181
including information on real-time attacks

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:29.068
that can be used to stop
cybercrime in its tracks.

00:13:29.813 --> 00:13:31.183
And to date,

00:13:31.207 --> 00:13:35.251
over 4,000 organizations
are leveraging this data,

00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:37.154
including half of the Fortune 100.

00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:42.616
And our hope as a next step
is to get all of those organizations

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.601
to join us in the fight,

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:46.176
and do the same thing

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.288
and share their information

00:13:48.312 --> 00:13:50.846
on when and how
they're being attacked as well.

00:13:51.552 --> 00:13:54.570
We all have the opportunity to stop it,

00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:56.755
and we already all know how.

00:13:57.372 --> 00:14:01.742
All we have to do is look
to the response that we see

00:14:01.766 --> 00:14:03.272
in the world of health care,

00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:05.199
and how they respond to a pandemic.

00:14:05.623 --> 00:14:07.002
Simply put,

00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:09.302
we need to be open and collaborative.

00:14:09.876 --> 00:14:11.027
Thank you.

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:14.843
(Applause)
