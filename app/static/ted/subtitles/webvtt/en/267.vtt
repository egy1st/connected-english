00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few words about how I got started,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and very much to myself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And, kind of as a way of surviving,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I would go into my own very personal space,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I would make things.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I would make things for people

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I would go into these private places,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is very much connected with not only the idea realm,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but also with very much the feeling realm.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the ideas are very disparate.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and there's no real connection between one or the other,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
except that they sort of come out of my brain,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When I was a child, I started to explore motion.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I fell in love with the way things moved,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I remember when I was doing this,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I was thinking about that little rock there,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and how the characters --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
would come shooting out of the car,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, it has to end with this --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Laughter) --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
gratuitous violence.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
(Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and expressed it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now, when I went to college,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And this really came about

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
from having many different kinds of interests.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and becoming a surgeon,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because it meant working with my hands

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in a very focused, intense way.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So, I started taking art courses,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and I found a way to make sculpture

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
at the same time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And it's full of many little trivial end points,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and it doesn't really mean anything.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The connection I have with engineering

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I love to figure things out,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Laughter)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's pretty ambiguous.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Laughter)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The next piece that is going to come up

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I gave myself the problem.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Since I'm always liking to solve problems,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and solving all of the mechanical problems

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
for getting this little man to walk back and forth.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but I did have a sense of the gesture,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And then it was a matter of starting from one point

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and sort of building to that final point.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And that's a little found object.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So a lot of the pieces that I've made,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
they involve found objects.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I imagine what can be said with them.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You know, they say, never play with your food --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but I always play with things.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And I started to make him walk across the table,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And that's the whole piece.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's about that big.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Applause)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and it is able to achieve the action that I want.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and I saw it explode up and out.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
so the way I saw this in my mind at first,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and the pieces would move far out,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and then they would begin to be pulled back

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
with a kind of a gravitational feel,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And they would coalesce for just a moment,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
so you could perceive that there was a chair there.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and I wanted to express that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
because obviously you can't move physical matter

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
This whole thing is about four feet wide,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and the chair itself is only about a few inches.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
(Applause)

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So, we have a motor here on the left,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and it goes through a gear train.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Because it could run all the time.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
(Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Now, a completely different thought.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm always imagining myself in different situations.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I'm imagining myself as a machine.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
What would I love?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I would love to be bathed in oil.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
(Laughter)

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Laughter)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Applause)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And it's really, just sort of --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And then, I got a call from a friend

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
who wanted to have a show of erotic art,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and I didn't have any pieces.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And this one I call "Machine with Grease."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Laughter) --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Laughter)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It's definitely happy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
From an engineering point of view,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
this is just a little four-bar linkage.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and how simply could I state something.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
For me, the process is very important,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because I'm inventing machines,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So this is a little wire-bending tool.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I made that tool, and then I made this other tool

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
for sort of centering gears very quickly --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
sort of developing my own little world of technology.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And that was that tool.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It completely changed what I could do.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I just like, throw it in.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So, that's a finished gear.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
When I moved to Boston,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
(Laughter)

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
pieces of sculpture on the street,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Laughter)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and I'm going to have it --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So, that's what it does.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
(Laughter)

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But then in the end, what I decided

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
was every time you finish writing the word,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But I had a lot of fun.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
(Applause)

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the most complete kind of piece.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And when I had this thought,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I was imagining that I would make --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I would have a whole machine theater evening,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
where I would -- you would have an audience,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...


00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:24.000
where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
start off in my own mind, in my heart,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and it always feels really crude.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
It's always a struggle,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
out into an object, and then it's there, OK.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It means nothing at all.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The object itself just means nothing.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
then there's a cycle that has been completed.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And to me, that's the most important thing

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So I'll just let this chair come down.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Applause)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Thank you.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Applause)
