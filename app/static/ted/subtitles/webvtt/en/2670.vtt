WEBVTT

00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.120
I'm a relationship builder.

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:05.116
When you think of a relationship builder,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.440
don't you just automatically
think "architect?"

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.345
Probably not.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:14.283
That's because most people think
architects design buildings and cities,

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:16.661
but what we really design
are relationships,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.490
because cities are about people.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:22.896
They're places where people come together
for all kinds of exchange.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.137
And besides, skylines
are highly specific urban habitats

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.479
with their own insects,
plants and animals,

00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:30.136
and even their own weather.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.394
But today, urban habitats
are out of balance.

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:37.835
Climate change, together with political
and economic troubles,

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.011
are having an impact;

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:42.347
they're adding up
and stressing out cities and us,

00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.902
the people who live in them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.625
For me, the field of ecology
has provided important insight,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.858
because ecologists don't just look
at individual species on their own,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.075
they look at the relationships
between living things

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:57.348
and their environment.

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:02.432
They look at how all the diverse parts
of the ecosystem are interconnected,

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:06.754
and it's actually this balance,
this web of life, that sustains life.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:11.860
My team and I have been applying
insights from ecology to architecture

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.878
to see how physical space
can help build stronger relationships.

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:18.266
The projects I'm going to show you today

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.993
use the idea of building relationships
as the key driver for design.

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:24.685
Here's an example of what I mean.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.858
Recently, we were asked to design
a center for social justice leadership

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.432
called the Arcus Center.

00:01:31.102 --> 00:01:34.624
They asked us for a building
that could break down traditional barriers

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:35.932
between different groups

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:40.203
and in doing so, create possibilities
for meaningful conversations

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:41.731
around social justice.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.890
The students wanted a place
for cultural exchange.

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:48.713
They thought a place for preparing
food together could do that.

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.468
And they wanted to be welcoming
to the outside community.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.155
They thought a fireplace
could draw people in

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.475
and help start conversations.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:01.018
And everybody wanted the work
of social justice to be visible

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:02.461
to the outside world.

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:06.309
There really wasn't a precedent
for this kind of space,

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.800
so we looked around the globe
and found examples

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.569
of community meeting houses.

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:13.164
Community meeting houses are places

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:16.549
where there's very specific
relationships between people,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.745
like this one in Mali,
where the elders gather.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.741
The low roof keeps everybody seated
and at equal eye level.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:24.988
It's very egalitarian.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.490
I mean, you can't stand up
and take over the meeting.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.027
You'd actually bump your head.

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:30.704
(Laughter)

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:33.342
In meeting houses,
there's always a central space

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.017
where you can sit around a circle
and see each other.

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.062
So we designed a space just like that

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.065
right in the middle of the Arcus Center,

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.079
and we anchored it
with a fireplace and a kitchen.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.575
It's pretty hard to get a kitchen
and a fireplace in a building like this

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.803
with the building codes,

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:50.629
but it was so important
to the concept, we got it done.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:55.069
And now the central space
works for big social gatherings

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:58.331
and a place to meet one-on-one
for the very first time.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.434
It's almost like
this three-way intersection

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:04.032
that encourages bumping into people
and starting a conversation.

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:07.820
Now you can always pass the kitchen
and see something going on.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:11.191
You can sit by the fireplace
and share stories.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.951
You can study together
in big groups or in small ones,

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.212
because the architecture
sets up these opportunities.

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:22.244
Even the construction
is about building relationships.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.129
It's made of cordwood masonry,

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:27.090
which is using logs
the way you would use bricks.

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:30.085
It's super low-tech and easy to do
and anyone can do it --

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.786
and that's the entire point.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.777
The act of making is a social activity.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.420
And it's good for the planet, too:

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:41.540
the trees absorbed carbon
when they were growing up,

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.208
and they gave off oxygen,

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:45.973
and now that carbon
is trapped inside the walls

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:49.170
and it's not being released
into the atmosphere.

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:53.265
So making the walls is equivalent
to taking cars right off the road.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.418
We chose the building method

00:03:56.442 --> 00:04:00.388
because it connects people
to each other and to the environment.

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:02.586
But is it working?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.876
Is it creating relationships
and nurturing them?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.218
How can we know?

00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:09.653
Well, more and more people
are coming here, for one,

00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:11.997
and as a result of the fireside chats

00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:14.119
and a full calendar of programming,

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.731
people are applying
for the Arcus Fellowships.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:21.054
In fact, applications have increased
tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.343
since the building opened.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.037
It's working. It's bringing
people together.

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:28.622
So I've shown how architecture
can connect people

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:30.804
on this kind of horizontal campus scale.

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.843
But we wondered if social relationships
could be scaled up --

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.520
or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.

00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.418
Tall buildings don't necessarily lend
themselves to being social buildings.

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:44.435
They can seem isolating and inward.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:49.358
You might only see people
in those awkward elevator rides.

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:54.187
But in several major cities,
I've been designing tall buildings

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:57.552
that are based on creating
relationships between people.

00:04:57.576 --> 00:04:59.052
This is Aqua.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:02.650
It's a residential high-rise in Chicago

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:05.285
aimed at young urban professionals
and empty nesters,

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.952
many of them new to the city.

00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:11.743
With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see
if we could use architecture

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:13.838
to help people get to know
their neighbors,

00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:17.112
even when their homes are organized
in the vertical dimension.

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:22.804
So we invented a way to use balconies
as the new social connectors.

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.109
The shapes of the floor slabs
vary slightly and they transition

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.502
as you go up the tower.

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:32.427
The result of this
is that you can actually see people

00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:33.796
from your balcony.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.953
The balconies are misregistered.

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:38.121
You can lean over your balcony
and say, "Hey!"

00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:40.346
just like you would across the backyard.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:43.026
To make the balconies more comfortable

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.327
for a longer period of time
during the year,

00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:47.817
we studied the wind
with digital simulations,

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:50.703
so the effect of the balcony shapes
breaks up the wind

00:05:50.727 --> 00:05:52.038
and confuses the wind

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:55.119
and makes the balconies
more comfortable and less windy.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.059
Now, just by being able
to go outside on your balcony

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:01.158
or on the third floor roof terrace,

00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:03.267
you can be connected to the outdoors,

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.422
even when you're way above
the ground plane.

00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:08.181
So the building acts to create community

00:06:08.205 --> 00:06:10.826
within the building and the city
at the same time.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.016
It's working.

00:06:12.863 --> 00:06:16.863
And people are starting to meet each other
on the building surface

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.043
and we've heard --

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:19.123
(Laughter)

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:21.915
they've even starting getting
together as couples.

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:25.383
But besides romantic relationships,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:27.647
the building has a positive social effect

00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:29.608
on the community,

00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:32.319
as evidenced by people
starting groups together

00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:34.189
and starting big projects together,

00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:38.189
like this organic community garden
on the building's roof terrace.

00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:42.890
So I've shown how tall buildings
can be social connectors,

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:44.906
but what about public architecture?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.793
How can we create better
social cohesion in public buildings

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:50.174
and civic spaces,

00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:51.631
and why is it important?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.167
Public architecture
is just not as successful

00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:56.115
if it comes from the top down.

00:06:57.493 --> 00:06:59.591
About 15 years ago in Chicago,

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.722
they started to replace
old police stations,

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:05.916
and they built this identical model
all over the city.

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.060
And even though they had good intentions

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:11.582
of treating all neighborhoods equally,

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:14.026
the communities didn't feel
invested in the process

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.564
or feel a sense of ownership
of these buildings.

00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:20.115
It was equality in the sense that
everybody gets the same police station,

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.493
but it wasn't equity
in the sense of responding

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:25.875
to each community's individual needs.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:28.740
And equity is the key issue here.

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:32.164
You know, in my field, there's a debate

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:34.779
about whether architecture
can even do anything

00:07:34.803 --> 00:07:36.988
to improve social relationships.

00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:42.446
But I believe that we need architecture
and every tool in our tool kit

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.408
to improve these relationships.

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:48.696
In the US, policy reforms
have been recommended

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.524
in order to rebuild trust.

00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:51.956
But my team and I wondered

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.019
if design and a more inclusive
design process

00:07:55.043 --> 00:07:58.696
could help add something positive
to this policy conversation.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.406
We asked ourselves simply:

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.386
Can design help rebuild trust?

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:07.430
So we reached out to community members
and police officers in North Lawndale;

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.013
it's a neighborhood in Chicago

00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:11.853
where the police station
is perceived as a scary fortress

00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:13.566
surrounded by a parking lot.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:16.872
In North Lawndale,
people are afraid of police

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.101
and of going anywhere
near the police station,

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.412
even to report a crime.

00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:23.596
So we organized this brainstorming session

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.278
with both groups participating,

00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:28.482
and we came up with this whole
new idea for the police station.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.046
It's called "Polis Station."

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.790
"Polis" is a Greek word that means
a place with a sense of community.

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:38.148
It's based on the idea

00:08:38.172 --> 00:08:42.109
that if you can increase opportunities
for positive social interactions

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.426
between police and community members,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.645
you can rebuild that relationship

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.383
and activate the neighborhood
at the same time.

00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:53.288
Instead of the police station
as a scary fortress,

00:08:53.312 --> 00:08:57.769
you get highly active spaces
on the public side of the station --

00:08:57.793 --> 00:08:59.303
places that spark conversation,

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:01.887
like a barbershop, a coffee shop

00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:03.484
or sports courts as well.

00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:05.687
Both cops and kids said they love sports.

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:09.730
These insights came directly
from the community members

00:09:09.754 --> 00:09:12.086
and the police officers themselves,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.869
and as designers, our role
was just to connect the dots

00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:17.515
and suggest the first step.

00:09:17.853 --> 00:09:20.467
So with the help
of the city and the parks,

00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:24.777
we were able to raise funds
and design and build a half-court,

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:27.141
right on the police station parking lot.

00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:28.606
It's a start.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.498
But is it rebuilding trust?

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:34.430
The people in North Lawndale say
the kids are using the courts every day

00:09:34.454 --> 00:09:37.803
and they even organize tournaments
like this one shown here,

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.441
and once in a while an officer joins in.

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:44.930
But now, they even have basketballs
inside the station

00:09:44.954 --> 00:09:46.219
that kids can borrow.

00:09:46.243 --> 00:09:48.735
And recently they've asked us
to expand the courts

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:50.702
and build a park on the site.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:55.007
And parents report something astonishing.

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:59.722
Before, there was fear of going
anywhere the station, and now they say

00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:03.233
there's a sense that the court is safer
than other courts nearby,

00:10:03.257 --> 00:10:05.531
and they prefer their kids to play here.

00:10:06.277 --> 00:10:07.867
So maybe in the future,

00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:09.537
on the public side of the station,

00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:13.266
you might be able to drop in
for a haircut at the barbershop

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.939
or reserve the community room
for a birthday party

00:10:15.963 --> 00:10:17.606
or renew your driver's license

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.728
or get money out of an ATM.

00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:22.895
It can be a place for neighbors
to meet each other

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:25.606
and to get to know
the officers, and vice versa.

00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:28.725
This is not a utopian fantasy.

00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:32.737
It's about how do you design
to rebuild trust,

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.248
trusting relationships?

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.800
You know, every city has parks,
libraries, schools

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:40.218
and other public buildings

00:10:40.242 --> 00:10:44.428
that have the potential
to be reimagined as social connectors.

00:10:45.134 --> 00:10:49.164
But reimagining the buildings
for the future is going to require

00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:51.296
engaging the people who live there.

00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:55.867
Engaging the public can be intimidating,
and I've felt that, too.

00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:58.172
But maybe that's because
in architecture school,

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:02.203
we don't really learn how to engage
the public in the act of design.

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:05.337
We're taught to defend
our design against criticism.

00:11:05.774 --> 00:11:07.842
But I think that can change, too.

00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:11.566
So if we can focus the design mind

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.570
on creating positive,
reinforcing relationships

00:11:15.594 --> 00:11:17.574
in architecture and through architecture,

00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:21.464
I believe we can do much more
than create individual buildings.

00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:25.440
We can reduce the stress
and the polarization

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:27.028
in our urban habitats.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.145
We can create relationships.

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.968
We can help steady
this planet we all share.

00:11:34.142 --> 00:11:35.301
See?

00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:37.564
Architects really are
relationship builders.

00:11:37.588 --> 00:11:38.950
(Laughter)

00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:40.126
Thank you very much.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.195
(Applause)
