00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:03.024
How many of you are creatives,

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:06.672
designers, engineers,
entrepreneurs, artists,

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:09.083
or maybe you just have
a really big imagination?

00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:10.955
Show of hands? (Cheers)

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.160
That's most of you.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:15.628
I have some news for us creatives.

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.287
Over the course of the next 20 years,

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.444
more will change around
the way we do our work

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:27.539
than has happened in the last 2,000.

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.139
In fact, I think we're at the dawn
of a new age in human history.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:38.406
Now, there have been four major historical
eras defined by the way we work.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:42.679
The Hunter-Gatherer Age
lasted several million years.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:46.739
And then the Agricultural Age
lasted several thousand years.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:50.685
The Industrial Age lasted
a couple of centuries.

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:54.996
And now the Information Age
has lasted just a few decades.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.240
And now today, we're on the cusp
of our next great era as a species.

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.976
Welcome to the Augmented Age.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.693
In this new era, your natural human
capabilities are going to be augmented

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:10.785
by computational systems
that help you think,

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:12.995
robotic systems that help you make,

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:14.667
and a digital nervous system

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:18.381
that connects you to the world
far beyond your natural senses.

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:21.379
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:23.603
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.783
(Laughter)

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:29.628
I would actually argue
that we're already augmented.

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:31.792
Imagine you're at a party,

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:35.336
and somebody asks you a question
that you don't know the answer to.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
If you have one of these,
in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.168
But this is just a primitive beginning.

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:46.194
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.041
In fact, for the last
three-and-a-half million years,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.174
the tools that we've had
have been completely passive.

00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:57.858
They do exactly what we tell them
and nothing more.

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.983
Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.862
The chisel only carves
where the artist points it.

00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:10.984
And even our most advanced tools
do nothing without our explicit direction.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.189
In fact, to date, and this
is something that frustrates me,

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:15.661
we've always been limited

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:19.186
by this need to manually
push our wills into our tools --

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.507
like, manual,
literally using our hands,

00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:22.959
even with computers.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:26.535
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.409
(Laughter)

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.579
I want to have a conversation
with a computer.

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.573
I want to say, "Computer,
let's design a car,"

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:35.136
and the computer shows me a car.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.768
And I say, "No, more fast-looking,
and less German,"

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:39.955
and bang, the computer shows me an option.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.844
(Laughter)

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.514
That conversation might be
a little ways off,

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.203
probably less than many of us think,

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.990
but right now,

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:50.165
we're working on it.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.222
Tools are making this leap
from being passive to being generative.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.139
Generative design tools
use a computer and algorithms

00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:00.771
to synthesize geometry

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:03.549
to come up with new designs
all by themselves.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.744
All it needs are your goals
and your constraints.

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:08.176
I'll give you an example.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.988
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:13.638
all you would need to do
is tell it something like,

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:14.935
it has four propellers,

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.090
you want it to be
as lightweight as possible,

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.384
and you need it to be
aerodynamically efficient.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:24.322
Then what the computer does
is it explores the entire solution space:

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:28.273
every single possibility that solves
and meets your criteria --

00:03:28.297 --> 00:03:29.739
millions of them.

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.738
It takes big computers to do this.

00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:33.717
But it comes back to us with designs

00:03:33.741 --> 00:03:36.884
that we, by ourselves,
never could've imagined.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:40.238
And the computer's coming up
with this stuff all by itself --

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.940
no one ever drew anything,

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:44.050
and it started completely from scratch.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.425
And by the way, it's no accident

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.930
that the drone body looks just like
the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:53.294
(Laughter)

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.342
It's because the algorithms
are designed to work

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.003
the same way evolution does.

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:01.375
What's exciting is we're starting
to see this technology

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:02.558
out in the real world.

00:04:02.582 --> 00:04:05.034
We've been working with Airbus
for a couple of years

00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:06.967
on this concept plane for the future.

00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.061
It's a ways out still.

00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:12.865
But just recently we used
a generative-design AI

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.696
to come up with this.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.762
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
that's been designed by a computer.

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:23.610
It's stronger than the original
yet half the weight,

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:26.780
and it will be flying
in the Airbus A320 later this year.

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:28.964
So computers can now generate;

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:33.583
they can come up with their own solutions
to our well-defined problems.

00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:35.987
But they're not intuitive.

00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.097
They still have to start from scratch
every single time,

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.686
and that's because they never learn.

00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:44.134
Unlike Maggie.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:45.739
(Laughter)

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.060
Maggie's actually smarter
than our most advanced design tools.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:50.907
What do I mean by that?

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:52.521
If her owner picks up that leash,

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:54.613
Maggie knows with a fair
degree of certainty

00:04:54.637 --> 00:04:56.041
it's time to go for a walk.

00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:57.250
And how did she learn?

00:04:57.274 --> 00:05:00.598
Well, every time the owner picked up
the leash, they went for a walk.

00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:02.500
And Maggie did three things:

00:05:02.524 --> 00:05:04.393
she had to pay attention,

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.499
she had to remember what happened

00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:10.540
and she had to retain and create
a pattern in her mind.

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.524
Interestingly, that's exactly what

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:16.071
computer scientists
have been trying to get AIs to do

00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:17.954
for the last 60 or so years.

00:05:18.683 --> 00:05:20.032
Back in 1952,

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:23.857
they built this computer
that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.

00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.241
Big deal.

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.029
Then 45 years later, in 1997,

00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:32.525
Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:39.014
2011, Watson beats these two
humans at Jeopardy,

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.966
which is much harder for a computer
to play than chess is.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.802
In fact, rather than working
from predefined recipes,

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.149
Watson had to use reasoning
to overcome his human opponents.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.832
And then a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:57.118
DeepMind's AlphaGo beats
the world's best human at Go,

00:05:57.142 --> 00:05:59.354
which is the most difficult
game that we have.

00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:02.274
In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves

00:06:02.298 --> 00:06:04.322
than there are atoms in the universe.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.036
So in order to win,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.678
what AlphaGo had to do
was develop intuition.

00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:15.208
And in fact, at some points,
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:17.518
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:21.111
And things are moving really fast.

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:24.362
I mean, consider --
in the space of a human lifetime,

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:26.619
computers have gone from a child's game

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.968
to what's recognized as the pinnacle
of strategic thought.

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.416
What's basically happening

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.750
is computers are going
from being like Spock

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.723
to being a lot more like Kirk.

00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:43.365
(Laughter)

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.813
Right? From pure logic to intuition.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:49.927
Would you cross this bridge?

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:52.932
Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!"

00:06:52.956 --> 00:06:54.264
(Laughter)

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.945
And you arrived at that decision
in a split second.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.397
You just sort of knew
that bridge was unsafe.

00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.410
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:05.002
that our deep-learning systems
are starting to develop right now.

00:07:05.722 --> 00:07:07.429
Very soon, you'll literally be able

00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:09.659
to show something you've made,
you've designed,

00:07:09.683 --> 00:07:10.836
to a computer,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.349
and it will look at it and say,

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:15.196
"Sorry, homie, that'll never work.
You have to try again."

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:18.924
Or you could ask it if people
are going to like your next song,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.836
or your next flavor of ice cream.

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:26.128
Or, much more importantly,

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:28.516
you could work with a computer
to solve a problem

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.177
that we've never faced before.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.602
For instance, climate change.

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:33.646
We're not doing a very
good job on our own,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.915
we could certainly use
all the help we can get.

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.397
That's what I'm talking about,

00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:39.976
technology amplifying
our cognitive abilities

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.552
so we can imagine and design things
that were simply out of our reach

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:46.135
as plain old un-augmented humans.

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.925
So what about making
all of this crazy new stuff

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.390
that we're going to invent and design?

00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:58.045
I think the era of human augmentation
is as much about the physical world

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.134
as it is about the virtual,
intellectual realm.

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:03.754
How will technology augment us?

00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:06.734
In the physical world, robotic systems.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.356
OK, there's certainly a fear

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.868
that robots are going to take
jobs away from humans,

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.722
and that is true in certain sectors.

00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:17.052
But I'm much more interested in this idea

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:22.086
that humans and robots working together
are going to augment each other,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.168
and start to inhabit a new space.

00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:26.554
This is our applied research lab
in San Francisco,

00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:29.720
where one of our areas of focus
is advanced robotics,

00:08:29.744 --> 00:08:32.255
specifically, human-robot collaboration.

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:35.793
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.

00:08:35.817 --> 00:08:37.606
As an experiment, we set it up

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.090
to help a person working in construction
doing repetitive tasks --

00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:46.178
tasks like cutting out holes for outlets
or light switches in drywall.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:48.668
(Laughter)

00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:52.988
So, Bishop's human partner
can tell what to do in plain English

00:08:53.012 --> 00:08:54.317
and with simple gestures,

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:55.788
kind of like talking to a dog,

00:08:55.812 --> 00:08:57.955
and then Bishop executes
on those instructions

00:08:57.979 --> 00:08:59.871
with perfect precision.

00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:02.884
We're using the human
for what the human is good at:

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.241
awareness, perception and decision making.

00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:07.505
And we're using the robot
for what it's good at:

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.277
precision and repetitiveness.

00:09:10.252 --> 00:09:12.619
Here's another cool project
that Bishop worked on.

00:09:12.643 --> 00:09:15.718
The goal of this project,
which we called the HIVE,

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:19.593
was to prototype the experience
of humans, computers and robots

00:09:19.617 --> 00:09:22.837
all working together to solve
a highly complex design problem.

00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:25.244
The humans acted as labor.

00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:28.741
They cruised around the construction site,
they manipulated the bamboo --

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:31.521
which, by the way,
because it's a non-isomorphic material,

00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:33.419
is super hard for robots to deal with.

00:09:33.443 --> 00:09:35.465
But then the robots
did this fiber winding,

00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:37.940
which was almost impossible
for a human to do.

00:09:37.964 --> 00:09:41.585
And then we had an AI
that was controlling everything.

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.899
It was telling the humans what to do,
telling the robots what to do

00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:47.838
and keeping track of thousands
of individual components.

00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:49.042
What's interesting is,

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.207
building this pavilion
was simply not possible

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.755
without human, robot and AI
augmenting each other.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.210
OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:05.702
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist
Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:08.604
to generatively design
and robotically print

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:11.623
the world's first autonomously
manufactured bridge.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:16.000
So, Joris and an AI are designing
this thing right now, as we speak,

00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:17.196
in Amsterdam.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.541
And when they're done,
we're going to hit "Go,"

00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:22.876
and robots will start 3D printing
in stainless steel,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.183
and then they're going to keep printing,
without human intervention,

00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:27.765
until the bridge is finished.

00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:32.027
So, as computers are going
to augment our ability

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:34.201
to imagine and design new stuff,

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:37.120
robotic systems are going to help us
build and make things

00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:39.228
that we've never been able to make before.

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:44.507
But what about our ability
to sense and control these things?

00:10:44.531 --> 00:10:48.562
What about a nervous system
for the things that we make?

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:51.098
Our nervous system,
the human nervous system,

00:10:51.122 --> 00:10:53.433
tells us everything
that's going on around us.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.870
But the nervous system of the things
we make is rudimentary at best.

00:10:57.894 --> 00:11:01.457
For instance, a car doesn't tell
the city's public works department

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.611
that it just hit a pothole at the corner
of Broadway and Morrison.

00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:06.667
A building doesn't tell its designers

00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:09.375
whether or not the people inside
like being there,

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:12.409
and the toy manufacturer doesn't know

00:11:12.433 --> 00:11:14.440
if a toy is actually being played with --

00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:17.003
how and where and whether
or not it's any fun.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.434
Look, I'm sure that the designers
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:22.682
when they designed her.

00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.153
(Laughter)

00:11:24.177 --> 00:11:27.083
But what if it turns out that Barbie's
actually really lonely?

00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:30.254
(Laughter)

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:32.554
If the designers had known

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:34.685
what was really happening
in the real world

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:37.292
with their designs -- the road,
the building, Barbie --

00:11:37.316 --> 00:11:40.010
they could've used that knowledge
to create an experience

00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:41.434
that was better for the user.

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.249
What's missing is a nervous system

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:46.982
connecting us to all of the things
that we design, make and use.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:51.470
What if all of you had that kind
of information flowing to you

00:11:51.494 --> 00:11:53.677
from the things you create
in the real world?

00:11:55.432 --> 00:11:56.883
With all of the stuff we make,

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:59.342
we spend a tremendous amount
of money and energy --

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:01.742
in fact, last year,
about two trillion dollars --

00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:04.620
convincing people to buy
the things we've made.

00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:08.032
But if you had this connection
to the things that you design and create

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:09.783
after they're out in the real world,

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:13.421
after they've been sold
or launched or whatever,

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:15.065
we could actually change that,

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:18.136
and go from making people want our stuff,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.594
to just making stuff that people
want in the first place.

00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:24.405
The good news is, we're working
on digital nervous systems

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:27.230
that connect us to the things we design.

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:29.992
We're working on one project

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:33.728
with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles
called the Bandito Brothers

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.159
and their team.

00:12:35.183 --> 00:12:38.616
And one of the things these guys do
is build insane cars

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.513
that do absolutely insane things.

00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:44.355
These guys are crazy --

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.415
(Laughter)

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:46.842
in the best way.

00:12:48.993 --> 00:12:50.756
And what we're doing with them

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.220
is taking a traditional race-car chassis

00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:54.829
and giving it a nervous system.

00:12:54.853 --> 00:12:57.911
So we instrumented it
with dozens of sensors,

00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.570
put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.951
took it out to the desert
and drove the hell out of it for a week.

00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:06.466
And the car's nervous system
captured everything

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.972
that was happening to the car.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.617
We captured four billion data points;

00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:12.951
all of the forces
that it was subjected to.

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.634
And then we did something crazy.

00:13:15.268 --> 00:13:16.768
We took all of that data,

00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:20.528
and plugged it into a generative-design AI
we call "Dreamcatcher."

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.234
So what do get when you give
a design tool a nervous system,

00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.140
and you ask it to build you
the ultimate car chassis?

00:13:28.723 --> 00:13:30.696
You get this.

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:36.006
This is something that a human
could never have designed.

00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:38.595
Except a human did design this,

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:42.928
but it was a human that was augmented
by a generative-design AI,

00:13:42.952 --> 00:13:44.183
a digital nervous system

00:13:44.207 --> 00:13:47.212
and robots that can actually
fabricate something like this.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.275
So if this is the future,
the Augmented Age,

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:55.560
and we're going to be augmented
cognitively, physically and perceptually,

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:56.992
what will that look like?

00:13:57.576 --> 00:14:00.897
What is this wonderland going to be like?

00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:02.630
I think we're going to see a world

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:05.722
where we're moving
from things that are fabricated

00:14:05.746 --> 00:14:07.191
to things that are farmed.

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.612
Where we're moving from things
that are constructed

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:13.340
to that which is grown.

00:14:14.134 --> 00:14:16.322
We're going to move from being isolated

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:17.956
to being connected.

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:21.045
And we'll move away from extraction

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.942
to embrace aggregation.

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:27.734
I also think we'll shift
from craving obedience from our things

00:14:27.758 --> 00:14:29.399
to valuing autonomy.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.415
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.816
our world is going to change dramatically.

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.822
We're going to have a world
with more variety, more connectedness,

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:41.133
more dynamism, more complexity,

00:14:41.157 --> 00:14:43.475
more adaptability and, of course,

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:44.716
more beauty.

00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:46.795
The shape of things to come

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.109
will be unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:50.292
Why?

00:14:50.316 --> 00:14:54.071
Because what will be shaping those things
is this new partnership

00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:57.765
between technology, nature and humanity.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:03.083
That, to me, is a future
well worth looking forward to.

00:15:03.107 --> 00:15:04.378
Thank you all so much.

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:10.071
(Applause)
