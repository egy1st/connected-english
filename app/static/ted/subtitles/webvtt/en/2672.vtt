00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.416
Every summer, my family and I
travel across the world,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.296
3,000 miles away

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.920
to the culturally diverse
country of India.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.120
Now, India is a country infamous
for its scorching heat and humidity.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.200
For me, the only relief from this heat
is to drink plenty of water.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.416
Now, while in India,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.920
my parents always remind me
to only drink boiled or bottled water,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.656
because unlike here in America,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.880
where I can just turn on a tap
and easily get clean, potable water,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.000
in India, the water is often contaminated.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.336
So my parents have to make sure

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.320
that the water we drink is safe.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.856
However, I soon realized

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.536
that not everyone is fortunate enough

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.000
to enjoy the clean water we did.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.376
Outside my grandparents' house
in the busy streets of India,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.056
I saw people standing in long lines

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.776
under the hot sun

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080
filling buckets with water from a tap.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.336
I even saw children,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.016
who looked the same age as me,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.416
filling up these clear plastic bottles

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.520
with dirty water
from streams on the roadside.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.576
Watching these kids

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.736
forced to drink water

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.776
that I felt was too dirty to touch

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960
changed my perspective on the world.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.576
This unacceptable social injustice

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.656
compelled me to want to find a solution

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.640
to our world's clean water problem.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.096
I wanted to know
why these kids lacked water,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.560
a substance that is essential for life.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.256
And I learned that we are facing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.640
a global water crisis.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.536
Now, this may seem surprising,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.656
as 75 percent of our planet
is covered in water,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.736
but only 2.5 percent
of that is freshwater,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.696
and less than one percent
of Earth's freshwater supply

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.680
is available for human consumption.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.456
With rising populations,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.455
industrial development
and economic growth,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.256
our demand for clean water is increasing,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.480
yet our freshwater resources
are rapidly depleting.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.456
According to the
World Health Organization,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.376
660 million people in our world

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.000
lack access to a clean water source.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.256
Lack of access to clean water
is a leading cause of death

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.296
in children under the age of five
in developing countries,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.776
and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.520
die every day from
a water-related disease.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.656
So after returning home
one summer in eighth grade,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.776
I decided that I wanted
to combine my passion

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.936
for solving the global water crisis

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
with my interest in science.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.576
So I decided that the best thing to do

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.520
would be to convert my garage
into a laboratory.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.136
(Laughter)

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.016
Actually, at first I converted
my kitchen into a laboratory,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.880
but my parents didn't really approve
and kicked me out.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.856
I also read a lot of journal papers
on water-related research,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.736
and I learned that currently
in developing countries,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.176
something called solar disinfection,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.160
or SODIS, is used to purify water.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.816
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles
are filled with contaminated water

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.760
and then exposed to sunlight
for six to eight hours.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.536
The UV radiation from the sun

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.016
destroys the DNA
of these harmful pathogens

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.000
and decontaminates the water.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.616
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use
and energy-efficient,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.936
as it only uses solar energy,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.336
it's really slow,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120
as it can take up to two days
when it's cloudy.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.056
So in order to make
the SODIS process faster,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.376
this new method called photocatalysis

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.040
has recently been used.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.496
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.736
Let's break it down:

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.416
"photo" means from the sun,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.480
and a catalyst is something
that speeds up a reaction.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.216
So what photocatalysis is doing

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.400
is it's just speeding up
this solar disinfection process.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.736
When sunlight comes in
and strikes a photocatalyst,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.376
like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.816
it creates these
really reactive oxygen species,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.120
like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.816
These reactive oxygen species

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.736
are able to remove bacteria and organics

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.720
and a whole lot of contaminants
from drinking water.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.136
But unfortunately,
there are several disadvantages

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.040
to the way photocatalytic SODIS
is currently deployed.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.776
See, what they do is they take
the clear plastic bottles

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.240
and they coat the inside
with this photocatalytic coating.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.496
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.216
are actually commonly used in sunscreens

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.880
to block UV radiation.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.176
So when they're coated
on the inside of these bottles,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.976
they're actually blocking
some of the UV radiation

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.560
and diminishing the efficiency
of the process.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.696
Also, these photocatalytic coatings

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.576
are not tightly bound
to the plastic bottle,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.520
which means they wash off,
and people end up drinking the catalyst.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.176
While TiO2 is safe and inert,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.936
it's really inefficient
if you keep drinking the catalyst,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.336
because then you have
to continue to replenish it,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.840
even after a few uses.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.696
So my goal was
to overcome the disadvantages

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.736
of these current treatment methods

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.016
and create a safe, sustainable,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.960
cost-effective and eco-friendly
method of purifying water.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.176
What started off as an eighth grade
science fair project

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.600
is now my photocatalytic composite
for water purification.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.080
The composite combines
titanium dioxide with cement.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.816
The cement-like composite can be formed
into several different shapes,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.520
which results in an extremely
versatile range of deployment methods.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.216
For example, you could create a rod

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.920
that can easily be placed
inside water bottles for individual use

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.080
or you could create a porous filter
that can filter water for families.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.216
You can even coat the inside
of an existing water tank

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.096
to purify larger amounts of water

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.080
for communities
over a longer period of time.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.576
Now, over the course of this,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.056
my journey hasn't really been easy.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.456
You know, I didn't have access
to a sophisticated laboratory.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.976
I was 14 years old when I started,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.336
but I didn't let my age deter me

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.216
in my interest
in pursuing scientific research

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.720
and wanting to solve
the global water crisis.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.616
See, water isn't
just the universal solvent.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.440
Water is a universal human right.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.416
And for that reason,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.616
I'm continuing to work
on this science fair project from 2012

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.816
to bring it from the laboratory
into the real world.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.296
And this summer,
I founded Catalyst for World Water,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.600
a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing
solutions to the global water crisis.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.160
(Applause)

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.216
Alone, a single drop of water
can't do much,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.656
but when many drops come together,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.160
they can sustain life on our planet.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.616
Just as water drops
come together to form oceans,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.176
I believe that we all must come together

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.320
when tackling this global problem.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.296
Thank you.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320
(Applause)

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.176
Thank you.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.698
(Applause)
