00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:02.542
As an archaeologist,

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.664
I'm most often asked
what my favorite discovery is.

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.786
The answer's easy:

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.363
my husband, Greg.

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:11.758
(Laughter)

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:13.544
We met in Egypt on my first dig.

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:18.672
It was my first lesson in finding
unexpected, wonderful things.

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.090
This began an incredible
archaeological partnership.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:29.585
Years later, I proposed to him
in front of our favorite pair statue

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.770
of the Prince and Princess
Rahotep and Nofret,

00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:34.035
in the Cairo Museum,

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.154
dating to 4,600 years ago.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:41.639
I thought if I was going to ask Greg
to spend the rest of this life with me,

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:44.440
then I should ask him
in front of two people

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:47.545
who had pledged
to be together for eternity.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.058
These symbols endure
because when we look at them,

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:53.523
we're looking at mirrors.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.978
They are powerful reminders

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.811
that our common humanity has not changed.

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:05.187
The thrill of archaeological discovery
is as powerful as love,

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:10.258
because ancient history is the most
seductive mistress imaginable.

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:13.419
Many archaeologists
have devoted their lives

00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:15.872
to unraveling the mysteries of the past

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.552
under hot suns

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:20.039
and Arctic winds

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.428
and in dense rainforests.

00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:24.996
Many seek.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.171
Some discover.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:29.013
All worship at the temple of possibility

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.857
that one discovery might change history.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.125
On my first day in Egypt,
I worked at a site

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.789
in the Northeast Egyptian Delta
called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,

00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:42.964
in a cemetery.

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:44.188
That's a picture of me --

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:45.413
I'm just in my bliss.

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.901
On the dig, surrounded
by emerald green rice paddies,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.413
I discovered an intact pot.

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.398
Flipping it over,

00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:59.905
I discovered a human thumbprint
left by whoever made the vessel.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.958
For a moment, time stood still.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.414
I didn't know where I was.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:08.912
It was because at that moment I realized,

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.314
when we dig,

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:11.995
we're digging for people,

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.230
not things.

00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:19.615
Never are we so present as when
we are in the midst of the great past.

00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:25.331
I can't tell you how many times I've stood
in front of the Pyramids of Giza,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.620
and they leave me speechless.

00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:30.621
I feel like the luckiest
person in the world.

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:36.941
They're a monument to our human brilliance
and everything that is possible.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.826
Many cannot process
their brilliance as human --

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.451
they think aliens built them.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.440
But this is ridiculous.

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:48.576
All you need to do
is get up close and personal,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.072
and see the hidden hand of man

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:54.673
in the chisel marks left
by the tools that built them.

00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:59.956
The Great Pyramid of Giza
was built one stone at a time

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.148
with 2.3 million blocks,

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:05.870
with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:10.269
It is not the pyramids
that stand the test of time;

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:12.055
it is human ingenuity.

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:16.462
That is our shared human brilliance.

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.049
History may be cyclical,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:22.912
but we are singular.

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:25.344
I love what I do,

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:28.033
because I learn that we haven't changed.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:33.670
I get to read about mother-in-law
jokes from Mesopotamia

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.246
from 3,500 years ago.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.801
(Laughter)

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:41.379
I get to hear about neighbors
cursing each other

00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:43.901
from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:48.528
And my absolute favorite,
from 3,300 years ago in Luxor:

00:03:48.552 --> 00:03:54.060
an inscription that describes schoolboys
who cut class to go drinking.

00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:56.054
(Laughter)

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.046
Kids these days.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.394
(Laughter)

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:03.242
I get to see the most
incredible architecture,

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.174
see stunning sculptures --

00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:09.041
I mean, this is basically
a selfie in stone --

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.022
and see that we've always
rocked serious bling.

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.187
And also, we've been posting on walls

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.290
and obsessing about cats --

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:19.321
(Laughter)

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:20.858
for thousands of years.

00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:21.889
(Laughter)

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:24.249
(Applause)

00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:30.136
Archaeologists are the cultural
memory preservers

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.801
and the spokespeople

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.157
for the billions of people
and the thousands of cultures

00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:36.515
that came before us.

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:40.231
Good science, imagination
and a leap of faith

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:43.695
are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.164
In the last year,

00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:49.364
archaeologists have made
incredible discoveries, including:

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.516
new human ancestors from South Africa;

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.578
tools from 3.3 million years ago --

00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:58.838
these are the oldest tools
ever discovered --

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.210
in Kenya.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.878
And this, from a series
of medical implements found

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.720
from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:12.238
What you're looking at is a medical tool
used to treat syphilis.

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.639
Ouch!

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:16.023
(Laughter)

00:05:16.047 --> 00:05:17.391
For each of these,

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:20.858
there are thousands of other
incredibly important discoveries

00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:22.354
made by my colleagues,

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:23.828
that do not make headlines.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:30.898
However, I believe that the most
important thing we do as archaeologists

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:34.613
is acknowledge that past people existed

00:05:34.637 --> 00:05:36.511
and lived lives worth learning about.

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:41.335
Can you even imagine
what the world would be like today

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:44.601
if we acknowledged all
human beings in this way?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.836
So, on a dig, we have a challenge:

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:52.552
it often looks like this.

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.410
You can't see anything.

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:56.183
Where are we going to start digging?

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:57.918
This is from a site south of Cairo.

00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:59.675
Let's have a look from space.

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.527
Again, you can't really see much.

00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:06.338
What you're looking at
is a WorldView-3 satellite image,

00:06:06.362 --> 00:06:09.421
which has a .3 meter resolution.

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:10.823
That's 10 inches.

00:06:10.847 --> 00:06:15.121
This means that you can zoom in
from 400 miles in space

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.582
and see your tablets.

00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.007
How do I know about this?

00:06:19.864 --> 00:06:22.988
It's because I'm a space archaeologist.

00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:25.571
Let me repeat that.

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:28.812
I am a space archaeologist.

00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:29.988
This means --

00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:31.258
(Applause)

00:06:31.282 --> 00:06:32.568
Thank you.

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:37.427
This means I use satellite images
and process them using algorithms,

00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:40.087
and look at subtle differences
in the light spectrum

00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:42.425
that indicate buried things
under the ground

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.918
that I get to go excavate and survey.

00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:46.657
By the way --

00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.258
NASA has a Space Archaeology program,

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.768
so it's a real job.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:51.942
(Laughter)

00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:54.015
So, let's have a look again.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.124
We're back at the site
just south of Cairo.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:57.831
You can't see anything.

00:06:57.855 --> 00:07:01.233
Keep your eye on the red rectangle.

00:07:01.257 --> 00:07:03.884
When we process the image
using algorithms --

00:07:03.908 --> 00:07:06.313
think like a space-based CAT scan --

00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:09.485
this is what you see.

00:07:10.074 --> 00:07:13.783
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.408
that is previously unknown
and unexcavated,

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:21.193
and you all are the first people
to see it in thousands of years.

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:27.299
(Applause)

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:30.150
I believe we have barely
scratched the surface

00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:32.254
in terms of what's left to discover.

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:35.096
In the Egyptian Delta alone,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.938
we've excavated less
than one-1000th of one percent

00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.675
of the total volume of Egyptian sites.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.654
When you add to that
the thousands of other sites

00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:46.710
my team and I have discovered,

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:50.489
what we thought we knew
pales in comparison

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:52.411
to what we have left to discover.

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:54.921
When you look at the incredible work

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.366
that my colleagues are doing
all around the world

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.197
and what they're finding,

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:04.819
I believe that there are millions
of undiscovered archaeological sites

00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:06.003
left to find.

00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:09.189
Discovering them will do nothing less

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:12.927
than unlock the full potential
of our existence.

00:08:14.414 --> 00:08:16.729
But we have a challenge.

00:08:17.323 --> 00:08:18.910
Over the last year,

00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:21.558
we've seen horrible headlines

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:25.904
of incredible destruction going on
to archaeological sites,

00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:28.733
and massive looting by people like ISIL.

00:08:29.594 --> 00:08:33.216
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.855
Who blows up a temple?

00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.516
They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.011
And we've seen looting
at sites so rampant,

00:08:43.035 --> 00:08:45.855
it looks like craters of the moon.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.460
Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy
modern human lives,

00:08:51.484 --> 00:08:55.872
it's a natural extension for them
to destroy cultural identity as well.

00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:59.050
Countless invading armies
have done the same throughout history.

00:08:59.818 --> 00:09:03.677
We know that ISIL is profiting
from the looting of sites,

00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:05.242
but we don't know the scale.

00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:09.935
This means that any object
purchased on the market today

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.115
from the Middle East

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:13.773
could potentially be funding terrorism.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.589
When a site is looted,

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:22.393
it's as if a puzzle already missing
90 percent of it pieces

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.179
has had the rest obscured
beyond recognition.

00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:28.208
This is ancient identity theft writ large.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.226
We know that there are two kinds
of looting going on:

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.936
looting by criminal elements like ISIL,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.826
and then more local looting
by those that are desperate for money.

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:41.491
We would all do the same
to feed our families;

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.664
I don't blame the local looters.

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:48.366
I blame the middlemen,
the unethical traffickers

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.374
and an international art market

00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:55.789
that exploits often ambiguous
or even completely nonexistent laws.

00:09:56.938 --> 00:10:01.321
We know looting is going on
on a global scale and it's increasing,

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:04.429
but presently we don't have
any tools to stop it.

00:10:05.122 --> 00:10:06.617
This is beginning to change.

00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:11.740
My team and I have just completed a study
looking at looting in Egypt.

00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.111
We looked at open-source data

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:17.070
and mapped the entirety
of looting across Egypt

00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:19.637
from 2002 to 2013.

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:25.030
We found evidence of looting
and site destruction at 267 sites,

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:29.031
and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:31.074
It's astonishing.

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:32.771
And putting that data together --

00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:35.290
you can see the looting pits marked here.

00:10:36.442 --> 00:10:41.733
At one site, the looting got bad
from 2009, 2011, 2012 --

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:43.318
hundreds and hundreds of pits.

00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:45.215
Putting all the data together,

00:10:45.239 --> 00:10:48.290
what we found is that,
contrary to popular opinion,

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:53.375
looting did not start to get worse
in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:56.991
but in 2009, after the global recession.

00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:00.160
Thus, we've shown with big data

00:11:00.184 --> 00:11:03.647
that looting is fundamentally
an economic issue.

00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:08.149
If we do nothing to stop the problem,

00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:12.232
all of Egypt's sites will be affected
by looting by 2040.

00:11:12.684 --> 00:11:15.856
Thus, we are at a tipping point.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.003
We are the generation with all the tools
and all the technologies

00:11:19.027 --> 00:11:20.237
to stop looting,

00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:22.754
but we're not working fast enough.

00:11:25.968 --> 00:11:30.523
Sometimes an archaeological site
can surprise you with its resilience.

00:11:31.413 --> 00:11:33.769
I am just back from the field,

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:37.372
where I co-led a joint mission
with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.208
at a site called Lisht.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:44.054
This site dates to the Middle Kingdom
of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.

00:11:44.494 --> 00:11:47.249
The Middle Kingdom was Ancient
Egypt's Renaissance period.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:51.177
After a time of intense internal strife
and environmental challenges,

00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:52.455
Egypt rebounded

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:57.436
with an incredible resurgence
of art, architecture and literature.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.858
It's a favorite period of time
to study in Egypt,

00:11:59.882 --> 00:12:04.088
because it teaches us so much
about how we can survive and thrive

00:12:04.112 --> 00:12:05.327
after great disasters.

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:10.456
Now at this site, we had already mapped
countless looting pits.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.643
Lisht is a royal site;

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.341
there would have been thousands
of people buried there

00:12:14.365 --> 00:12:16.479
who lived and worked
at the court of Pharaoh.

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.671
You can see this before and after;
you see dozens of looting pits.

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:20.867
North Lisht.

00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:23.354
This is in South Lisht, before and after.

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:26.472
When we first visited the site,

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.100
we could see the tombs
of many high-ranking officials

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.464
that had been looted.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.472
Let me put into perspective
for you what was taken.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.175
Imagine a two meter by two meter area
full of coffins, jewelry

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.709
and incredible statuary.

00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:44.063
Multiply that times over a thousand.

00:12:45.302 --> 00:12:46.769
That's what was taken.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.908
So, when we started work,

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.084
my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,
approached me and said,

00:12:52.108 --> 00:12:54.369
"We must work at this one particular tomb.

00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:56.702
It's been attacked by looters.

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:58.742
If we don't do anything, they'll be back."

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:02.162
Of course I agreed,
but I didn't think we'd find anything.

00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:04.308
I thought the looters
had stolen everything.

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:07.329
What we started to find
were the most incredible reliefs.

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.519
Look at this painting --
it's just stunning.

00:13:09.543 --> 00:13:12.198
We started finding engraved inscriptions.

00:13:12.222 --> 00:13:14.293
And even the titles of the tomb owner --

00:13:14.317 --> 00:13:16.628
he had titles like,
"Overseer of the Army,"

00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:18.079
"Overseer of the Treasury."

00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:19.293
I began to have hope.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:23.304
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.

00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:26.315
For the ancient Egyptians, having
their name last for eternity

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:27.557
was their goal.

00:13:28.396 --> 00:13:29.969
And then one day,

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:31.174
this appeared.

00:13:31.768 --> 00:13:35.657
This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.

00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:38.835
You can see it written out
here, in hieroglyphs.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.615
Working together with my Egyptian team,

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:45.601
we had restored someone's name
from 3,900 years ago.

00:13:45.942 --> 00:13:52.815
(Applause)

00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:55.918
Working together
with my Egyptian colleagues,

00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:58.220
we celebrated this moment
of shared discovery.

00:13:58.244 --> 00:14:00.782
What we were doing together
was right and true.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.049
We found this incredible
false door, mostly intact.

00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:07.197
On it we read about Intef
and his inscriptions.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.831
You can actually even see him seated here.

00:14:11.272 --> 00:14:15.865
What I realized is that everything
I had assumed about looted sites

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.101
had been proven wrong.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.905
Every day on site we worked
together with 70 Egyptians

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:23.009
as colleagues and friends.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.525
In the face of so much
hatred and ignorance

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:28.549
against those in the Middle East,

00:14:28.573 --> 00:14:32.292
every moment on site felt like
a protest for peace.

00:14:33.326 --> 00:14:35.677
When you work with those
that don't look like you,

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:37.793
or think like you, or speak like you,

00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:40.697
your shared mission
of archaeological discovery

00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.657
erases all superficial differences.

00:14:45.068 --> 00:14:46.608
What I learned this season

00:14:46.632 --> 00:14:49.248
is that archaeology
isn't about what you find.

00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:52.492
It's about what you can prove possible.

00:14:53.373 --> 00:14:56.510
Sometimes when you travel,
you end up finding long-lost family --

00:14:56.534 --> 00:14:59.041
not those with whom you share genes,

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.056
but a shared entry in the book of life.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:04.208
This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:09.557
Omer's a Gufti from a village
just North of Luxor, called Guft.

00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:12.202
Guftis are part of a celebrated
tradition in Egyptology.

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:14.995
They help with digging
and work crew organization.

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:17.931
Omer is my COO and CFO.

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:19.980
I simply couldn't do work without him.

00:15:21.146 --> 00:15:24.544
One day many years ago,
when I was a young graduate student

00:15:24.568 --> 00:15:28.651
and Omer was a young Gufti
who couldn't speak much English,

00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:30.651
we learned, completely randomly,

00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:33.121
that we were born in the same year,

00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:35.590
the same month

00:15:35.614 --> 00:15:39.254
and the same day, six hours apart.

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:41.769
Twins.

00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.187
(Laughter)

00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:46.334
Separated by an ocean,
but forever connected

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:48.431
for Ancient Egypt is our mother.

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:51.240
I knew then we'd always work together --

00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:52.621
not in my brain,

00:15:53.517 --> 00:15:58.014
but in the part of your soul that knows
not everything can be explained.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.877
(Arabic) Omer by brother,

00:16:02.743 --> 00:16:05.662
I will always love you.

00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:09.887
(English) Omer my brother,
I will always love you.

00:16:11.252 --> 00:16:13.479
So, just before my first dig in Egypt,

00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:17.197
my mentor, the very famous Egyptologist
Professor William Kelly Simpson,

00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:18.516
called me into his office.

00:16:19.049 --> 00:16:22.406
He handed me a check for $2,000,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.104
and said, "This is to cover your expenses.

00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:27.232
Have a glorious adventure this summer.

00:16:27.728 --> 00:16:31.137
Someday you will do this
for someone else."

00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:36.272
Thus, my TED Prize wish
is partial payback, plus interest --

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.550
(Laughter)

00:16:37.574 --> 00:16:41.731
for a great human being's
generosity and kindness.

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:44.976
So, my wish.

00:16:45.835 --> 00:16:51.502
I wish for us to discover the millions
of unknown archaeological sites

00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:53.137
around the world.

00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:57.599
By creating a 21st-century army
of global explorers,

00:16:57.623 --> 00:17:00.643
we'll find and protect
the world's hidden heritage,

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:05.278
which contains clues
to humankind's collective resilience

00:17:05.302 --> 00:17:06.612
and creativity.

00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:09.130
(Applause)

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.344
Thank you.

00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:13.340
(Applause)

00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:20.315
So how are we going to do this?

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.471
We are going to build
with the TED Prize money

00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:28.553
an online, crowdsource,
citizen science platform

00:17:28.577 --> 00:17:32.863
to allow anyone in the world
to engage with discovering

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.314
archaeological sites.

00:17:35.843 --> 00:17:39.469
There are only a couple hundred of us
space archaeologists around the world.

00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:42.164
It is my dream to engage the world

00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:44.706
with helping to find sites
and protect them.

00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:48.803
What you'll do is sign in,
create a username --

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:51.488
note that this particular username
is already taken.

00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:53.370
(Laughter)

00:17:53.394 --> 00:17:55.555
You'll take a tutorial
and you'll start work.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:56.994
I want to note at the outset

00:17:57.018 --> 00:18:01.113
that in no way will be sharing
GPS data or mapping data for sites.

00:18:01.137 --> 00:18:03.640
We want to treat them
like human patient data,

00:18:03.664 --> 00:18:05.427
and not reveal their locations.

00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:10.219
You'll then be dealt a card from a deck --
20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters,

00:18:10.243 --> 00:18:12.465
and you'll be looking for features.

00:18:12.489 --> 00:18:14.459
My team and I will have batch-processed

00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:16.986
large amounts of satellite data
using algorithms

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.553
in order for you to find things,

00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:20.452
so you'll be doing really good science.

00:18:20.476 --> 00:18:22.042
You'll then be starting to look.

00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:23.988
What do you see? Do you see a temple?

00:18:24.012 --> 00:18:26.948
Do you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:30.504
Do you see any potential
site damage or site looting?

00:18:30.528 --> 00:18:32.634
You'll then begin to mark what's there.

00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:36.152
And off to the side are always
going to be rich examples

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:39.121
of exactly what you're seeing,
to help guide you.

00:18:39.145 --> 00:18:43.592
All the data that you help us collect
will be shared with vetted authorities,

00:18:43.616 --> 00:18:46.812
and will help create
a new global alarm system

00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:48.615
to help protect sites.

00:18:49.552 --> 00:18:51.476
But it's not just going to stop there.

00:18:52.668 --> 00:18:55.662
All the archaeologists with whom
we share your discoveries

00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:59.416
will take you with them
as they begin to excavate them,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.602
by using Periscope, Google Plus
and social media.

00:19:05.398 --> 00:19:08.452
A hundred years ago,
archaeology was for the rich.

00:19:09.469 --> 00:19:11.180
Fifty years ago,

00:19:11.204 --> 00:19:12.382
it was for men.

00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:15.128
Now it's primarily for academics.

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:20.510
Our goal is to democratize the process
of archaeological discovery,

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:23.095
and allow anyone to participate.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.063
Ninety-four years ago,

00:19:26.087 --> 00:19:28.877
Howard Carter discovered
the tomb of King Tut.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.036
Who is the next Howard Carter?

00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:35.075
It might be you.

00:19:38.098 --> 00:19:39.706
By creating this platform,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:44.455
we will find the millions of places
occupied by the billions of people

00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:45.905
that came before us.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.912
If we want to answer
the big questions about who we are

00:19:49.936 --> 00:19:51.197
and where we've come from,

00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:55.660
the answers to those questions
do not lie in pyramids or palaces,

00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:59.732
but in the cities and villages
of those that came before us.

00:20:00.561 --> 00:20:03.152
If we want to learn about the past,

00:20:03.176 --> 00:20:05.594
it's time we inverted the pyramids.

00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:10.798
Acknowledging that the past
is worth saving

00:20:10.822 --> 00:20:12.362
means so much more.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:17.279
It means that we're worth saving, too.

00:20:18.386 --> 00:20:21.998
And the greatest story ever told

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.080
is the story of our shared human journey.

00:20:27.532 --> 00:20:30.825
But the only way we're going
to be able to write it
