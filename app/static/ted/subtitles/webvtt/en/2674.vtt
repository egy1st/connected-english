00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.810
Back in 2003,

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.343
the UK government carried out a survey.

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:10.643
And it was a survey that measured
levels of numeracy

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.904
in the population.

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.571
And they were shocked to find out

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.959
that for every 100 working age
adults in the country,

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.484
47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:25.004
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --
that's low-end GCSE score.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.658
It's the ability to deal with fractions,
percentages and decimals.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:33.310
So this figure prompted
a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:34.962
Policies were changed,

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:36.708
investments were made,

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.770
and then they ran
the survey again in 2011.

00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:41.999
So can you guess
what happened to this number?

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:45.465
It went up to 49.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.938
(Laughter)

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.411
And in fact, when I reported
this figure in the FT,

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.106
one of our readers joked and said,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.891
"This figure is only shocking
to 51 percent of the population."

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:57.201
(Laughter)

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.382
But I preferred, actually,
the reaction of a schoolchild

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.501
when I presented
at a school this information,

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.056
who raised their hand and said,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.596
"How do we know that the person
who made that number

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.435
isn't one of the 49 percent either?"

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.713
(Laughter)

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.787
So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,

00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:16.921
because these are
important skills for life,

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:20.812
and a lot of the changes
that we want to introduce in this century

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.277
involve us becoming
more comfortable with numbers.

00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:25.149
Now, it's not just an English problem.

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:30.103
OECD this year released some figures
looking at numeracy in young people,

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.907
and leading the way, the USA --

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.601
nearly 40 percent of young people
in the US have low numeracy.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:38.922
Now, England is there too,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:44.479
but there are seven OECD countries
with figures above 20 percent.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.262
That is a problem,
because it doesn't have to be that way.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.294
If you look at the far end of this graph,

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:52.278
you can see the Netherlands and Korea
are in single figures.

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:56.718
So there's definitely a numeracy
problem that we want to address.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.440
Now, as useful as studies like these are,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:05.864
I think we risk herding people
inadvertently into one of two categories;

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:07.664
that there are two kinds of people:

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:12.037
those people that are comfortable
with numbers, that can do numbers,

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.297
and the people who can't.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.422
And what I'm trying
to talk about here today

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.488
is to say that I believe
that is a false dichotomy.

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:21.380
It's not an immutable pairing.

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:25.052
I think you don't have to have
tremendously high levels of numeracy

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:26.804
to be inspired by numbers,

00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:29.937
and that should be the starting point
to the journey ahead.

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:34.698
And one of the ways in which
we can begin that journey, for me,

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.448
is looking at statistics.

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:39.967
Now, I am the first to acknowledge
that statistics has got somewhat

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.309
of an image problem.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.380
(Laughter)

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:43.936
It's the part of mathematics

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.019
that even mathematicians
don't particularly like,

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:51.055
because whereas the rest of maths
is all about precision and certainty,

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.363
statistics is almost the reverse of that.

00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:58.448
But actually, I was a late convert
to the world of statistics myself.

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.554
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors

00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:05.337
what two subjects would I be least likely
to excel in after university,

00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:08.128
they'd have told you statistics
and computer programming,

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:11.091
and yet here I am, about to show you
some statistical graphics

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:12.317
that I programmed.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:14.500
So what inspired that change in me?

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:18.172
What made me think that statistics
was actually an interesting thing?

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.462
It's really because
statistics are about us.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.451
If you look at the etymology
of the word statistics,

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:26.084
it's the science of dealing with data

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:28.538
about the state or the community
that we live in.

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.916
So statistics are about us as a group,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.615
not us as individuals.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.109
And I think as social animals,

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:39.077
we share this fascination about how
we as individuals relate to our groups,

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.489
to our peers.

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:43.623
And statistics in this way
are at their most powerful

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:44.948
when they surprise us.

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:48.684
And there's been some really wonderful
surveys carried out recently

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.422
by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.154
They did a survey of over
1,000 adults in the UK,

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:56.958
and said, for every 100 people
in England and Wales,

00:03:56.982 --> 00:03:58.852
how many of them are Muslim?

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.522
Now the average answer from this survey,

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:04.958
which was supposed to be representative
of the total population, was 24.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:08.658
That's what people thought.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.321
British people think 24 out of every 100
people in the country are Muslim.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:16.755
Now, official figures reveal
that figure to be about five.

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:21.719
So there's this big variation
between what we think, our perception,

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:23.781
and the reality as given by statistics.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.349
And I think that's interesting.

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:28.663
What could possibly be causing
that misperception?

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.066
And I was so thrilled with this study,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.570
I started to take questions out
in presentations. I was referring to it.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:35.812
Now, I did a presentation

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:38.146
at St. Paul's School for Girls
in Hammersmith,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.310
and I had an audience rather like this,

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:44.202
except it was comprised entirely
of sixth-form girls.

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:46.622
And I said, "Girls,

00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:52.141
how many teenage girls do you think
the British public think

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:53.913
get pregnant every year?"

00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:56.613
And the girls were apoplectic when I said

00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.366
the British public think that 15
out of every 100 teenage girls

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.683
get pregnant in the year.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:05.660
And they had every right to be angry,

00:05:05.684 --> 00:05:08.442
because in fact, I'd have to have
closer to 200 dots

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:10.036
before I could color one in,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.575
in terms of what
the official figures tell us.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.399
And rather like numeracy,
this is not just an English problem.

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:20.927
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey
in recent years to go across the world.

00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.901
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.446
for every 100 adults in your country,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.343
how many of them are overweight or obese?

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:35.859
And the average answer from the Saudis
was just over a quarter.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.604
That's what they thought.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.196
Just over a quarter of adults
are overweight or obese.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.001
The official figures show, actually,
it's nearer to three-quarters.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.481
(Laughter)

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:48.797
So again, a big variation.

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:53.267
And I love this one: they asked in Japan,
they asked the Japanese,

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.251
for every 100 Japanese people,

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.876
how many of them live in rural areas?

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.422
The average was about a 50-50 split,
just over halfway.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.593
They thought 56 out of every 100
Japanese people lived in rural areas.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.304
The official figure is seven.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.709
So extraordinary variations,
and surprising to some,

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:17.122
but not surprising to people
who have read the work

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:21.538
of Daniel Kahneman, for example,
the Nobel-winning economist.

00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:26.654
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,
spent years researching this disjoint

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.823
between what people perceive
and the reality,

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.598
the fact that people are actually
pretty poor intuitive statisticians.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:35.382
And there are many reasons for this.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:38.521
Individual experiences, certainly,
can influence our perceptions,

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:42.503
but so, too, can things like the media
reporting things by exception,

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.223
rather than what's normal.

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:46.981
Kahneman had a nice way
of referring to that.

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:49.090
He said, "We can be blind
to the obvious" --

00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:50.752
so we've got the numbers wrong --

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.098
"but we can be blind
to our blindness about it."

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:56.388
And that has enormous
repercussions for decision making.

00:06:56.412 --> 00:06:59.264
So at the statistics office
while this was all going on,

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:01.200
I thought this was really interesting.

00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:03.234
I said, this is clearly a global problem,

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:05.693
but maybe geography is the issue here.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:09.626
These were questions that were all about,
how well do you know your country?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.643
So in this case, it's how well
do you know 64 million people?

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.399
Not very well, it turns out.
I can't do that.

00:07:16.423 --> 00:07:17.747
So I had an idea,

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.894
which was to think about
this same sort of approach

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:23.023
but to think about it
in a very local sense.

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.238
Is this a local?

00:07:24.262 --> 00:07:26.203
If we reframe the questions and say,

00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:28.349
how well do you know your local area,

00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:30.476
would your answers be any more accurate?

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.579
So I devised a quiz:

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:35.462
How well do you know your area?

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:38.343
It's a simple Web app.

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:39.550
You put in a post code

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:42.281
and then it will ask you questions
based on census data

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:43.844
for your local area.

00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:46.428
And I was very conscious
in designing this.

00:07:46.452 --> 00:07:50.561
I wanted to make it open
to the widest possible range of people,

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:53.413
not just the 49 percent
who can get the numbers.

00:07:53.437 --> 00:07:55.192
I wanted everyone to engage with it.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:56.741
So for the design of the quiz,

00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.380
I was inspired by the isotypes

00:08:00.404 --> 00:08:03.006
of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.378
Now, these are methods
for representing numbers

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.175
using repeating icons.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.805
And the numbers are there,
but they sit in the background.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:15.552
So it's a great way
of representing quantity

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:18.560
without resorting to using terms
like "percentage,"

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:19.814
"fractions" and "ratios."

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:21.540
So here's the quiz.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.957
The layout of the quiz is,

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.800
you have your repeating icons
on the left-hand side there,

00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:29.947
and a map showing you the area
we're asking you questions about

00:08:29.971 --> 00:08:31.138
on the right-hand side.

00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:32.443
There are seven questions.

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:36.360
Each question, there's a possible answer
between zero and a hundred,

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.733
and at the end of the quiz,

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:40.975
you get an overall score
between zero and a hundred.

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:43.083
And so because this is TEDxExeter,

00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:45.432
I thought we would have
a quick look at the quiz

00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:47.765
for the first few questions of Exeter.

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:49.194
And so the first question is:

00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:52.210
For every 100 people,
how many are aged under 16?

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:56.384
Now, I don't know Exeter very well
at all, so I had a guess at this,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.969
but it gives you an idea
of how this quiz works.

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:02.699
You drag the slider
to highlight your icons,

00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:04.958
and then just click "Submit" to answer,

00:09:04.982 --> 00:09:08.645
and we animate away the difference
between your answer and reality.

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:12.744
And it turns out, I was a pretty
terrible guess: five.

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:14.573
How about the next question?

00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:16.753
This is asking about
what the average age is,

00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:19.222
so the age at which half
the population are younger

00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:20.920
and half the population are older.

00:09:20.944 --> 00:09:24.294
And I thought 35 -- that sounds
middle-aged to me.

00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:25.761
(Laughter)

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:30.312
Actually, in Exeter,
it's incredibly young,

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:34.874
and I had underestimated the impact
of the university in this area.

00:09:34.898 --> 00:09:36.929
The questions get harder
as you go through.

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:39.336
So this one's now asking
about homeownership:

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:43.654
For every 100 households, how many
are owned with a mortgage or loan?

00:09:43.678 --> 00:09:44.958
And I hedged my bets here,

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:48.080
because I didn't want to be
more than 50 out on the answer.

00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:50.124
(Laughter)

00:09:50.148 --> 00:09:52.614
And actually, these get harder,
these questions,

00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:55.497
because when you're in an area,
when you're in a community,

00:09:55.521 --> 00:10:00.771
things like age -- there are clues
to whether a population is old or young.

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:03.140
Just by looking around
the area, you can see it.

00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:06.555
Something like homeownership
is much more difficult to see,

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:09.187
so we revert to our own heuristics,

00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.662
our own biases about how many people
we think own their own homes.

00:10:13.686 --> 00:10:17.336
Now the truth is,
when we published this quiz,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.896
the census data that it's based on
was already a few years old.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.489
We've had online applications
that allow you to put in a post code

00:10:24.513 --> 00:10:26.607
and get statistics back for years.

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.820
So in some senses,

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:31.393
this was all a little bit old
and not necessarily new.

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:35.056
But I was interested to see
what reaction we might get

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.797
by gamifying the data
in the way that we have,

00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:39.228
by using animation

00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:43.000
and playing on the fact
that people have their own preconceptions.

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:47.091
It turns out, the reaction was, um ...

00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:50.256
was more than I could have hoped for.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.661
It was a long-held ambition of mine
to bring down a statistics website

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.093
due to public demand.

00:10:55.117 --> 00:10:56.917
(Laughter)

00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:00.405
This URL contains the words
"statistics," "gov" and "UK,"

00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:03.671
which are three of people's least
favorite words in a URL.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:07.680
And the amazing thing about this
was that the website came down

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:09.797
at quarter to 10 at night,

00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:13.032
because people were actually
engaging with this data

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:14.595
of their own free will,

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.654
using their own personal time.

00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:19.165
I was very interested to see

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:22.902
that we got something like
a quarter of a million people

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:26.198
playing the quiz within the space
of 48 hours of launching it.

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:30.149
And it sparked an enormous discussion
online, on social media,

00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:32.210
which was largely dominated

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:36.227
by people having fun
with their misconceptions,

00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:39.310
which is something that
I couldn't have hoped for any better,

00:11:39.334 --> 00:11:40.494
in some respects.

00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:43.744
I also liked the fact that people started
sending it to politicians.

00:11:43.768 --> 00:11:46.357
How well do you know the area
you claim to represent?

00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:47.543
(Laughter)

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:49.127
And then just to finish,

00:11:49.992 --> 00:11:52.322
going back to the two kinds of people,

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:54.603
I thought it would be
really interesting to see

00:11:54.627 --> 00:11:57.442
how people who are good with numbers
would do on this quiz.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.482
The national statistician
of England and Wales, John Pullinger,

00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:02.579
you would expect he would be pretty good.

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:05.973
He got 44 for his own area.

00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:08.465
(Laughter)

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:13.438
Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly,
after a glass of wine -- 36.

00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:15.512
Even worse.

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:18.737
It just shows you that the numbers
can inspire us all.

00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:20.021
They can surprise us all.

00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:22.084
So very often, we talk about statistics

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.070
as being the science of uncertainty.

00:12:24.094 --> 00:12:25.876
My parting thought for today is:

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.935
actually, statistics is the science of us.

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:31.747
And that's why we should
be fascinated by numbers.

00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:32.961
Thank you very much.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:36.762
(Applause)
