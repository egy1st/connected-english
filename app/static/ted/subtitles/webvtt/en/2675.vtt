00:00:00.678 --> 00:00:03.274
One summer afternoon in 2013,

00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:06.426
DC police detained, questioned
and searched a man

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.542
who appeared suspicious
and potentially dangerous.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.761
This wasn't what I was wearing
the day of the detention, to be fair,

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.608
but I have a picture of that as well.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.328
I know it's very frightening --
try to remain calm.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.445
(Laughter)

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.891
At this time, I was interning

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.647
at the Public Defender Service
in Washington DC,

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:27.090
and I was visiting
a police station for work.

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:28.274
I was on my way out,

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.290
and before I could make it to my car,

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.615
two police cars pulled up
to block my exit,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.970
and an officer approached me from behind.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.266
He told me to stop, take my backpack off

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.366
and put my hands on the police car
parked next to us.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.795
About a dozen officers
then gathered near us.

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:45.066
All of them had handguns,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.430
some had assault rifles.

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.188
They rifled through my backpack.

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:49.617
They patted me down.

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.002
They took pictures of me
spread on the police car,

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:53.182
and they laughed.

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.746
And as all this was happening --

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.020
as I was on the police car trying
to ignore the shaking in my legs,

00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:00.379
trying to think clearly
about what I should do --

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.402
something stuck out to me as odd.

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.420
When I look at myself in this photo,

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:06.279
if I were to describe myself,

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.090
I think I'd say something like,

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:13.503
"19-year-old Indian male,
bright T-shirt, wearing glasses."

00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:15.808
But they weren't including
any of these details.

00:01:15.832 --> 00:01:18.082
Into their police radios
as they described me,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:20.738
they kept saying, "Middle Eastern
male with a backpack.

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:22.791
Middle Eastern male with a backpack."

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.888
And this description carried on
into their police reports.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:31.025
I never expected to be described
by my own government in these terms:

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.307
"lurking,"

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.532
"nefarious,"

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:36.992
"terrorist."

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:38.959
And the detention dragged on like this.

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:42.861
They sent dogs trained to smell explosives
to sweep the area I'd been in.

00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:46.312
They called the federal government
to see if I was on any watch lists.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:49.187
They sent a couple of detectives
to cross-examine me on why,

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:51.327
if I claimed I had nothing to hide,

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.397
I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.482
And I could see
they weren't happy with me,

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.589
but I felt I had no way of knowing
what they'd want to do next.

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.510
At one point, the officer
who patted me down

00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:05.064
scanned the side of the police station
to see where the security camera was

00:02:05.088 --> 00:02:07.960
to see how much of this
was being recorded.

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:09.152
And when he did that,

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:12.646
it really sank in how completely
I was at their mercy.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.093
I think we're all normalized
from a young age

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:18.870
to the idea of police officers
and arrests and handcuffs,

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:22.836
so it's easy to forget how demeaning
and coercive a thing it is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.765
to seize control over
another person's body.

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.834
I know it sounds like
the point of my story

00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:30.300
is how badly treated I was
because of my race --

00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:33.444
and yes, I don't think I would've been
detained if I were white.

00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:36.207
But actually, what I have in mind
today is something else.

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:38.949
What I have in mind is how
much worse things might've been

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.137
if I weren't affluent.

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.079
I mean, they thought I might be trying
to plant an explosive,

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.272
and they investigated that possibility
for an hour and a half,

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.008
but I was never put in handcuffs,

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.044
I was never taken to a jail cell.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.128
I think if I were from one of Washington
DC's poor communities of color,

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:56.575
and they thought I was
endangering officers' lives,

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.220
things might've ended differently.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.648
And in fact, in our system, I think
it's better to be an affluent person

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:03.960
suspected of trying
to blow up a police station

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.651
than it is to be a poor person

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:08.332
who's suspected of much,
much less than this.

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.931
I want to give you an example
from my current work.

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.559
Right now, I'm working
at a civil rights organization in DC,

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.915
called Equal Justice Under Law.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.848
Let me start by asking you all a question.

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:22.859
How many of you have ever gotten
a parking ticket in your life?

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:24.047
Raise your hand.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.017
Yeah. So have I.

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:27.374
And when I had to pay it,

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:29.429
it felt annoying and it felt bad,

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.369
but I paid it and I moved on.

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:34.084
I'm guessing most of you
have paid your tickets as well.

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:38.903
But what would happen if you
couldn't afford the amount on the ticket

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.097
and your family doesn't have
the money either, what happens then?

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.112
Well, one thing that's not supposed
to happen under the law is,

00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:47.240
you're not supposed to be
arrested and jailed

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:49.360
simply because you can't afford to pay.

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.188
That's illegal under federal law.

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:54.140
But that's what local governments
across the country are doing

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.321
to people who are poor.

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:58.265
And so many of our lawsuits
at Equal Justice Under Law

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.742
target these modern-day debtors' prisons.

00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.492
One of our cases is against
Ferguson, Missouri.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:06.340
And I know when I say Ferguson,

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:08.462
many of you will think of police violence.

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:10.773
But today I want to talk
about a different aspect

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:14.263
of the relationship between
their police force and their citizens.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.821
Ferguson was issuing an average
of over two arrest warrants,

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.852
per person, per year,

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:22.124
mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.019
When I imagine what that would feel like
if, every time I left my house,

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:30.143
there was a chance a police officer
would run my license plate,

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:31.858
see a warrant for unpaid debt,

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:34.012
seize my body they way the did in DC

00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.953
and then take me to a jail cell,

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:37.611
I feel a little sick.

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.994
I've met many of the people in Ferguson
who have experienced this,

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:43.805
and I've heard some of their stories.

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.197
In Ferguson's jail,

00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.330
in each small cell,
there's a bunk bed and a toilet,

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.656
but they'd pack four people
into each cell.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.795
So there'd be two people on the bunks
and two people on the floor,

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.746
one with nowhere to go except
right next to the filthy toilet,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.930
which was never cleaned.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.117
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,

00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:03.696
so the floor and the walls were lined
with blood and mucus.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.238
No water to drink,

00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:07.966
except coming out of a spigot
connected to the toilet.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.710
The water looked and tasted dirty,

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:11.249
there was never enough food,

00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:12.821
never any showers,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.635
women menstruating
without any hygiene products,

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.353
no medical attention whatsoever.

00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:19.557
When I asked a woman
about medical attention,

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:21.976
she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.145
The only attention you get
from the guards in there is sexual."

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:28.558
So, they'd take the debtors
to this place and they'd say,

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:32.118
"We're not letting you leave
until you make a payment on your debt."

00:05:32.142 --> 00:05:34.772
And if you could -- if you
could call a family member

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:36.937
who could somehow come up with some money,

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.354
then maybe you were out.

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:40.537
If it was enough money, you were out.

00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.879
But if it wasn't, you'd stay there
for days or weeks,

00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:46.689
and every day the guards
would come down to the cells

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:50.100
and haggle with the debtors
about the price of release that day.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:54.747
You'd stay until, at some point,
the jail would be booked to capacity,

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.721
and they'd want to book someone new in.

00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:58.306
And at that point, they'd think,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.085
"OK, it's unlikely this person
can come up with the money,

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:02.969
it's more likely this new person will."

00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:05.971
You're out, they're in,
and the machine kept moving like that.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:08.021
I met a man who,

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:12.312
nine years ago, was arrested
for panhandling in a Walgreens.

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:16.392
He couldn't afford his fines
and his court fees from that case.

00:06:16.416 --> 00:06:19.412
When he was young
he survived a house fire,

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:22.409
only because he jumped out
of the third-story window to escape.

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.634
But that fall left him
with damage to his brain

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:27.093
and several parts of this body,
including his leg.

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:28.276
So he can't work,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.802
and he relies on social security
payments to survive.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:32.512
When I met him in his apartment,

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.415
he had nothing of value there --
not even food in his fridge.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.604
He's chronically hungry.

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:40.107
He had nothing of value in his apartment
except a small piece of cardboard

00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.369
on which he'd written
the names of his children.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.961
He cherished this a lot.
He was happy to show it to me.

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.141
But he can't pay his fines and fees
because he has nothing to give.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:51.541
In the last nine years,
he's been arrested 13 times,

00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:55.896
and jailed for a total of 130 days
on that panhandling case.

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.707
One of those stretches lasted 45 days.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:04.137
Just imagine spending from right now
until sometime in June

00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.957
in the place that I described to you
a few moments ago.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.697
He told me about all the suicide attempts
he's seen in Ferguson's jail;

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:14.994
about the time a man found
a way to hang himself

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.678
out of reach of the other inmates,

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.864
so all they could do
was yell and yell and yell,

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:21.628
trying to get the guards' attention

00:07:21.652 --> 00:07:23.645
so they could come down and cut him down.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.105
And he told me that it took the guards
over five minutes to respond,

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:29.397
and when they came,
the man was unconscious.

00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:32.592
So they called the paramedics
and the paramedics went to the cell.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:33.948
They said, "He'll be OK,"

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:36.176
so they just left him there on the floor.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.494
I heard many stories like this
and they shouldn't have surprised me,

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:43.070
because suicide is the single leading
cause of death in our local jails.

00:07:43.852 --> 00:07:46.839
This is related to the lack
of mental health care in our jails.

00:07:46.863 --> 00:07:50.783
I met a woman, single mother of three,
making seven dollars an hour.

00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:53.599
She relies on food stamps
to feed herself and her children.

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:55.652
About a decade ago,

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:59.441
she got a couple of traffic tickets
and a minor theft charge,

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.233
and she can't afford her fines
and fees on those cases.

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:06.226
Since then, she's been jailed
about 10 times on those cases,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.533
but she has schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder,

00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:10.708
and she needs medication every day.

00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:13.770
She doesn't have access
to those medications in Ferguson's jail,

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:16.010
because no one has access
to their medications.

00:08:16.034 --> 00:08:20.060
She told me about what it was like
to spend two weeks in a cage,

00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:23.637
hallucinating people and shadows
and hearing voices,

00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.255
begging for the medication
that would make it all stop,

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:27.649
only to be ignored.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.216
And this isn't anomalous, either:

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.765
thirty percent of women in our local jails
have serious mental health needs

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.945
just like hers,

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:39.486
but only one in six receives
any mental health care while in jail.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.335
And so, I heard all these stories
about this grotesque dungeon

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:45.557
that Ferguson was operating
for its debtors,

00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:47.874
and when it came time
for me to actually see it

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:49.852
and to go visit Ferguson's jail,

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:51.916
I'm not sure what I was expecting to see,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.894
but I wasn't expecting this.

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.334
It's an ordinary government building.

00:08:56.358 --> 00:08:58.814
It could be a post office or a school.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:02.530
It reminded me that these illegal
extortion schemes

00:09:02.554 --> 00:09:04.642
aren't being run somewhere in the shadows,

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:07.382
they're being run out in the open
by our public officials.

00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:09.106
They're a matter of public policy.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.969
And this reminded me
that poverty jailing in general,

00:09:11.993 --> 00:09:14.201
even outside the debtors' prison context,

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:17.146
plays a very visible and central role
in our justice system.

00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:20.030
What I have in mind is our policy of bail.

00:09:20.054 --> 00:09:22.606
In our system, whether
you're detained or free,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.760
pending trial is not a matter
of how dangerous you are

00:09:25.784 --> 00:09:28.032
or how much of a flight risk you pose.

00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:31.142
It's a matter of whether you can afford
to post your bail amount.

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:33.878
So Bill Cosby, whose bail
was set at a million dollars,

00:09:33.902 --> 00:09:37.362
immediately writes the check,
and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:39.118
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,

00:09:39.142 --> 00:09:43.140
was only there because her family
was unable to come up with 500 dollars.

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:46.551
In fact, there are half a million
Sandra Blands across the country --

00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:48.841
500,000 people who are in jail right now,

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.526
only because they can't afford
their bail amount.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.607
We're told that our jails
are places for criminals,

00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.644
but statistically that's not the case:

00:09:56.668 --> 00:10:00.969
three out of every five people
in jail right now are there pretrial.

00:10:00.993 --> 00:10:03.175
They haven't been convicted of any crime;

00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:05.710
they haven't pled guilty to any offense.

00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:07.695
Right here in San Francisco,

00:10:07.719 --> 00:10:11.109
85 percent of the inmates
in our jail in San Francisco

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:12.877
are pretrial detainees.

00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:16.286
This means San Francisco is spending
something like 80 million dollars

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.480
every year

00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:19.220
to fund pretrial detention.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.659
Many of these people who are in jail
only because they can't post bail

00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:27.929
are facing allegations so minor

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:31.336
that the amount of time it would take
for them to sit waiting for trial

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.412
is longer than the sentence
they would receive if convicted,

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:36.704
which means they're guaranteed
to get out faster

00:10:36.728 --> 00:10:38.012
if they just plead guilty.

00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:39.595
So now the choice is:

00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:42.492
Should I stay here in this horrible place,

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:44.626
away from my family and my dependents,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.127
almost guaranteed to lose my job,

00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:48.772
and then fight the charges?

00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:52.365
Or should I just plead guilty to whatever
the prosecutor wants and get out?

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:55.324
And at this point, they're pretrial
detainees, not criminals.

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:58.240
But once they take that plea deal,
we'll call them criminals,

00:10:58.264 --> 00:11:01.644
even though an affluent person
would never have been in this situation,

00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:04.542
because an affluent person
would have simply been bailed out.

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.656
At this point you might be wondering,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.474
"This guy's in the inspiration section,
what is he doing --

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:10.658
(Laughter)

00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:13.488
"This is extremely depressing.
I want my money back."

00:11:13.512 --> 00:11:14.718
(Laughter)

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:17.141
But in actuality,

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:21.555
I find talking about jailing much less
depressing than the alternative,

00:11:21.579 --> 00:11:24.015
because I think if we don't talk
about these issues

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.440
and collectively change
how we think about jailing,

00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:27.968
at the end of all of our lives,

00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:31.123
we'll still have jails full of poor people
who don't belong there.

00:11:31.147 --> 00:11:32.701
That really is depressing to me.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.149
But what's exciting to me is the thought
that these stories can move us

00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:38.216
to think about jailing in different terms.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.611
Not in sterile policy terms
like "mass incarceration,"

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:43.621
or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"

00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:44.811
but in human terms.

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:49.420
When we put a human being in a cage
for days or weeks or months

00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:50.888
or even years,

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:53.261
what are we doing
to that person's mind and body?

00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:56.043
Under what conditions
are we really willing to do that?

00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:59.375
And so if starting with a few
hundred of us in this room,

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.443
we can commit to thinking about
jailing in this different light,

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:05.947
then we can undo that normalization
I was referring to earlier.

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:09.009
If I leave you with anything today,
I hope it's with the thought

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:11.465
that if we want anything
to fundamentally change --

00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:14.769
not just to reform our policies
on bail and fines and fees --

00:12:14.793 --> 00:12:17.846
but also to make sure that whatever
new policies replace those

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.921
don't punish the poor and the marginalized
in their own new way.

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:22.577
If we want that kind of change,

00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:25.126
then this shift in thinking
is required of each of us.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.334
Thank you.

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:30.028
(Applause)
