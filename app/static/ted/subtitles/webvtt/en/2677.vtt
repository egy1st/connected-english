00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:04.603
So many of you have probably seen
the movie "The Martian."

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:08.958
But for those of you who did not,
it's a movie about an astronaut

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:13.525
who is stranded on Mars,
and his efforts to stay alive

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.045
until the Earth can send a rescue mission
to bring him back to Earth.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.344
Gladly, they do re-establish communication

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:24.906
with the character,
astronaut Watney, at some point

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.201
so that he's not as alone
on Mars until he can be rescued.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:33.488
So while you're watching the movie,
or even if you haven't,

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.060
when you think about Mars,

00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:39.884
you're probably thinking about
how far away it is and how distant.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:42.487
And, what might not
have occurred to you is,

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:46.408
what are the logistics really like
of working on another planet --

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:48.678
of living on two planets

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:54.536
when there are people on the Earth
and there are rovers or people on Mars?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.718
So think about when you have friends,
families and co-workers

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.900
in California, on the West Coast
or in other parts of the world.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.278
When you're trying
to communicate with them,

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:06.740
one of the things
you probably first think about is:

00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.860
wait, what time is it in California?

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:11.479
Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:15.234
So even if you're interacting
with colleagues who are in Europe,

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.300
you're immediately thinking about:

00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:24.324
What does it take to coordinate
communication when people are far away?

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:30.557
So we don't have people on Mars
right now, but we do have rovers.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:35.686
And actually right now, on Curiosity,
it is 6:10 in the morning.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.481
So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.

00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:40.877
We have four rovers on Mars.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.908
The United States has put four rovers
on Mars since the mid-1990s,

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.871
and I have been privileged enough
to work on three of them.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:53.416
So, I am a spacecraft engineer,
a spacecraft operations engineer,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.287
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Los Angeles, California.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.017
And these rovers
are our robotic emissaries.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:09.319
So, they are our eyes and our ears,
and they see the planet for us

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:11.176
until we can send people.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.493
So we learn how to operate
on other planets through these rovers.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:20.823
So before we send people, we send robots.

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:25.277
So the reason there's a time difference
on Mars right now,

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:26.603
from the time that we're at

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:30.601
is because the Martian day
is longer than the Earth day.

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:33.751
Our Earth day is 24 hours,

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:37.149
because that's how long it takes
the Earth to rotate,

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.174
how long it takes to go around once.

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.110
So our day is 24 hours.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:48.306
It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately
40 minutes to rotate once.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.748
So that means that the Martian day
is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:03:00.362
So teams of people who are operating
the rovers on Mars, like this one,

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:05.798
what we are doing is we are living
on Earth, but working on Mars.

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:11.287
So we have to think as if we are actually
on Mars with the rover.

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:15.233
Our job, the job of this team,
of which I'm a part of,

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:21.186
is to send commands to the rover
to tell it what to do the next day.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.239
To tell it to drive or drill
or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:30.019
So while she's sleeping --
and the rover does sleep at night

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.413
because she needs
to recharge her batteries

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:36.333
and she needs to weather
the cold Martian night.

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:37.719
And so she sleeps.

00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:42.511
So while she sleeps, we work
on her program for the next day.

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:45.839
So I work the Martian night shift.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:47.454
(Laughter)

00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:54.106
So in order to come to work on the Earth
at the same time every day on Mars --

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.534
like, let's say I need to be
at work at 5:00 p.m.,

00:03:56.558 --> 00:04:02.127
this team needs to be at work
at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:09.151
then we have to come to work
on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,

00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:12.321
in order to stay in sync with Mars.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:15.297
That's like moving a time zone every day.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:20.776
So one day you come in at 8:00,
the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.069
the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:25.682
the next day at 10:00.

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:29.284
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:32.297
until soon you're coming to work
in the middle of the night --

00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.138
the middle of the Earth night.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:37.780
Right? So you can imagine
how confusing that is.

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:39.956
Hence, the Mars watch.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.981
(Laughter)

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.523
This weights in this watch
have been mechanically adjusted

00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:47.075
so that it runs more slowly.

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.988
Right? And we didn't start out --

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.238
I got this watch in 2004

00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:54.566
when Spirit and Opportunity,
the rovers back then.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.196
We didn't start out thinking

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.651
that we were going to need Mars watches.

00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:03.106
Right? We thought, OK,
we'll just have the time on our computers

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.778
and on the mission control screens,
and that would be enough.

00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:08.183
Yeah, not so much.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:11.056
Because we weren't just
working on Mars time,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.239
we were actually living on Mars time.

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:18.546
And we got just instantaneously confused
about what time it was.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.363
So you really needed something
on your wrist to tell you:

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:25.678
What time is it on the Earth?
What time is it on Mars?

00:05:26.107 --> 00:05:32.001
And it wasn't just the time on Mars
that was confusing;

00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:36.794
we also needed to be able
to talk to each other about it.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:42.964
So a "sol" is a Martian day --
again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:46.183
So when we're talking about something
that's happening on the Earth,

00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:47.516
we will say, today.

00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:51.060
So, for Mars, we say, "tosol."

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.922
(Laughter)

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:58.509
Yesterday became "yestersol" for Mars.

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:03.344
Again, we didn't start out thinking,
"Oh, let's invent a language."

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.658
It was just very confusing.

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:06.863
I remember somebody
walked up to me and said,

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:10.320
"I would like to do this activity
on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."

00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:15.455
And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow,
or Mars, tomorrow?"

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:21.039
We started this terminology because
we needed a way to talk to each other.

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:22.191
(Laughter)

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.491
Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:30.831
Because people have different preferences
for the words they use.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:34.231
Some of you might say "soda"
and some of you might say "pop."

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:38.035
So we have people who say
"nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:43.286
And then something that I noticed after
a few years of working on these missions,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.962
was that the people who work
on the rovers, we say "tosol."

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:51.960
The people who work on the
landed missions that don't rove around,

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:53.456
they say "tosoul."

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.677
So I could actually tell what mission
you worked on from your Martian accent.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.951
(Laughter)

00:07:01.975 --> 00:07:05.835
So we have the watches and the language,
and you're detecting a theme here, right?

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.855
So that we don't get confused.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.226
But even the Earth daylight
could confuse us.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.008
If you think that right now,
you've come to work

00:07:15.032 --> 00:07:17.127
and it's the middle of the Martian night

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.449
and there's light streaming in
from the windows

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.621
that's going to be confusing as well.

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.586
So you can see from
this image of the control room

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.879
that all of the blinds are down.

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.906
So that there's no light to distract us.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.282
The blinds went down all over the building
about a week before landing,

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:38.573
and they didn't go up
until we went off Mars time.

00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:42.208
So this also works
for the house, for at home.

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:45.005
I've been on Mars time three times,
and my husband is like,

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.844
OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.

00:07:46.868 --> 00:07:53.070
And so he'll put foil all over the windows
and dark curtains and shades

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:56.241
because it also affects your families.

00:07:56.265 --> 00:08:01.144
And so here I was living in kind of
this darkened environment, but so was he.

00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:03.001
And he'd gotten used to it.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.667
But then I would get these plaintive
emails from him when he was at work.

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:10.549
Should I come home? Are you awake?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.703
What time is it on Mars?

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:16.225
And I decided, OK,
so he needs a Mars watch.

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:17.784
(Laughter)

00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:22.242
But of course, it's 2016,
so there's an app for that.

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:23.544
(Laughter)

00:08:23.568 --> 00:08:28.182
So now instead of the watches,
we can also use our phones.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.740
But the impact on families
was just across the board;

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.426
it wasn't just those of us
who were working on the rovers

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.664
but our families as well.

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:41.167
This is David Oh,
one of our flight directors,

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:45.665
and he's at the beach in Los Angeles
with his family at 1:00 in the morning.

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:47.112
(Laughter)

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:50.116
So because we landed in August

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.586
and his kids didn't have to go back
to school until September,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.358
they actually went on to Mars time
with him for one month.

00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:04.151
They got up 40 minutes later every day.

00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:06.358
And they were on dad's work schedule.

00:09:06.382 --> 00:09:10.357
So they lived on Mars time for a month
and had these great adventures,

00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:12.478
like going bowling
in the middle of the night

00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:13.820
or going to the beach.

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:17.508
And one of the things
that we all discovered

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:21.520
is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles

00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:25.097
at 3:00 in the morning
when there's no traffic.

00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:26.595
(Laughter)

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:27.811
So we would get off work,

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:30.950
and we didn't want to go home
and bother our families,

00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:34.164
and we were hungry, so instead of
going locally to eat something,

00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:37.752
we'd go, "Wait, there's this great
all-night deli in Long Beach,

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:40.018
and we can get there in 10 minutes!"

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.763
So we would drive down --
it was like the 60s, no traffic.

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:46.542
We would drive down there,
and the restaurant owners would go,

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:48.728
"Who are you people?

00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:53.594
And why are you at my restaurant
at 3:00 in the morning?"

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:58.848
So they came to realize
that there were these packs of Martians,

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:04.326
roaming the LA freeways,
in the middle of the night --

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:07.311
in the middle of the Earth night.

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:12.132
And we did actually
start calling ourselves Martians.

00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:18.187
So those of us who were on Mars time
would refer to ourselves as Martians,

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.064
and everyone else as Earthlings.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:22.388
(Laughter)

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:28.107
And that's because when you're moving
a time-zone every day,

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:33.944
you start to really feel separated
from everyone else.

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:37.887
You're literally in your own world.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:45.629
So I have this button on that says,
"I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:48.398
And there's a picture of it
up on the screen.

00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:54.051
So the reason we got these buttons
is because we work on Mars time

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:59.124
in order to be as efficient as possible
with the rover on Mars,

00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:01.438
to make the best use of our time.

00:11:01.462 --> 00:11:05.348
But we don't stay on Mars time
for more than three to four months.

00:11:05.372 --> 00:11:09.640
Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars
time, which is what we're working now.

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:15.036
And that's because it's hard on
your bodies, it's hard on your families.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.942
In fact, there were sleep researchers
who actually were studying us

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:25.003
because it was so unusual for humans
to try to extend their day.

00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:26.617
And they had about 30 of us

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.267
that they would do
sleep deprivation experiments on.

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:33.854
So I would come in and take the test
and I fell asleep in each one.

00:11:33.878 --> 00:11:40.520
And that was because, again,
this eventually becomes hard on your body.

00:11:40.544 --> 00:11:43.859
Even though it was a blast.

00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:48.397
It was a huge bonding experience
with the other members on the team,

00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:51.261
but it is difficult to sustain.

00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:58.428
So these rover missions are our first
steps out into the solar system.

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:03.525
We are learning how to live
on more than one planet.

00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:08.625
We are changing our perspective
to become multi-planetary.

00:12:08.943 --> 00:12:11.738
So the next time you see
a Star Wars movie,

00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:15.437
and there are people going
from the Dagobah system to Tatooine,

00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:20.951
think about what it really means to have
people spread out so far.

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:24.037
What it means in terms
of the distances between them,

00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:27.881
how they will start to feel
separate from each other

00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:31.129
and just the logistics of the time.

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:36.489
We have not sent people
to Mars yet, but we hope to.

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:40.352
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:43.865
and all of the international
space agencies of the world,

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:47.656
we hope to do that
in the next few decades.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.505
So soon we will have people on Mars,
and we truly will be multi-planetary.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.412
And the young boy or the young girl

00:12:56.436 --> 00:13:03.436
who will be going to Mars could be
in this audience or listening today.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:09.803
I have wanted to work at JPL
on these missions since I was 14 years old

00:13:09.827 --> 00:13:12.049
and I am privileged to be a part of it.

00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:16.127
And this is a remarkable time
in the space program,

00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:19.325
and we are all in this journey together.

00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:24.560
So the next time you think
you don't have enough time in your day,

00:13:24.584 --> 00:13:29.362
just remember, it's all a matter
of your Earthly perspective.

00:13:29.386 --> 00:13:30.537
Thank you.

00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:34.675
(Applause)
