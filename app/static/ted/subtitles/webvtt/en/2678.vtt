[This talk contains graphic language
and descriptions of sexual violence

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:04.869
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:07.849
Tom Stranger: In 1996,
when I was 18 years old,

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.480
I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program.

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:15.792
Ironically I'm an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather,

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:20.675
so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.922
after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.908
I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.333
who took me hiking,

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:32.448
and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language.

00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:36.201
I struggled a bit with the initial
period of homesickness.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.223
I snowboarded after school,

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:39.610
and I slept a lot.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.418
Two hours of chemistry class in a language
that you don't yet fully understand

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:46.224
can be a pretty good sedative.

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:47.398
(Laughter)

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:51.160
My teacher recommended
I try out for the school play,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.514
just to get me a bit more socially active.

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:56.595
It turns out I didn't end up
being part of the play,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.526
but through it I met Thordis.

00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:01.514
We shared a lovely teenage romance,

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:04.032
and we'd meet at lunchtimes
to just hold hands

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:06.202
and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.917
I met her welcoming family,
and she met my friends.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:13.449
We'd been in a budding relationship
for a bit over a month

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.720
when our school's Christmas Ball was held.

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:21.336
Thordis Elva: I was 16
and in love for the first time.

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:23.594
Going together to the Christmas dance

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:26.415
was a public confirmation
of our relationship,

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.406
and I felt like the luckiest
girl in the world.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.007
No longer a child, but a young woman.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.643
High on my newfound maturity,

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:39.027
I felt it was only natural to try drinking
rum for the first time that night, too.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.558
That was a bad idea.

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:43.070
I became very ill,

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:44.914
drifting in and out of consciousness

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:48.063
in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:51.051
The security guards wanted
to call me an ambulance,

00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:54.064
but Tom acted as my knight
in shining armor,

00:01:54.088 --> 00:01:56.123
and told them he'd take me home.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.483
It was like a fairy tale,

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:00.283
his strong arms around me,

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:02.598
laying me in the safety of my bed.

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:08.129
But the gratitude that I felt
towards him soon turned to horror

00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:12.611
as he proceeded to take off my clothes
and get on top of me.

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:14.793
My head had cleared up,

00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:17.944
but my body was still
too weak to fight back,

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:20.302
and the pain was blinding.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.848
I thought I'd be severed in two.

00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:25.379
In order to stay sane,

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:28.677
I silently counted the seconds
on my alarm clock.

00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:31.357
And ever since that night,

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:37.155
I've known that there are 7,200
seconds in two hours.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.378
Despite limping for days
and crying for weeks,

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:46.808
this incident didn't fit my ideas
about rape like I'd seen on TV.

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.382
Tom wasn't an armed lunatic;

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:51.169
he was my boyfriend.

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:53.802
And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:55.887
it happened in my own bed.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.352
By the time I could identify
what had happened to me as rape,

00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:02.367
he had completed his exchange program

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:03.946
and left for Australia.

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:08.175
So I told myself it was pointless
to address what had happened.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.384
And besides,

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:12.003
it had to have been my fault, somehow.

00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:14.990
I was raised in a world
where girls are taught

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:17.176
that they get raped for a reason.

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:20.349
Their skirt was too short,

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:22.867
their smile was too wide,

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:25.309
their breath smelled of alcohol.

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:28.783
And I was guilty of all of those things,

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:30.857
so the shame had to be mine.

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.099
It took me years to realize

00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:37.034
that only one thing could have stopped me
from being raped that night,

00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:39.200
and it wasn't my skirt,

00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:41.174
it wasn't my smile,

00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:43.394
it wasn't my childish trust.

00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:47.566
The only thing that could've stopped me
from being raped that night

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.640
is the man who raped me --

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.677
had he stopped himself.

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.840
TS: I have vague memories of the next day:

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:58.030
the after effects of drinking,

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.843
a certain hollowness
that I tried to stifle.

00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:02.845
Nothing more.

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.036
But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.215
It is important to now state

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.739
that I didn't see my deed for what it was.

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:15.706
The word "rape" didn't echo
around my mind as it should've,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.934
and I wasn't crucifying myself
with memories of the night before.

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:23.898
It wasn't so much a conscious refusal,

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:27.281
it was more like any acknowledgment
of reality was forbidden.

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:32.479
My definition of my actions completely
refuted any recognition

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:34.780
of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.

00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:37.857
To be honest,

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:41.975
I repudiated the entire act
in the days afterwards

00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:44.278
and when I was committing it.

00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:49.952
I disavowed the truth by convincing
myself it was sex and not rape.

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:54.654
And this is a lie I've felt
spine-bending guilt for.

00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:58.421
I broke up with Thordis
a couple of days later,

00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:00.089
and then saw her a number of times

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:02.171
during the remainder
of my year in Iceland,

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:05.088
feeling a sharp stab
of heavyheartedness each time.

00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:10.276
Deep down, I knew I'd done
something immeasurably wrong.

00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:14.349
But without planning it,
I sunk the memories deep,

00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:16.154
and then I tied a rock to them.

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:19.961
What followed is a nine-year period

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:23.123
that can best be titled
as "Denial and Running."

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.489
When I got a chance to identify
the real torment that I caused,

00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:30.756
I didn't stand still long enough to do so.

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:34.159
Whether it be via distraction,

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:35.659
substance use,

00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:37.301
thrill-seeking

00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:40.674
or the scrupulous policing
of my inner speak,

00:05:40.698 --> 00:05:42.967
I refused to be static and silent.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.387
And with this noise,

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:49.380
I also drew heavily
upon other parts of my life

00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:51.575
to construct a picture of who I was.

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:53.866
I was a surfer,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.607
a social science student,

00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.717
a friend to good people,

00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:59.999
a loved brother and son,

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:01.575
an outdoor recreation guide,

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.162
and eventually, a youth worker.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.121
I gripped tight to the simple notion
that I wasn't a bad person.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.540
I didn't think I had this in my bones.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.199
I thought I was made up of something else.

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.168
In my nurtured upbringing,

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:18.538
my loving extended family and role models,

00:06:19.586 --> 00:06:21.521
people close to me were warm and genuine

00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:23.440
in their respect shown towards women.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:29.543
It took me a long time to stare down
this dark corner of myself,

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.201
and to ask it questions.

00:06:34.231 --> 00:06:36.206
TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.711
I was 25 years old,

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:40.302
and headed straight
for a nervous breakdown.

00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:44.722
My self-worth was buried
under a soul-crushing load of silence

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:48.038
that isolated me from everyone
that I cared about,

00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:50.967
and I was consumed
with misplaced hatred and anger

00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:52.755
that I took out on myself.

00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:56.245
One day, I stormed out
of the door in tears

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.212
after a fight with a loved one,

00:06:58.236 --> 00:06:59.935
and I wandered into a café,

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.041
where I asked the waitress for a pen.

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:04.494
I always had a notebook with me,

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:08.251
claiming that it was to jot down ideas
in moments of inspiration,

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:12.505
but the truth was that I needed
to be constantly fidgeting,

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.416
because in moments of stillness,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.085
I found myself counting seconds again.

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:23.080
But that day, I watched in wonder
as the words streamed out of my pen,

00:07:23.104 --> 00:07:26.165
forming the most pivotal letter
I've ever written,

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.723
addressed to Tom.

00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:31.835
Along with an account of the violence
that he subjected me to,

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:35.042
the words, "I want to find forgiveness"

00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:36.550
stared back at me,

00:07:36.574 --> 00:07:38.989
surprising nobody more than myself.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.266
But deep down I realized that this
was my way out of my suffering,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.327
because regardless of whether or not
he deserved my forgiveness,

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.837
I deserved peace.

00:07:51.347 --> 00:07:54.347
My era of shame was over.

00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:57.671
Before sending the letter,

00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:00.442
I prepared myself for all kinds
of negative responses,

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:04.213
or what I found likeliest:
no response whatsoever.

00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:07.963
The only outcome
that I didn't prepare myself for

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.216
was the one that I then got --

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.151
a typed confession from Tom,
full of disarming regret.

00:08:15.618 --> 00:08:19.705
As it turns out, he, too,
had been imprisoned by silence.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:24.404
And this marked the start
of an eight-year-long correspondence

00:08:24.428 --> 00:08:26.852
that God knows was never easy,

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.044
but always honest.

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:33.304
I relieved myself of the burdens
that I'd wrongfully shouldered,

00:08:33.328 --> 00:08:36.736
and he, in turn, wholeheartedly
owned up to what he'd done.

00:08:37.415 --> 00:08:39.687
Our written exchanges became a platform

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:42.428
to dissect the consequences of that night,

00:08:42.452 --> 00:08:44.647
and they were everything
from gut-wrenching

00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:47.225
to healing beyond words.

00:08:47.613 --> 00:08:51.549
And yet, it didn't bring about
closure for me.

00:08:52.358 --> 00:08:55.840
Perhaps because the email format
didn't feel personal enough,

00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:57.775
perhaps because it's easy to be brave

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:01.907
when you're hiding behind a computer
screen on the other side of the planet.

00:09:01.931 --> 00:09:03.717
But we'd begun a dialogue

00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:07.507
that I felt was necessary
to explore to its fullest.

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:10.137
So, after eight years of writing,

00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:13.867
and nearly 16 years after that dire night,

00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:17.722
I mustered the courage
to propose a wild idea:

00:09:17.746 --> 00:09:19.406
that we'd meet up in person

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.261
and face our past once and for all.

00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.364
TS: Iceland and Australia
are geographically like this.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.497
In the middle of the two is South Africa.

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.951
We decided upon the city of Cape Town,

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.019
and there we met for one week.

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:41.896
The city itself proved to be
a stunningly powerful environment

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.804
to focus on reconciliation
and forgiveness.

00:09:45.847 --> 00:09:48.486
Nowhere else has healing
and rapprochement been tested

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.144
like it has in South Africa.

00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:54.903
As a nation, South Africa sought
to sit within the truth of its past,

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:57.330
and to listen to the details
of its history.

00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:02.568
Knowing this only magnified the effect
that Cape Town had on us.

00:10:04.006 --> 00:10:05.468
Over the course of this week,

00:10:05.492 --> 00:10:08.382
we literally spoke
our life stories to each other,

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:09.996
from start to finish.

00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:13.805
And this was about analyzing
our own history.

00:10:15.568 --> 00:10:18.401
We followed a strict policy
of being honest,

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:21.350
and this also came
with a certain exposure,

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:23.280
an open-chested vulnerability.

00:10:24.312 --> 00:10:26.439
There were gutting confessions,

00:10:26.463 --> 00:10:29.287
and moments where we just
absolutely couldn't fathom

00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:31.119
the other person's experience.

00:10:32.258 --> 00:10:37.152
The seismic effects of sexual violence
were spoken aloud and felt,

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:38.506
face to face.

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:41.482
At other times, though,

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:44.140
we found a soaring clarity,

00:10:45.164 --> 00:10:49.564
and even some totally unexpected
but liberating laughter.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.780
When it came down to it,

00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:56.432
we did out best to listen
to each other intently.

00:10:57.404 --> 00:11:03.245
And our individual realities
were aired with an unfiltered purity

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:05.645
that couldn't do any less
than lighten the soul.

00:11:08.508 --> 00:11:12.553
TE: Wanting to take revenge
is a very human emotion --

00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:14.215
instinctual, even.

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:16.840
And all I wanted to do for years

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:20.833
was to hurt Tom back as deeply
as he had hurt me.

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.711
But had I not found a way
out of the hatred and anger,

00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:26.900
I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.

00:11:28.058 --> 00:11:31.985
That isn't to say that I didn't have
my doubts along the way.

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:36.350
When the plane bounced
on that landing strip in Cape Town,

00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:37.977
I remember thinking,

00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:42.207
"Why did I not just get myself
a therapist and a bottle of vodka

00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:44.447
like a normal person would do?"

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:47.391
(Laughter)

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.620
At times, our search
for understanding in Cape Town

00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.811
felt like an impossible quest,

00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:54.934
and all I wanted to do was to give up

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.174
and go home to my loving
husband, Vidir,

00:11:57.198 --> 00:11:58.409
and our son.

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:02.357
But despite our difficulties,

00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:07.009
this journey did result
in a victorious feeling

00:12:07.033 --> 00:12:10.166
that light had triumphed over darkness,

00:12:10.812 --> 00:12:15.124
that something constructive
could be built out of the ruins.

00:12:16.572 --> 00:12:17.897
I read somewhere

00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:21.782
that you should try and be the person
that you needed when you were younger.

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.390
And back when I was a teenager,

00:12:23.414 --> 00:12:27.262
I would have needed to know
that the shame wasn't mine,

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:29.800
that there's hope after rape,

00:12:29.824 --> 00:12:31.419
that you can even find happiness,

00:12:31.443 --> 00:12:33.333
like I share with my husband today.

00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:38.216
Which is why I started writing feverishly
upon my return from Cape Town,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.964
resulting in a book co-authored by Tom,

00:12:40.988 --> 00:12:44.173
that we hope can be of use
to people from both ends

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.501
of the perpetrator-survivor scale.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.634
If nothing else,

00:12:48.658 --> 00:12:52.793
it's a story that we would've needed
to hear when we were younger.

00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:56.547
Given the nature of our story,

00:12:56.571 --> 00:12:59.347
I know the words
that inevitably accompany it --

00:12:59.933 --> 00:13:02.489
victim, rapist --

00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:04.768
and labels are a way to organize concepts,

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:09.174
but they can also be dehumanizing
in their connotations.

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:11.938
Once someone's been deemed a victim,

00:13:11.962 --> 00:13:17.195
it's that much easier to file them away
as someone damaged,

00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:18.725
dishonored,

00:13:18.749 --> 00:13:20.024
less than.

00:13:20.643 --> 00:13:23.363
And likewise, once someone
has been branded a rapist,

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:25.933
it's that much easier
to call him a monster --

00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:27.875
inhuman.

00:13:28.614 --> 00:13:31.645
But how will we understand
what it is in human societies

00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:33.250
that produces violence

00:13:33.274 --> 00:13:37.753
if we refuse to recognize
the humanity of those who commit it?

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:39.698
And how --

00:13:39.722 --> 00:13:41.901
(Applause)

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:47.293
And how can we empower survivors
if we're making them feel less than?

00:13:48.072 --> 00:13:51.499
How can we discuss solutions
to one of the biggest threats

00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:54.797
to the lives of women and children
around the world,

00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.644
if the very words we use
are part of the problem?

00:14:01.786 --> 00:14:04.278
TS: From what I've now learnt,

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:08.875
my actions that night in 1996
were a self-centered taking.

00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:12.151
I felt deserving of Thordis's body.

00:14:13.743 --> 00:14:16.608
I've had primarily positive
social influences

00:14:16.632 --> 00:14:19.173
and examples of equitable
behavior around me.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.027
But on that occasion,

00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:23.155
I chose to draw upon the negative ones.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:26.612
The ones that see women
as having less intrinsic worth,

00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:32.098
and of men having some unspoken
and symbolic claim to their bodies.

00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:36.790
These influences I speak of
are external to me, though.

00:14:37.582 --> 00:14:40.363
And it was only me in that room
making choices,

00:14:40.387 --> 00:14:41.615
nobody else.

00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:44.754
When you own something

00:14:44.778 --> 00:14:47.396
and really square up to your culpability,

00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:50.582
I do think a surprising thing can happen.

00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:53.556
It's what I call a paradox of ownership.

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.781
I thought I'd buckle
under the weight of responsibility.

00:14:58.377 --> 00:15:01.260
I thought my certificate
of humanity would be burnt.

00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:06.222
Instead, I was offered
to really own what I did,

00:15:07.148 --> 00:15:10.408
and found that it didn't possess
the entirety of who I am.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.821
Put simply,

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:17.361
something you've done doesn't have
to constitute the sum of who you are.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:20.317
The noise in my head abated.

00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:24.979
The indulgent self-pity
was starved of oxygen,

00:15:25.003 --> 00:15:29.476
and it was replaced
with the clean air of acceptance --

00:15:30.658 --> 00:15:34.942
an acceptance that I did hurt
this wonderful person standing next to me;

00:15:34.966 --> 00:15:40.565
an acceptance that I am part of a large
and shockingly everyday grouping of men

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:43.271
who have been sexually violent
toward their partners.

00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:47.340
Don't underestimate the power of words.

00:15:48.372 --> 00:15:53.013
Saying to Thordis that I raped her
changed my accord with myself,

00:15:53.037 --> 00:15:54.297
as well as with her.

00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:56.989
But most importantly,

00:15:57.013 --> 00:16:00.089
the blame transferred from Thordis to me.

00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:02.482
Far too often,

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:07.090
the responsibility is attributed
to female survivors of sexual violence,

00:16:07.114 --> 00:16:09.625
and not to the males who enact it.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:11.886
Far too often,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.992
the denial and running leaves all parties
at a great distance from the truth.

00:16:18.984 --> 00:16:21.764
There's definitely a public
conversation happening now,

00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:24.550
and like a lot of people,

00:16:24.574 --> 00:16:27.164
we're heartened
that there's less retreating

00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:29.908
from this difficult
but important discussion.

00:16:31.028 --> 00:16:34.666
I feel a real responsibility
to add our voices to it.

00:16:38.072 --> 00:16:42.731
TE: What we did is not a formula
that we're prescribing for others.

00:16:43.182 --> 00:16:48.715
Nobody has the right to tell anyone else
how to handle their deepest pain

00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:50.484
or their greatest error.

00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:53.687
Breaking your silence is never easy,

00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:55.925
and depending on where
you are in the world,

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:59.161
it can even be deadly
to speak out about rape.

00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:04.154
I realize that even the most
traumatic event of my life

00:17:04.178 --> 00:17:06.937
is still a testament to my privilege,

00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:10.191
because I can talk about it
without getting ostracized,

00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:11.563
or even killed.

00:17:12.293 --> 00:17:15.222
But with that privilege of having a voice

00:17:15.246 --> 00:17:18.104
comes the responsibility of using it.

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:23.263
That's the least I owe
my fellow survivors who can't.

00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:27.907
The story we've just relayed is unique,

00:17:27.931 --> 00:17:32.597
and yet it is so common with sexual
violence being a global pandemic.

00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:35.026
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:38.757
One of the things that I found useful
on my own healing journey

00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:41.429
is educating myself about sexual violence.

00:17:41.453 --> 00:17:43.867
And as a result,
I've been reading, writing

00:17:43.891 --> 00:17:46.544
and speaking about this issue
for over a decade now,

00:17:46.568 --> 00:17:49.120
going to conferences around the world.

00:17:49.144 --> 00:17:51.123
And in my experience,

00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:55.778
the attendees of such events
are almost exclusively women.

00:17:57.013 --> 00:18:03.629
But it's about time that we stop treating
sexual violence as a women's issue.

00:18:03.653 --> 00:18:09.100
(Applause)

00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:21.113
A majority of sexual violence
against women and men

00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:23.020
is perpetrated by men.

00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:27.452
And yet their voices are sorely
underrepresented in this discussion.

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:32.743
But all of us are needed here.

00:18:33.744 --> 00:18:37.629
Just imagine all the suffering
we could alleviate

00:18:37.653 --> 00:18:41.587
if we dared to face this issue together.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.038
Thank you.

00:18:44.062 --> 00:18:48.329
(Applause)
