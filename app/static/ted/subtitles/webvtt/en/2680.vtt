00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.840
"You have cancer."

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.120
Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear
those three words within our lifetime,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.960
and half will not survive.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.816
This means that two out of five
of your closest friends and relatives

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.296
will be diagnosed
with some form of cancer,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.800
and one will die.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.736
Beyond the physical hardships,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.936
roughly one-third
of cancer survivors here in the US

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.696
will go into debt from treatment.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.456
And they're at least two and a half times
more likely to declare bankruptcy

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.720
than those without cancer.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.056
This disease is pervasive.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.656
It's emotionally draining

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.896
and, for many,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.320
financially destructive.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.440
But a cancer diagnosis
doesn't have to be a death sentence.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.776
Finding cancer early,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.016
closer its genesis,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.656
is one of the critical factors
to improving treatment options,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.656
reducing its emotional impact

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640
and minimizing financial burdens.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.775
Most importantly,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.056
finding cancer early --

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.976
which is one of the primary
aims of my research --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.160
greatly enhances your odds of survival.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.856
If we just look at the case
of breast cancer for example,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.376
we find that those who are diagnosed
and treated at stage one

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.160
have a five-year survival rate
of nearly 100 percent --

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
odds that decrease to just 22 percent
if treated at stage four.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
And similar trends are found
for colorectal and ovarian cancer.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.456
Now, we're all aware
that an early diagnosis that is accurate

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.600
is critical for survival.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.416
The problem is that many
cancer diagnostic tools are invasive,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.656
costly,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.896
often inaccurate

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.560
and they can take an agonizing
amount of time to get the results back.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.936
Still worse, when it comes
to some forms of cancer,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.256
such as ovarian,
liver or pancreatic cancer,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.960
good screening methods simply don't exist,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.936
meaning that often people wait
until physical symptoms surface,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.440
which are themselves already
indicators of late-stage progression.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.496
Like a tornado strike in an area
without an early warning system,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.416
there is no alarm to warn,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.296
for the danger is already at your doorstep

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.360
when your odds of survival
are greatly reduced.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.656
Having the convenience and accessibility
of regular screening options

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.016
that are affordable, noninvasive
and could provide results much sooner,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.480
would provide us with a formidable
weapon in the fight against cancer.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.816
An early warning would allow us
to get out ahead of the disease

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.576
instead of merely
following in its relentless wake.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.576
And this is exactly what I've been doing.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.736
For the past three years,
I've been developing technologies

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.496
that could ultimately aid clinicians

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.440
with rapid, early-stage
cancer diagnostics.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.776
And I've been fueled
by a deep scientific curiosity,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320
and a passion to change these statistics.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.080
Last year however,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.720
this fight became much more personal

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.360
when my wife was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.976
It was an experience that added a strong
and unexpected emotional dimension

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.200
to these efforts.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.520
I know firsthand how life-altering
treatment can be,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.176
and I'm keenly aware
of the emotional havoc

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.656
that cancer can wreak on a family,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.080
which in our case
included our two young daughters.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.536
Because we found it early
during a routine mammogram,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.256
we were able to focus
primarily on treatment options

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.816
for the localized tumor,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.240
reaffirming to me
how important an early diagnosis is.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.440
Unlike other forms of cancer,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.056
mammograms do offer an early-stage
screening option for breast cancer.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.296
Still, not everyone has this done,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.906
or they may develop breast cancer

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.050
before the middle age recommendation
for having a mammogram.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.816
So, there's still
a lot of room for improvement,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.096
even for cancers
that do have screening options,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
and, of course, considerable benefits
for those that don't.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.416
A key challenge then
for cancer researchers

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.736
is to develop methods

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.296
that make regular screening
for many types of cancers

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.560
much more accessible.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.976
Imagine a scenario
where during your regular checkup,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.776
your doctor can take
a simple, noninvasive urine sample,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.040
or other liquid biopsy,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.244
and present you with the results
before you even leave the doctor's office.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.336
Such a technology could
dramatically reduce the number of people

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.600
who slip through the net
of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.656
My research team
of engineers and biochemists

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.720
is working on exactly this challenge.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.456
We're working on ways to frequently
activate an early-stage cancer alarm

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.816
by enabling regular screenings
that would start when a person is healthy

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.136
so that action could be taken
to stop cancer the moment it emerges,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.840
and before it can progress
beyond its infancy.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.656
The silver bullet in this case
are tiny vesicles,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.120
little escape pods regularly shed
by cells called exosomes.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.416
Exosomes are important biomarkers

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.720
that provide an early-warning system
for the development of cancer.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.136
And because they're abundantly present
in just about every bodily fluid,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.656
including blood, urine and saliva,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.880
they're extremely attractive
for noninvasive liquid biopsies.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.616
There's just one problem.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.936
An automated system for rapidly sorting
these important biomarkers

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.560
is not currently available.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.976
We've created a technology
that we call nano-DLD

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120
that is capable of precisely this:

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.616
automated exosome isolation

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.120
to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.576
Exosomes are the newest
early-warning weapon, if you will,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.656
to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.976
And they're really, really small.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.520
They measure just 30 to 150
nanometers in diameter.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.576
This is so tiny

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.240
that you could fit about a million
of them into a single red blood cell.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.136
That's roughly the difference
between a golf ball

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.880
and a fine grain piece of sand.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.616
Once thought to be little bins
for unwanted cellular waste,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.616
it has been found
that cells actually communicate

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.776
by producing and absorbing these exosomes

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.176
which contain surface receptors,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200
proteins and other genetic material
collected from their cell of origin.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.176
When absorbed by a neighboring cell,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.016
exosomes release their contents
into the receiving cell,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.256
and can set in motion
fundamental changes in gene expression --

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.496
some good,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.256
and this is where cancer comes in,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.856
some bad.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.656
Because they are clothed
in the material of the mother cell,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.616
and contain a sample of its environment,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.720
they provide a genetic snapshot
of that cell's health and its origin.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.336
All of these qualities
make exosomes invaluable messengers

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.976
that potentially allow physicians

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.920
to eavesdrop on your health
at the cellular level.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.736
To catch cancer early, however,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.696
you have to frequently
intercept these messages

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.216
to determine when cancer-causing
troublemakers within your body

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.056
decide to start staging a coup,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.096
which is why regular
screening is so critical

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.960
and why we're developing
technologies to make this possible.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.776
While the first exosome-based diagnostics
emerged on the market just this year,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.080
they are not yet part
of mainstream healthcare options.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.176
In addition to their recent emergence,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.656
another factor that's limiting
their widespread adoption

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.616
is that currently, no automated
exosome isolation system exists

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.840
to make regular screening
economically accessible.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.536
The current gold standard
for exosome isolation

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.496
includes ultracentrifugation,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.776
a process requiring
expensive laboratory equipment,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.056
a trained lab tech

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.120
and about 30 hours of time
to process a sample.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.256
We've come up with a different approach
for achieving automated exosome isolation

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.720
from a sample such as urine.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.816
We use a chip-based, continuous flow
separation technique

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.816
called deterministic lateral displacement.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.216
And we have done with it

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.696
what the semiconductor industry has done
so successfully for the past 50 years.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.776
We shrunk the dimensions
of this technology

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.440
from the micron scale
to the true nanoscale.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.176
So how does it work?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.456
In a nutshell,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.456
a set of tiny pillars
separated by nanoscopic gaps

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.736
are arranged in such a way

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.816
that the system divides
the fluid into streamlines,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.216
with the larger cancer-related
nanoparticles being separated

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.136
through a process of redirection
from the smaller, healthier ones,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.696
which can in contrast

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.256
move around the pillars
in a zigzag-type motion

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.840
in the direction of fluid flow.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.080
The net result is a complete separation
of these two particle populations.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.136
You can visualize this separation process

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.016
similar to traffic on a highway
that separates into two roads,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.496
with one road going into
a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.576
and the other road going around it.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.376
Here, smaller cars
can go through the tunnel

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.696
while larger trucks,
carrying potentially hazardous material,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.480
are forced to take the detour route.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.696
Traffic is effectively separated
by size and contents

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.736
without impeding its flow.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.040
And this is exactly how our system works
on a much, much smaller scale.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.456
The idea here is that
the separation process for screening

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.536
could be as simple as processing
a sample of urine, blood or saliva,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.856
which is a near-term possibility
within the next few years.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.176
Ultimately, it could be used
to isolate and detect target exosomes

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.416
associated with
a particular type of cancer,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.880
sensing and reporting
their presence within minutes.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.800
This would make rapid diagnostics
virtually painless.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.976
Broadly speaking,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.656
the ability to separate
and enrich biomarkers

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.400
with nanoscale precision
in an automated way,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.776
opens the door to better understanding
diseases such as cancer,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.776
with applications ranging
from sample preparation to diagnostics,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.280
and from drug resistance
monitoring to therapeutics.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.456
Even before my wife's bout with cancer,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.960
it was a dream of mine to facilitate
the automation of this process --

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.776
to make regular screening more accessible,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.696
similar to the way Henry Ford
made the automobile accessible

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.296
to the general population

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.576
through development of the assembly line.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.360
Automation is the key to accessibility.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.136
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.056
"a chicken in every pot
and a car in every garage,"

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.496
we're developing a technology

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.336
that could ultimately place
an early-warning cancer detection system

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.560
in every home.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.056
This would allow
every man, woman and child

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.216
the opportunity to be regularly tested
while they're still healthy,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.120
catching cancer when it first emerges.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.896
It is my hope and dream

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.616
to help people around the world
avoid the high costs --

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.176
physical, financial and emotional --

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.920
faced by today's cancer patients,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.920
hardships that I'm well acquainted with.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.776
I'm also happy to report that because
we caught my wife's cancer early,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.456
her treatment was successful,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.736
and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.960
(Applause)

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.560
It is an outcome that I would like to see
for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.336
With the work that my team
has already done

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.096
on separation of nanoscale biomarkers

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.056
for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.616
I am optimistic
that within the next decade,

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.216
this type of technology will be available,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.120
helping protect our friends,
our family and future generations.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.576
Even if we are so unlucky
as to be diagnosed with cancer,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.480
that early-stage alarm
will provide a strong beacon of hope.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.496
Thank you.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.309
(Applause)
