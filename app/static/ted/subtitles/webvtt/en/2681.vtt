00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.576
The last time I heard my son's voice

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.936
was when he walked out the front door

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.240
on his way to school.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.680
He called out one word in the darkness:

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.520
"Bye."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was April 20, 1999.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.936
Later that morning,
at Columbine High School,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.896
my son Dylan and his friend Eric

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.240
killed 12 students and a teacher

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.960
and wounded more than 20 others
before taking their own lives.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.216
Thirteen innocent people were killed,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.440
leaving their loved ones
in a state of grief and trauma.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.176
Others sustained injuries,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.240
some resulting in disfigurement
and permanent disability.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.656
But the enormity of the tragedy

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.800
can't be measured only by the number
of deaths and injuries that took place.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.136
There's no way to quantify
the psychological damage

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.096
of those who were in the school,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.480
or who took part
in rescue or cleanup efforts.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.920
There's no way to assess
the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.936
especially when it can be a blueprint

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.400
for other shooters who go on
to commit atrocities of their own.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.440
Columbine was a tidal wave,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.456
and when the crash ended,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.416
it would take years
for the community and for society

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.160
to comprehend its impact.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.840
It has taken me years
to try to accept my son's legacy.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.896
The cruel behavior
that defined the end of his life

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.480
showed me that he was a completely
different person from the one I knew.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.976
Afterwards people asked,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760
"How could you not know?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.120
What kind of a mother were you?"

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.880
I still ask myself those same questions.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960
Before the shootings,
I thought of myself as a good mom.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.216
Helping my children become caring,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.576
healthy, responsible adults

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
was the most important role of my life.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.080
But the tragedy convinced me
that I failed as a parent,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.560
and it's partially this sense of failure
that brings me here today.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.496
Aside from his father,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.080
I was the one person
who knew and loved Dylan the most.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.056
If anyone could have known
what was happening,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.800
it should have been me, right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.200
But I didn't know.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.336
Today, I'm here to share the experience

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080
of what it's like to be the mother
of someone who kills and hurts.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.056
For years after the tragedy,
I combed through memories,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.680
trying to figure out
exactly where I failed as a parent.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.016
But there are no simple answers.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.960
I can't give you any solutions.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.720
All I can do

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.120
is share what I have learned.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.056
When I talk to people
who didn't know me before the shootings,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.880
I have three challenges to meet.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.840
First, when I walk into a room like this,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.056
I never know if someone there
has experienced loss

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.800
because of what my son did.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.216
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering
caused by a member of my family

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.440
who isn't here to do it for himself.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.640
So first, with all of my heart,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.400
The second challenge I have

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.760
is that I must ask for understanding
and even compassion

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.800
when I talk about
my son's death as a suicide.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.616
Two years before he died,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.856
he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.440
that he was cutting himself.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.816
He said that he was in agony

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.480
and wanted to get a gun
so he could end his life.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.920
I didn't know about any of this
until months after his death.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.136
When I talk about his death as a suicide,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.200
I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness
he showed at the end of his life.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.816
I'm trying to understand

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.936
how his suicidal thinking

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.400
led to murder.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.296
After a lot of reading
and talking with experts,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.976
I have come to believe

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.720
that his involvement in the shootings
was rooted not in his desire to kill

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160
but in his desire to die.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.616
The third challenge I have
when I talk about my son's murder-suicide

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.560
is that I'm talking about mental health --

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.896
excuse me --

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.536
is that I'm talking about mental health,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.736
or brain health, as I prefer to call it,
because it's more concrete.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.496
And in the same breath,
I'm talking about violence.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.096
The last thing I want to do
is to contribute to the misunderstanding

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.336
that already exists around mental illness.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.136
Only a very small percent of those
who have a mental illness

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.400
are violent toward other people,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.936
but of those who die by suicide,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.176
it's estimated that about 75
to maybe more than 90 percent

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.600
have a diagnosable
mental health condition of some kind.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.936
As you all know very well,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.920
our mental health care system
is not equipped to help everyone,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.496
and not everyone with destructive thoughts

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.256
fits the criteria

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.440
for a specific diagnosis.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.216
Many who have ongoing feelings

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.976
of fear or anger or hopelessness

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.880
are never assessed or treated.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.280
Too often, they get our attention
only if they reach a behavioral crisis.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.456
If estimates are correct

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.416
that about one
to two percent of all suicides

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.520
involves the murder of another person,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.000
when suicide rates rise,
as they are rising for some populations,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.400
the murder-suicide rates
will rise as well.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.016
I wanted to understand what was going on
in Dylan's mind prior to his death,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.760
so I looked for answers
from other survivors of suicide loss.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.176
I did research and volunteered
to help with fund-raising events,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.976
and whenever I could,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.496
I talked with those who had
survived their own suicidal crisis

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.720
or attempt.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.056
One of the most helpful
conversations I had

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.536
was with a coworker

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.465
who overheard me talking to someone else

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:21.689
in my office cubicle.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.176
She heard me say
that Dylan could not have loved me

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.960
if he could do something
as horrible as he did.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.800
Later, when she found me alone,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.216
she apologized for overhearing
that conversation,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.800
but told me that I was wrong.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.496
She said that when she was
a young, single mother

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.960
with three small children,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.240
she became severely depressed
and was hospitalized to keep her safe.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.296
At the time, she was certain

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.576
that her children
would be better off if she died,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.840
so she had made a plan to end her life.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.936
She assured me that a mother's love
was the strongest bond on Earth,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.000
and that she loved her children
more than anything in the world,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.856
but because of her illness,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.720
she was sure that they
would be better off without her.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.056
What she said and what
I've learned from others

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.816
is that we do not make
the so-called decision or choice

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.416
to die by suicide

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.296
in the same way
that we choose what car to drive

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.440
or where to go on a Saturday night.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.456
When someone is
in an extremely suicidal state,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.000
they are in a stage four
medical health emergency.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.160
Their thinking is impaired and they've
lost access to tools of self-governance.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.496
Even though they can
make a plan and act with logic,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.456
their sense of truth
is distorted by a filter of pain

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.080
through which they
interpret their reality.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.536
Some people can be very good
at hiding this state,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.920
and they often have
good reasons for doing that.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.016
Many of us have
suicidal thoughts at some point,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.536
but persistent,
ongoing thoughts of suicide

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.776
and devising a means to die

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.136
are symptoms of pathology,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.056
and like many illnesses,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.840
the condition has to be
recognized and treated

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040
before a life is lost.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.440
But my son's death
was not purely a suicide.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.960
It involved mass murder.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.960
I wanted to know how his
suicidal thinking became homicidal.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.080
But research is sparse
and there are no simple answers.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.159
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:46.240
He had a personality
that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.880
and that made him less likely
to seek help from others.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.336
He had experienced
triggering events at the school

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.760
that left him feeling
debased and humiliated and mad.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.416
And he had a complicated friendship

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.776
with a boy who shared his feelings
of rage and alienation,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.896
and who was seriously disturbed,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.800
controlling and homicidal.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.136
And on top of this period in his life

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.320
of extreme vulnerability and fragility,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.656
Dylan found access to guns

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.840
even though we'd never
owned any in our home.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.016
It was appallingly easy
for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.680
both legally and illegally,
without my permission or knowledge.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.400
And somehow, 17 years
and many school shootings later,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.880
it's still appallingly easy.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.880
What Dylan did that day broke my heart,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.096
and as trauma so often does,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.080
it took a toll on my body and on my mind.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.800
Two years after the shootings,
I got breast cancer,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.560
and two years after that,
I began to have mental health problems.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.896
On top of the constant, perpetual grief

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.496
I was terrified that I would run
into a family member

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.576
of someone Dylan had killed,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.976
or be accosted by the press

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480
or by an angry citizen.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.496
I was afraid to turn on the news,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.480
afraid to hear myself being called
a terrible parent or a disgusting person.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.360
I started having panic attacks.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.416
The first bout started
four years after the shootings,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.976
when I was getting ready
for the depositions

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.800
and would have to meet
the victims' families face to face.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.976
The second round started
six years after the shootings,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.456
when I was preparing
to speak publicly about murder-suicide

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.480
for the first time at a conference.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.920
Both episodes lasted several weeks.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.296
The attacks happened everywhere:

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.616
in the hardware store, in my office,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.680
or even while reading a book in bed.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.656
My mind would suddenly lock
into this spinning cycle of terror

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.776
and no matter how I hard I tried

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.856
to calm myself down
or reason my way out of it,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.160
I couldn't do it.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.000
It felt as if my brain
was trying to kill me,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.496
and then, being afraid of being afraid

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.320
consumed all of my thoughts.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.096
That's when I learned firsthand

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.560
what it feels like
to have a malfunctioning mind,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.120
and that's when I truly
became a brain health advocate.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.736
With therapy and medication and self-care,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.576
life eventually returned

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.080
to whatever could be thought of
as normal under the circumstances.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.296
When I looked back
on all that had happened,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.880
I could see that my son's
spiral into dysfunction

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.176
probably occurred
over a period of about two years,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.360
plenty of time to get him help,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.296
if only someone had known
that he needed help

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.640
and known what to do.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.256
Every time someone asks me,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.736
"How could you not have known?",

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760
it feels like a punch in the gut.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.376
It carries accusation
and taps into my feelings of guilt

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.896
that no matter how much therapy I've had

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.840
I will never fully eradicate.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.500
But here's something I've learned:

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.576
if love were enough

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.736
to stop someone who is suicidal

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.200
from hurting themselves,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.200
suicides would hardly ever happen.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.120
But love is not enough,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.000
and suicide is prevalent.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.496
It's the second leading cause of death

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.720
for people age 10 to 34,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.296
and 15 percent of American youth

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.056
report having made a suicide plan

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.280
in the last year.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.280
I've learned that no matter
how much we want to believe we can,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.816
we cannot know or control

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.800
everything our loved ones think and feel,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.880
and the stubborn belief
that we are somehow different,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.976
that someone we love
would never think of hurting themselves

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.200
or someone else,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.096
can cause us to miss

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.920
what's hidden in plain sight.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.280
And if worst case scenarios
do come to pass,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.416
we'll have to learn
to forgive ourselves for not knowing

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.136
or for not asking the right questions

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.880
or not finding the right treatment.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.496
We should always assume

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.160
that someone we love may be suffering,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.496
regardless of what they say

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.760
or how they act.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.840
We should listen with our whole being,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.000
without judgments,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.800
and without offering solutions.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.576
I know that I will live with this tragedy,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.536
with these multiple tragedies,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.120
for the rest of my life.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.320
I know that in the minds of many,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.840
what I lost can't compare
to what the other families lost.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.840
I know my struggle
doesn't make theirs any easier.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.376
I know there are even some who think
I don't have the right to any pain,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.240
but only to a life of permanent penance.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.480
In the end what I know comes down to this:

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.496
the tragic fact is that even
the most vigilant and responsible of us

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.440
may not be able to help,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.016
but for love's sake,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.216
we must never stop trying

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.720
to know the unknowable.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.776
Thank you.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.960
(Applause)
