00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.786
So I'm here to talk to you
about the walkable city.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.169
What is the walkable city?

00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:07.674
Well, for want of a better definition,

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:14.586
it's a city in which the car
is an optional instrument of freedom,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.494
rather than a prosthetic device.

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:19.473
And I'd like to talk about
why we need the walkable city,

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:23.655
and I'd like to talk about
how to do the walkable city.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.019
Most of the talks I give these days
are about why we need it,

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:31.139
but you guys are smart.

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:35.561
And also I gave that talk
exactly a month ago,

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.652
and you can see it at TED.com.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:40.676
So today I want to talk
about how to do it.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.639
In a lot of time thinking about this,

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:45.763
I've come up with what I call
the general theory of walkability.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.717
A bit of a pretentious term,
it's a little tongue-in-cheek,

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:51.315
but it's something
I've thought about for a long time,

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.723
and I'd like to share
what I think I've figured out.

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:57.586
In the American city,
the typical American city --

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.850
the typical American city
is not Washington, DC,

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:02.182
or New York, or San Francisco;

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.453
it's Grand Rapids or Cedar
Rapids or Memphis --

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:08.588
in the typical American city
in which most people own cars

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.933
and the temptation
is to drive them all the time,

00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:14.736
if you're going to get them to walk,
then you have to offer a walk

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.608
that's as good as a drive or better.

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:17.783
What does that mean?

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:20.348
It means you need to offer
four things simultaneously:

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.429
there needs to be a proper reason to walk,

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:24.803
the walk has to be safe and feel safe,

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:26.522
the walk has to be comfortable

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:28.315
and the walk has to be interesting.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.949
You need to do all four
of these things simultaneously,

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.003
and that's the structure of my talk today,

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:34.656
to take you through each of those.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.944
The reason to walk
is a story I learned from my mentors,

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.328
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:42.353
the founders of the New Urbanism movement.

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:45.890
And I should say half the slides
and half of my talk today

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.240
I learned from them.

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.043
It's the story of planning,

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.307
the story of the formation
of the planning profession.

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:57.082
When in the 19th century
people were choking

00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:59.599
from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.999
the planners said, hey, let's move
the housing away from the mills.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.490
And lifespans increased
immediately, dramatically,

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:08.665
and we like to say

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.881
the planners have been trying to repeat
that experience ever since.

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.547
So there's the onset
of what we call Euclidean zoning,

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.646
the separation of the landscape
into large areas of single use.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.147
And typically when I arrive
in a city to do a plan,

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.210
a plan like this already awaits me
on the property that I'm looking at.

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:26.936
And all a plan like this guarantees

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.999
is that you will not have a walkable city,

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.943
because nothing is located
near anything else.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.607
The alternative, of course,
is our most walkable city,

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.161
and I like to say, you know,
this is a Rothko,

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.688
and this is a Seurat.

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:42.253
It's just a different way --
he was the pointilist --

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:44.110
it's a different way of making places.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:46.943
And even this map of Manhattan
is a bit misleading

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:51.147
because the red color
is uses that are mixed vertically.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.875
So this is the big story
of the New Urbanists --

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.411
to acknowledge
that there are only two ways

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.725
that have been tested by the thousands

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.689
to build communities,
in the world and throughout history.

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:03.591
One is the traditional neighborhood.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:07.029
You see here several neighborhoods
of Newburyport, Massachusetts,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:11.320
which is defined as being compact
and being diverse --

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:15.486
places to live, work, shop,
recreate, get educated --

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.389
all within walking distance.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:19.549
And it's defined as being walkable.

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:21.107
There are lots of small streets.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.857
Each one is comfortable to walk on.

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:25.395
And we contrast that to the other way,

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.238
an invention that happened
after the Second World War,

00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:29.520
suburban sprawl,

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:34.121
clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
and it's not walkable,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.043
because so few of the streets connect,

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.950
that those streets that do connect
become overburdened,

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:41.064
and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.939
And I want to thank Alex Maclean,
the aerial photographer,

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:47.018
for many of these beautiful pictures
that I'm showing you today.

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:50.662
So it's fun to break sprawl down
into its constituent parts.

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.263
It's so easy to understand,

00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:55.290
the places where you only live,
the places where you only work,

00:03:56.144 --> 00:03:58.100
the places where you only shop,

00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:01.468
and our super-sized public institutions.

00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:02.932
Schools get bigger and bigger,

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:05.352
and therefore, further
and further from each other.

00:04:05.376 --> 00:04:08.505
And the ratio of the size
of the parking lot

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:09.745
to the size of the school

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.385
tells you all you need to know,

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.947
which is that no child
has ever walked to this school,

00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:15.876
no child will ever walk to this school.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.740
The seniors and juniors are driving
the freshmen and the sophomores,

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:22.388
and of course we have
the crash statistics to prove it.

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:25.880
And then the super-sizing
of our other civic institutions

00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:27.074
like playing fields --

00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:30.971
it's wonderful that Westin
in the Ft. Lauderdale area

00:04:30.995 --> 00:04:34.063
has eight soccer fields
and eight baseball diamonds

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:35.946
and 20 tennis courts,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.582
but look at the road
that takes you to that location,

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.552
and would you let your child bike on it?

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.706
And this is why we have
the soccer mom now.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.972
When I was young, I had one soccer field,

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:48.021
one baseball diamond and one tennis court,

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:50.903
but I could walk to it,
because it was in my neighborhood.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:53.778
Then the final part of sprawl
that everyone forgot to count:

00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:56.622
if you're going to separate everything
from everything else

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.180
and reconnect it
only with automotive infrastructure,

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:01.726
then this is what your landscape
begins to look like.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.965
The main message here is:

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:06.591
if you want to have a walkable city,
you can't start with the sprawl model.

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:08.686
you need the bones of an urban model.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.558
This is the outcome
of that form of design,

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:12.973
as is this.

00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:15.586
And this is something
that a lot of Americans want.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.323
But we have to understand
it's a two-part American dream.

00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:19.707
If you're dreaming for this,

00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:23.112
you're also going to be dreaming of this,
often to absurd extremes,

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:25.753
when we build our landscape
to accommodate cars first.

00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:28.018
And the experience
of being in these places --

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:29.059
(Laughter)

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:30.463
This is not Photoshopped.

00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:32.489
Walter Kulash took this slide.

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:34.210
It's in Panama City.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.023
This is a real place.

00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:38.526
And being a driver
can be a bit of a nuisance,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.015
and being a pedestrian
can be a bit of a nuisance

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.540
in these places.

00:05:42.564 --> 00:05:46.038
This is a slide that epidemiologists
have been showing for some time now,

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:47.078
(Laughter)

00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:50.567
The fact that we have a society
where you drive to the parking lot

00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.465
to take the escalator to the treadmill

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.417
shows that we're doing something wrong.

00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.013
But we know how to do it better.

00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:57.720
Here are the two models contrasted.

00:05:57.744 --> 00:05:58.899
I show this slide,

00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:01.709
which has been a formative document
of the New Urbanism now

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:03.137
for almost 30 years,

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:07.320
to show that sprawl and the traditional
neighborhood contain the same things.

00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:08.730
It's just how big are they,

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:10.353
how close are they to each other,

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:12.052
how are they interspersed together

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.993
and do you have a street network,
rather than a cul-de-sac

00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:17.052
or a collector system of streets?

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.893
So when we look at a downtown area,

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.052
at a place that has a hope
of being walkable,

00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:23.634
and mostly that's our downtowns
in America's cities

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:25.426
and towns and villages,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.515
we look at them and say
we want the proper balance of uses.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.674
So what is missing or underrepresented?

00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:34.358
And again, in the typical American cities
in which most Americans live,

00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:36.392
it is housing that is lacking.

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.606
The jobs-to-housing balance is off.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.813
And you find that when
you bring housing back,

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.903
these other things start to come back too,

00:06:42.927 --> 00:06:45.403
and housing is usually first
among those things.

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:48.531
And, of course, the thing
that shows up last and eventually

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:49.736
is the schools,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.080
because the people have to move in,

00:06:52.104 --> 00:06:56.925
the young pioneers have to move in,
get older, have kids

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.987
and fight, and then the schools
get pretty good eventually.

00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.313
The other part of this part,

00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:05.828
the useful city part,

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:07.157
is transit,

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.546
and you can have a perfectly
walkable neighborhood without it.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.875
But perfectly walkable cities
require transit,

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.340
because if you don't have access
to the whole city as a pedestrian,

00:07:17.364 --> 00:07:18.525
then you get a car,

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:19.704
and if you get a car,

00:07:19.728 --> 00:07:22.276
the city begins to reshape itself
around your needs,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.982
and the streets get wider
and the parking lots get bigger

00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:26.883
and you no longer have a walkable city.

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:28.062
So transit is essential.

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:30.487
But every transit experience,
every transit trip,

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:32.406
begins or ends as a walk,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.228
and so we have to remember to build
walkability around our transit stations.

00:07:36.252 --> 00:07:38.997
Next category, the biggest one,
is the safe walk.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.237
It's what most walkability
experts talk about.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:45.302
It is essential, but alone not enough
to get people to walk.

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:48.469
And there are so many moving parts
that add up to a walkable city.

00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.069
The first is block size.

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:51.440
This is Portland, Oregon,

00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:55.030
famously 200-foot blocks,
famously walkable.

00:07:55.054 --> 00:07:56.372
This is Salt Lake City,

00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:58.476
famously 600-foot blocks,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.869
famously unwalkable.

00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.899
If you look at the two,
it's almost like two different planets,

00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:05.239
but these places were both built by humans

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:08.903
and in fact, the story is that when
you have a 200-foot block city,

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:10.461
you can have a two-lane city,

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:11.902
or a two-to-four lane city,

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:15.951
and a 600-foot block city
is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.453
These are the crash statistics.

00:08:17.477 --> 00:08:19.563
When you double the block size --

00:08:19.587 --> 00:08:21.620
this was a study
of 24 California cities --

00:08:21.644 --> 00:08:23.136
when you double the block size,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.786
you almost quadruple
the number of fatal accidents

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.811
on non-highway streets.

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.066
So how many lanes do we have?

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.567
This is where I'm going to tell you
what I tell every audience I meet,

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:37.321
which is to remind you
about induced demand.

00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:41.782
Induced demand applies
both to highways and to city streets.

00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:45.291
And induced demand tells us
that when we widen the streets

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:48.413
to accept the congestion
that we're anticipating,

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:50.774
or the additional trips
that we're anticipating

00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:54.711
in congested systems,
it is principally that congestion

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:56.728
that is constraining demand,

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.514
and so that the widening comes,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.654
and there are all of these latent trips
that are ready to happen.

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:03.067
People move further from work

00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.324
and make other choices
about when they commute,

00:09:05.348 --> 00:09:07.722
and those lanes fill up
very quickly with traffic,

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.247
so we widen the street again,
and they fill up again.

00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:12.497
And we've learned that
in congested systems,

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.936
we cannot satisfy the automobile.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.410
This is from Newsweek Magazine --
hardly an esoteric publication:

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:20.102
"Today's engineers acknowledge

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:23.352
that building new roads
usually makes traffic worse."

00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.939
My response to reading this was,
may I please meet some of these engineers,

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:29.029
because these are not the ones that I --

00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:31.643
there are great exceptions
that I'm working with now --

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:34.973
but these are not the engineers
one typically meets working in a city,

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:38.463
where they say, "Oh, that road
is too crowded, we need to add a lane."

00:09:38.487 --> 00:09:40.647
So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,

00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.128
and they say, "See, I told you
we needed that lane."

00:09:43.152 --> 00:09:46.944
This applies both to highways
and to city streets if they're congested.

00:09:46.968 --> 00:09:50.003
But the amazing thing
about most American cities that I work in,

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.316
the more typical cities,

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.372
is that they have a lot of streets
that are actually oversized

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:56.803
for the congestion
they're currently experiencing.

00:09:56.827 --> 00:09:58.550
This was the case in Oklahoma City,

00:09:58.574 --> 00:10:01.093
when the mayor came running
to me, very upset,

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:03.521
because they were named
in Prevention Magazine

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:06.698
the worst city for pedestrians
in the entire country.

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.428
Now that can't possibly be true,

00:10:08.452 --> 00:10:11.581
but it certainly is enough
to make a mayor do something about it.

00:10:11.605 --> 00:10:12.914
We did a walkability study,

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:16.273
and what we found, looking
at the car counts on the street --

00:10:16.297 --> 00:10:19.972
these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:23.943
and we know that two lanes
can handle 10,000 cars per day.

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:28.624
Look at these numbers --
they're all near or under 10,000 cars,

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:31.222
and these were the streets
that were designated

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.458
in the new downtown plan

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:36.116
to be four lanes to six lanes wide.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.385
So you had a fundamental disconnect
between the number of lanes

00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:41.651
and the number of cars
that wanted to use them.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:45.590
So it was my job to redesign
every street in the downtown

00:10:45.614 --> 00:10:47.349
from curb face to curb face,

00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:49.375
and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.756
and we're rebuilding it now.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.820
So a typical oversized street to nowhere

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:56.044
is being narrowed, and now
under construction,

00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:57.708
and the project is half done.

00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:59.723
The typical street like this, you know,

00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:03.193
when you do that,
you find room for medians.

00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:05.199
You find room for bike lanes.

00:11:05.223 --> 00:11:07.390
We've doubled the amount
of on-street parking.

00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:11.363
We've added a full bike network
where one didn't exist before.

00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:14.634
But not everyone has the money
that Oklahoma City has,

00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:17.742
because they have an extraction
economy that's doing quite well.

00:11:17.766 --> 00:11:19.818
The typical city is more
like Cedar Rapids,

00:11:19.842 --> 00:11:23.832
where they have an all four-lane
system, half one-way system.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:25.305
And it's a little hard to see,

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:28.613
but what we've done -- what we're doing;
it's in process right now,

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:30.241
it's in engineering right now --

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:34.056
is turning an all four-lane
system, half one-way

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.657
into an all two-lane system, all two-way,

00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.922
and in so doing, we're adding
70 percent more on-street parking,

00:11:40.946 --> 00:11:42.305
which the merchants love,

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:43.749
and it protects the sidewalk.

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.535
That parking makes the sidewalk safe,

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:49.237
and we're adding a much more
robust bicycle network.

00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:51.842
Then the lanes themselves.
How wide are they?

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:53.076
That's really important.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.266
The standards have changed
such that, as Andrés Duany says,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.384
the typical road
to a subdivision in America

00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:00.600
allows you to see
the curvature of the Earth.

00:12:00.624 --> 00:12:01.663
(Laughter)

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.932
This is a subdivision
outside of Washington from the 1960s.

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.277
Look very carefully
at the width of the streets.

00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:09.408
This is a subdivision from the 1980s.

00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:11.067
1960s, 1980s.

00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:13.115
The standards have changed
to such a degree

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.092
that my old neighborhood of South Beach,

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:18.275
when it was time to fix the street
that wasn't draining properly,

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.843
they had to widen it
and take away half our sidewalk,

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:22.606
because the standards were wider.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.085
People go faster on wider streets.

00:12:26.109 --> 00:12:27.266
People know this.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.416
The engineers deny it,
but the citizens know it,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.266
so that in Birmingham, Michigan,
they fight for narrower streets.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.812
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,

00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:40.381
instituted its "Skinny Streets" program
in its residential neighborhood.

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:42.255
We know that skinny streets are safer.

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:45.325
The developer Vince Graham,
in his project I'On,

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.165
which we worked on in South Carolina,

00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:51.104
he goes to conferences and he shows
his amazing 22-foot roads.

00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:53.541
These are two-way roads,
very narrow rights of way,

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.564
and he shows this well-known philosopher,

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:58.458
who said, "Broad is the road
that leads to destruction ...

00:12:58.482 --> 00:13:00.583
narrow is the road that leads to life."

00:13:00.607 --> 00:13:02.667
(Laughter)

00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:05.060
(Applause)

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.143
This plays very well in the South.

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.064
Now: bicycles.

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:14.411
Bicycles and bicycling
are the current revolution underway

00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:16.118
in only some American cities.

00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.783
But where you build it, they come.

00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:21.816
As a planner, I hate to say that,
but the one thing I can say

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.967
is that bicycle population
is a function of bicycle infrastructure.

00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:29.406
I asked my friend Tom Brennan
from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.010
to send me some pictures
of the Portland bike commute.

00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:34.542
He sent me this. I said,
"Was that bike to work day?"

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:36.211
He said, "No, that was Tuesday."

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:41.199
When you do what Portland did and spend
money on bicycle infrastructure --

00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:45.444
New York City has doubled the number
of bikers in it several times now

00:13:45.468 --> 00:13:47.505
by painting these bright green lanes.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:51.095
Even automotive cities
like Long Beach, California:

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:55.198
vast uptick in the number of bikers
based on the infrastructure.

00:13:55.222 --> 00:13:56.913
And of course, what really does it,

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.313
if you know 15th Street
here in Washington, DC --

00:13:59.337 --> 00:14:02.314
please meet Rahm Emanuel's
new bike lanes in Chicago,

00:14:02.338 --> 00:14:05.716
the buffered lane, the parallel parking
pulled off the curb,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.742
the bikes between the parked
cars and the curb --

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.687
these mint cyclists.

00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:15.262
If, however, as in Pasadena,
every lane is a bike lane,

00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:17.247
then no lane is a bike lane.

00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:20.383
And this is the only bicyclist
that I met in Pasadena, so ...

00:14:20.407 --> 00:14:22.012
(Laughter)

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:23.727
The parallel parking I mentioned --

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:25.373
it's an essential barrier of steel

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:29.183
that protects the curb and pedestrians
from moving vehicles.

00:14:29.207 --> 00:14:32.803
This is Ft. Lauderdale;
one side of the street, you can park,

00:14:32.827 --> 00:14:34.779
the other side of the street, you can't.

00:14:34.803 --> 00:14:36.828
This is happy hour on the parking side.

00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:39.543
This is sad hour on the other side.

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:42.556
And then the trees themselves
slow cars down.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.866
They move slower when trees
are next to the road,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.445
and, of course, sometimes
they slow down very quickly.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:51.071
All the little details --
the curb return radius.

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:52.757
Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:56.227
How swoopy is that curb to determine
how fast the car goes

00:14:56.251 --> 00:14:57.966
and how much room you have to cross.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.412
And then I love this,
because this is objective journalism.

00:15:01.436 --> 00:15:05.515
"Some say the entrance to CityCenter
is not inviting to pedestrians."

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:07.997
When every aspect
of the landscape is swoopy,

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:10.694
is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,

00:15:10.718 --> 00:15:13.035
it says: "This is a vehicular place."

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:18.134
So no one detail, no one speciality,
can be allowed to set the stage.

00:15:18.158 --> 00:15:19.722
And here, you know, this street:

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:23.638
yes, it will drain within a minute
of the hundred-year storm,

00:15:23.662 --> 00:15:26.454
but this poor woman
has to mount the curb every day.

00:15:26.478 --> 00:15:29.424
So then quickly, the comfortable walk
has to do with the fact

00:15:29.448 --> 00:15:34.401
that all animals seek, simultaneously,
prospect and refuge.

00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:36.525
We want to be able to see our predators,

00:15:36.549 --> 00:15:39.068
but we also want to feel
that our flanks are covered.

00:15:39.092 --> 00:15:41.583
And so we're drawn to places
that have good edges,

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:44.935
and if you don't supply the edges,
people won't want to be there.

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.098
What's the proper ratio
of height to width?

00:15:47.122 --> 00:15:48.897
Is it one to one? Three to one?

00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:52.706
If you get beyond one to six,
you're not very comfortable anymore.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.049
You don't feel enclosed.

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:57.218
Now, six to one in Salzburg
can be perfectly delightful.

00:15:57.242 --> 00:15:59.629
The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.

00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:04.087
The point being the parking lot
is the principal problem here.

00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:07.686
However, missing teeth, those empty lots
can be issues as well,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.955
and if you have a missing corner
because of an outdated zoning code,

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:13.887
then you could have a missing nose
in your neighborhood.

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:15.748
That's what we had in my neighborhood.

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:18.848
This was the zoning code that said
I couldn't build on that site.

00:16:18.872 --> 00:16:22.599
As you may know, Washington, DC
is now changing its zoning

00:16:22.623 --> 00:16:25.753
to allow sites like this
to become sites like this.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.943
We needed a lot of variances to do that.

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:30.251
Triangular houses
can be interesting to build,

00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:32.977
but if you get one built,
people generally like it.

00:16:33.001 --> 00:16:35.454
So you've got to fill those missing noses.

00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:37.436
And then, finally, the interesting walk:

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.132
signs of humanity.

00:16:39.156 --> 00:16:40.971
We are among the social primates.

00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:43.183
Nothing interests us more
than other people.

00:16:43.207 --> 00:16:44.701
We want signs of people.

00:16:44.725 --> 00:16:47.728
So the perfect one-to-one ratio,
it's a great thing.

00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:49.956
This is Grand Rapids,
a very walkable city,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.622
but nobody walks on this street

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:53.757
that connects the two
best hotels together,

00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:58.149
because if on the left,
you have an exposed parking deck,

00:16:58.173 --> 00:17:00.657
and on the right,
you have a conference facility

00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:04.110
that was apparently designed
in admiration for that parking deck,

00:17:04.134 --> 00:17:06.641
then you don't attract that many people.

00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:10.639
Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term,
Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina,

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:12.840
taught us it only takes
25 feet of building

00:17:12.864 --> 00:17:15.158
to hide 250 feet of garage.

00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:17.902
This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.
It's in South Beach.

00:17:17.926 --> 00:17:19.370
That active ground floor.

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:22.113
I want to end with this project
that I love to show.

00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:24.648
It's by Meleca Architects.
It's in Columbus, Ohio.

00:17:24.672 --> 00:17:28.362
To the left is the convention center
neighborhood, full of pedestrians.

00:17:28.386 --> 00:17:31.050
To the right is the Short North
neighborhood -- ethnic,

00:17:31.074 --> 00:17:33.771
great restaurants,
great shops, struggling.

00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:36.349
It wasn't doing very well
because this was the bridge,

00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:38.840
and no one was walking
from the convention center

00:17:38.864 --> 00:17:40.213
into that neighborhood.

00:17:40.237 --> 00:17:44.530
Well, when they rebuilt the highway,
they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:47.028
Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge
over the highway.

00:17:47.052 --> 00:17:49.425
The city paid 1.9 million dollars,

00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:51.695
they gave the site to a developer,

00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:53.110
the developer built this

00:17:53.134 --> 00:17:55.453
and now the Short North
has come back to life.

00:17:55.477 --> 00:17:58.693
And everyone says, the newspapers,
not the planning magazines,

00:17:58.717 --> 00:18:00.938
the newspapers say
it's because of that bridge.

00:18:00.962 --> 00:18:03.582
So that's it. That's the general
theory of walkability.

00:18:03.606 --> 00:18:05.626
Think about your own cities.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.067
Think about how you can apply it.

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:10.045
You've got to do all four things at once.

00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:12.378
So find those places
where you have most of them

00:18:12.402 --> 00:18:14.307
and fix what you can,

00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:17.015
fix what still needs fixing
in those places.

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.807
I really appreciate your attention,

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.507
and thank you for coming today.

00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:24.079
(Applause)
