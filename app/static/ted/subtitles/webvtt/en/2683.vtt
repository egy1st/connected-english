00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.800
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people
experience armed conflict.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.576
In response, people are forced
to flee their country,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.720
leaving over 15 million refugees.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.856
Children, without a doubt,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.360
are the most innocent
and vulnerable victims ...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.256
but not just from
the obvious physical dangers,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
but from the often unspoken effects
that wars have on their families.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.496
The experiences of war
leave children at a real high risk

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.439
for the development
of emotional and behavioral problems.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.816
Children, as we can only imagine,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.920
will feel worried, threatened and at risk.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.760
But there is good news.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.136
The quality of care
that children receive in their families

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.616
can have a more significant
effect on their well-being

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.320
than from the actual experiences of war
that they have been exposed to.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.176
So actually, children can be protected

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.640
by warm, secure parenting
during and after conflict.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.256
In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480
in the University of Manchester
School of Psychological Sciences.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.496
Like many of you here,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
I watched the crisis in Syria
unfold in front of me on the TV.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.856
My family is originally from Syria,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.136
and very early on,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.840
I lost several family members
in really horrifying ways.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.440
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family
and watch the TV.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.616
We've all seen those scenes:

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.696
bombs destroying buildings,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.160
chaos, destruction

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.612
and people screaming and running.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.376
It was always the people screaming
and running that really got me the most,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640
especially those
terrified-looking children.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.096
I was a mother to two young,
typically inquisitive children.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.696
They were five and six then,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.776
at an age where they typically
asked lots and lots of questions,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920
and expected real, convincing answers.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.776
So, I began to wonder
what it might be like

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.200
to parent my children
in a war zone and a refugee camp.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.560
Would my children change?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.880
Would my daughter's bright,
happy eyes lose their shine?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
Would my son's really relaxed and carefree
nature become fearful and withdrawn?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.040
How would I cope?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.640
Would I change?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.856
As psychologists and parent trainers,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.776
we know that arming parents
with skills in caring for their children

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.360
can have a huge effect
on their well-being,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080
and we call this parent training.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.616
The question I had was,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.376
could parent training programs
be useful for families

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.416
while they were still in war zones
or refugee camps?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.016
Could we reach them
with advice or training

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160
that would help them
through these struggles?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.576
So I approached my PhD supervisor,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.096
Professor Rachel Calam,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.400
with the idea of using my academic skills
to make some change in the real world.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.999
I wasn't quite sure
what exactly I wanted to do.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.896
She listened carefully and patiently,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.496
and then to my joy she said,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.376
"If that's what you want to do,
and it means so much to you,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.656
then let's do it.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.656
Let's find ways to see if parent programs

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.040
can be useful for families
in these contexts."

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.856
So for the past five years,
myself and my colleagues --

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.456
Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright --

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.696
have been working
on ways to support families

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.920
that have experienced
war and displacement.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.976
Now, to know how to help families
that have been through conflict

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.416
support their children,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.256
the first step must obviously be
to ask them what they're struggling with,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.496
right?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.896
I mean, it seems obvious.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.296
But it's often those
that are the most vulnerable,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.736
that we're trying to support,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.096
that we actually don't ask.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.296
How many times have we just assumed
we know exactly the right thing

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.960
that's going to help someone or something
without actually asking them first?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.056
So I travelled to refugee camps
in Syria and in Turkey,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.440
and I sat with families, and I listened.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.976
I listened to their parenting challenges,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.256
I listened to their parenting struggles

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.496
and I listened to their call for help.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.536
And sometimes that was just paused,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.616
as all I could do was hold hands with them

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.840
and just join them
in silent crying and prayer.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.016
They told me about their struggles,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.816
they told me about the rough,
harsh refugee camp conditions

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.055
that made it hard to focus
on anything but practical chores

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.880
like collecting clean water.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.160
They told me how they watched
their children withdraw;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.096
the sadness, depression, anger,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.296
bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,
fear of loud noises,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.176
fear of nightmares --

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.920
terrifying, terrifying nightmares.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.640
These families had been through
what we had been watching on the TV.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.456
The mothers --

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.656
almost half of them
were now widows of war,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.456
or didn't even know
if their husbands were dead or alive --

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.160
described how they felt
they were coping so badly.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.536
They watched their children change
and they had no idea how to help them.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520
They didn't know how to answer
their children's questions.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.776
What I found incredibly astonishing
and so motivational

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.696
was that these families were
so motivated to support their children.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.136
Despite all these challenges they faced,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.416
they were trying to help their children.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.056
They were making attempts
at seeking support from NGO workers,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.976
from refugee camp teachers,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.216
professional medics,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.440
other parents.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.256
One mother I met had only been
in a camp for four days,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.896
and had already made two attempts

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.336
at seeking support
for her eight-year-old daughter

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.400
who was having terrifying nightmares.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.920
But sadly, these attempts
are almost always useless.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.736
Refugee camp doctors, when available,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.536
are almost always too busy,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.640
or don't have the knowledge or the time
for basic parenting supports.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.480
Refugee camp teachers and other parents
are just like them --

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.600
part of a new refugee community
who's struggling with new needs.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200
So then we began to think.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.120
How could we help these families?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.376
The families were struggling with things
much bigger than they could cope with.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.096
The Syrian crisis made it clear

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.416
how incredibly impossible it would be
to reach families on an individual level.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.416
How else could we help them?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.376
How would we reach families
at a population level

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.960
and low costs

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.840
in these terrifying, terrifying times?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.456
After hours of speaking to NGO workers,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.936
one suggested a fantastic innovative idea

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.976
of distributing parenting
information leaflets via bread wrappers --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.336
bread wrappers that were being delivered
to families in a conflict zone in Syria

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.000
by humanitarian workers.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.976
So that's what we did.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.976
The bread wrappers haven't changed
at all in their appearance,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.200
except for the addition
of two pieces of paper.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.696
One was a parenting information leaflet
that had basic advice and information

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.136
that normalized to the parent
what they might be experiencing,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.176
and what their child
might be experiencing.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.016
And information on how they could
support themselves and their children,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.256
such as information like spending
time talking to your child,

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.376
showing them more affection,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.456
being more patient with your child,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.296
talking to your children.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.896
The other piece of paper
was a feedback questionnaire,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.520
and of course, there was a pen.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.656
So is this simply leaflet distribution,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.496
or is this actually a possible means
of delivering psychological first aid

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.576
that provides warm,
secure, loving parenting?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.680
We managed to distribute
3,000 of these in just one week.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.816
What was incredible was
we had a 60 percent response rate.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.056
60 percent of the 3,000
families responded.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.576
I don't know how many
researchers we have here today,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.936
but that kind of response
rate is fantastic.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.216
To have that in Manchester
would be a huge achievement,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.936
let alone in a conflict zone in Syria --

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.680
really highlighting how important
these kinds of messages were to families.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.136
I remember how excited and eager we were
for the return of the questionnaires.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.656
The families had left
hundreds of messages --

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.056
most incredibly positive and encouraging.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.816
But my favorite has got to be,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.840
"Thank you for not forgetting
about us and our children."

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.336
This really illustrates
the potential means

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.136
of the delivery of psychological
first aid to families,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.256
and the return of feedback, too.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.776
Just imagine replicating this
using other means

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.376
such as baby milk distribution,
or female hygiene kits,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.680
or even food baskets.

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:29.736
But let's bring this closer to home,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.056
because the refugee crisis

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.496
is one that is having an effect
on every single one of us.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.135
We're bombarded with images daily
of statistics and of photos,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.736
and that's not surprising,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.015
because by last month,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.136
over one million refugees
had reached Europe.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.360
One million.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.096
Refugees are joining our communities,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.616
they're becoming our neighbors,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.120
their children are attending
our children's schools.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.840
So we've adapted the leaflet
to meet the needs of European refugees,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.936
and we have them online, open-access,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.616
in areas with a really high
refugee influx.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.856
For example, the Swedish healthcare
uploaded it onto their website,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.576
and within the first 45 minutes,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.800
it was downloaded 343 times --

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.376
really highlighting how important it is

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.936
for volunteers, practitioners
and other parents

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.880
to have open-access,
psychological first-aid messages.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.456
In 2013, I was sitting on the cold,
hard floor of a refugee camp tent

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.560
with mothers sitting around me
as I was conducting a focus group.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.736
Across from me stood an elderly lady

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.216
with what seemed to be
a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.520
with her head on the elderly lady's knees.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.856
The girl stayed quiet
throughout the focus group,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.176
not talking at all,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.320
with her knees
curled up against her chest.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.736
Towards the end of the focus group,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.736
and as I was thanking
the mothers for their time,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.736
the elderly lady looked at me
while pointing at the young girl,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.160
and said to me, "Can you help us with...?"

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.456
Not quite sure what she expected me to do,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.336
I looked at the young girl and smiled,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.736
and in Arabic I said,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.776
"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.000
"What's your name?"

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.456
She looked at me really
confused and unengaged,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.080
but then said, "Halul."

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.376
Halul is the pet's name
for the Arabic female name, Hala,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.280
and is only really used
to refer to really young girls.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.960
At that point I realized that actually
Hala was probably much older than 13.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.080
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old
mother to three young children.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.896
Hala had been a confident,
bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.136
to her children,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.120
but the war had changed all of that.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.376
She had lived through bombs
being dropped in her town;

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.840
she had lived through explosions.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.896
When fighter jets
were flying around their building,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.136
dropping bombs,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.896
her children would be screaming,
terrified from the noise.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.016
Hala would frantically grab pillows
and cover her children's ears

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.416
to block out the noise,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.000
all the while screaming herself.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.776
When they reached the refugee camp

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.016
and she knew they were finally
in some kind of safety,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.440
she completely withdrew
to acting like her old childhood self.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.160
She completely rejected her family --

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.440
her children, her husband.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.320
Hala simply could no longer cope.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.496
This is a parenting struggle
with a really tough ending,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.336
but sadly, it's not uncommon.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.336
Those who experience
armed conflict and displacement

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.960
will face serious emotional struggles.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.760
And that's something we can all relate to.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.920
If you have been through
a devastating time in your life,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.240
if you have lost someone
or something you really care about,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.480
how would you continue to cope?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.800
Could you still be able
to care for yourself and for your family?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.616
Given that the first years
of a child's life are crucial

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.896
for healthy physical
and emotional development,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.896
and that 1.5 billion people
are experiencing armed conflict --

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.616
many of whom are now
joining our communities --

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.536
we cannot afford to turn a blind eye

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.280
to the needs of those
who are experiencing war and displacement.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.256
We must prioritize
these families' needs --

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.120
both those who are internally displaced,
and those who are refugees worldwide.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.096
These needs must be prioritized
by NGO workers, policy makers,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.416
the WHO, the UNHCR
and every single one of us

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.840
in whatever capacity it is
that we function in our society.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.776
When we begin to recognize
the individual faces of the conflict,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.296
when we begin to notice
those intricate emotions on their faces,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.200
we begin to see them as humans, too.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.696
We begin to see
the needs of these families,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.400
and these are the real human needs.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.536
When these family needs are prioritized,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.856
interventions for children
in humanitarian settings

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.160
will prioritize and recognize the primary
role of the family in supporting children.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.416
Family mental health
will be shouting loud and clear

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.200
in global, international agenda.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.776
And children will be less likely
to enter social service systems

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.376
in resettlement countries

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.080
because their families
would have had support earlier on.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.256
And we will be more open-minded,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.096
more welcoming, more caring

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.600
and more trusting to those
who are joining our communities.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.000
We need to stop wars.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.376
We need to build a world where children
can dream of planes dropping gifts,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.640
and not bombs.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.376
Until we stop armed conflicts
raging throughout the world,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.096
families will continue to be displaced,

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.480
leaving children vulnerable.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.136
But by improving parenting
and caregiver support,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.416
it may be possible to weaken the links
between war and psychological difficulties

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.360
in children and their families.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.056
Thank you.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.960
(Applause)
