00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.611
Most of you can probably relate
to what I'm feeling right now.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:07.338
My heart is racing in my chest.

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:10.187
My palms are a little bit clammy.

00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.037
I'm sweating.

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:14.973
And my breath is a little bit shallow.

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.358
Now, these familiar sensations
are obviously the result

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.765
of standing up
in front of a thousand of you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.050
and giving a talk
that might be streamed online

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.242
to perhaps a million more.

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.845
But the physical sensations
I'm experiencing right now

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.014
are actually the result of a much more
basic mind-body mechanism.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.701
My nervous system is sending
a flood of hormones

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.650
like cortisol and adrenaline
into my bloodstream.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:43.998
It's a very old and very necessary
response that sends blood and oxygen

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:46.101
to the organs and muscles
that I might need

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.413
to respond quickly to a potential threat.

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:51.236
But there's a problem with this response,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.716
and that is, it can get over-activated.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:57.424
If I face these kinds of stressors
on a daily basis,

00:00:57.448 --> 00:01:00.041
particularly over an extended
period of time,

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.571
my system can get overloaded.

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:07.264
So basically, if this response
happens infrequently: super-necessary

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:09.540
for my well-being and survival.

00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:11.101
But if it happens too much,

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.867
it can actually make me sick.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.659
There's a growing body of research
examining the relationship

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:18.769
between chronic stress and illness.

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.882
Things like heart disease and even cancer

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.471
are being shown to have
a relationship to stress.

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:27.990
And that's because, over time,
too much activation from stress

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.975
can interfere with my body's processes
that keep me healthy.

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:35.623
Now, let's imagine for a moment
that I was pregnant.

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:38.553
What might this kind of stress,

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.846
particularly over the length
of my pregnancy,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.710
what kind of impact might that have

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.166
on the health of my developing fetus?

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.693
You probably won't be surprised
when I tell you

00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:52.091
that this kind of stress
during pregnancy is not good.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:55.746
It can even cause the body
to initiate labor too early,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.436
because in a basic sense,
the stress communicates

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.643
that the womb is no longer
a safe place for the child.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.710
Stress during pregnancy is linked
with things like high blood pressure

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.393
and low infant birth weight,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.609
and it can begin a cascade
of health challenges

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.796
that make birth much more dangerous

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.825
for both parent and child.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:18.186
Now of course stress,
particularly in our modern lifestyle,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.500
is a somewhat universal experience, right?

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:22.864
Maybe you've never stood up
to give a TED Talk,

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:25.542
but you've faced a big
presentation at work,

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.134
a sudden job loss,

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:28.471
a big test,

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:31.121
a heated conflict
with a family member or friend.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:35.072
But it turns out that the kind
of stress we experience

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.310
and whether we're able to stay
in a relaxed state long enough

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:40.385
to keep our bodies working properly

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.687
depends a lot on who we are.

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:45.296
There's also a growing body of research

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.298
showing that people who experience
more discrimination

00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:51.233
are more likely to have poor health.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.311
Even the threat of discrimination,

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.777
like worrying you might be stopped
by police while driving your car,

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.320
can have a negative impact on your health.

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.446
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.937
the person who pioneered
the tools that have proven these linkages,

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.914
says that the more marginalized
groups in our society

00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:15.745
experience more discrimination
and more impacts on their health.

00:03:16.702 --> 00:03:19.814
I've been interested in these issues
for over a decade.

00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:22.646
I became interested in maternal health

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.415
when a failed premed trajectory
instead sent me down a path

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.908
looking for other ways
to help pregnant people.

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:30.356
I became a doula,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.403
a lay person trained to provide support

00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:34.547
to people during pregnancy and childbirth.

00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.155
And because I'm Latina
and a Spanish speaker,

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:41.088
in my first volunteer doula gig
at a public hospital in North Carolina,

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:44.435
I saw clearly how race and class
impacted the experiences

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.091
of the women that I supported.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.184
If we take a look at the statistics
about the rates of illness

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.011
during pregnancy and childbirth,

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.173
we see clearly the pattern
outlined by Dr. Williams.

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.962
African-American women in particular

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:00.895
have an entirely different
experience than white women

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.713
when it comes to whether
their babies are born healthy.

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:07.572
In certain parts of the country,
particularly the Deep South,

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:10.309
the rates of mother
and infant death for black women

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.853
actually approximate
those rates in Sub-Saharan African.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.441
In those same communities,

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:19.038
the rates for white women are near zero.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.315
Even nationally, black women
are four times more likely

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:26.631
to die during pregnancy and childbirth

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:27.893
than white women.

00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:30.590
Four times more likely to die.

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:34.191
They're also twice as likely
for their infants to die

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.796
before the first year of life

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.351
than white infants,

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.292
and two to three times more likely

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:42.232
to give birth too early or too skinny --

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.166
a sign of insufficient development.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:49.034
Native women are also more likely
to have higher rates of these problems

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:50.256
than white women,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.521
as are some groups of Latinas.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:56.286
For the last decade as a doula
turned journalist and blogger,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.025
I've been trying to raise the alarm

00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:01.020
about just how different
the experiences of women of color,

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:02.499
but particularly black women,

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:05.322
are when it comes to pregnancy
and birth in the US.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:08.242
But when I tell people
about these appalling statistics,

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.997
I'm usually met with an assumption
that it's about either poverty

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:13.672
or lack of access to care.

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.544
But it turns out, neither of these things
tell the whole story.

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:22.080
Even middle-class black women
still have much worse outcomes

00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.683
than their middle-class
white counterparts.

00:05:25.062 --> 00:05:27.570
The gap actually widens among this group.

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:32.073
And while access to care
is definitely still a problem,

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.536
even women of color who receive
the recommended prenatal care

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.474
still suffer from these high rates.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.284
And so we come back to the path

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:44.459
from discrimination to stress
to poor health,

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:48.680
and it begins to paint a picture
that many people of color know to be true:

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:51.110
racism is actually making us sick.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:53.952
Still sound like a stretch?

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:58.260
Consider this: immigrants,
particularly black and Latina immigrants,

00:05:58.284 --> 00:06:01.823
actually have better health when
they first arrive in the United States.

00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:06.412
But the longer they stay in this country,
the worse their health becomes.

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:10.548
People like me, born in the United States
to Cuban immigrant parents,

00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:14.302
are actually more likely to have
worse health than my grandparents did.

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.231
It's what researchers call
"the immigrant paradox,"

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.539
and it further illustrates

00:06:18.563 --> 00:06:20.766
that there's something
in the US environment

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.009
that is making us sick.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.845
But here's the thing:

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.936
this problem, that racism
is making people of color,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.641
but especially black
women and babies, sick, is vast.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.435
I could spend all of my time
with you talking about it,

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.114
but I won't, because I want to make sure
to tell you about one solution.

00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:39.571
And the good news is, it's a solution
that isn't particularly expensive,

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:42.061
and doesn't require
any fancy drug treatments

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:43.271
or new technologies.

00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:45.947
The solution is called, "The JJ Way."

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:49.401
Meet Jennie Joseph.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.972
She's a midwife
in the Orlando, Florida area

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:55.228
who has been serving
pregnant women for over a decade.

00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:57.669
In what she calls her easy-access clinics,

00:06:57.693 --> 00:07:02.314
Jennie and her team provide prenatal care
to over 600 women per year.

00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:07.599
Her clients, most of whom are black,
Haitian and Latina,

00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:09.247
deliver at the local hospital.

00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.648
But by providing accessible
and respectful prenatal care,

00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:16.172
Jennie has achieved something remarkable:

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:20.760
almost all of her clients give birth
to healthy, full-term babies.

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:23.852
Her method is deceptively simple.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:27.052
Jennie says that all of her appointments
start at the front desk.

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:30.816
Every member of her team,
and every moment a women is at her clinic,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.950
is as supportive as possible.

00:07:33.393 --> 00:07:35.795
No one is turned away
due to lack of funds.

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.956
The JJ Way is to make the finances work
no matter what the hurdles.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.974
No one is chastised for showing up
late to their appointments.

00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:45.102
No one is talked down to or belittled.

00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:50.011
Jennie's waiting room feels more like
your aunt's living room than a clinic.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.986
She calls this space
"a classroom in disguise."

00:07:53.692 --> 00:07:56.091
With the plush chairs
arranged in a circle,

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.775
women wait for their appointments
in one-on-one chats

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:00.032
with a staff educator,

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:01.897
or in group prenatal classes.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.284
When you finally are called back
to your appointment,

00:08:05.308 --> 00:08:07.155
you are greeted by Alexis or Trina,

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:09.068
two of Jennie's medical assistants.

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:12.611
Both are young, African-American
and moms themselves.

00:08:12.635 --> 00:08:14.829
Their approach is casual and friendly.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.080
During one visit I observed,

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:20.031
Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:21.926
while she took her blood pressure.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.921
This Latina mom was having trouble
keeping food down due to nausea.

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:28.413
As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,

00:08:28.437 --> 00:08:31.255
she said, "We'll see about changing
your prescription, OK?

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:32.919
We can't have you not eating."

00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:37.760
That "we" is actually a really crucial
aspect of Jennie's model.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:42.543
She sees her staff as part of a team that,
alongside the woman and her family,

00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:43.941
has one goal:

00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:46.450
get mom to term with a healthy baby.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:50.958
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis
are actually the center of her care model,

00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:54.630
and that her role as a provider
is just to support their work.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.624
Trina spends a lot of her day
on her cell phone,

00:08:57.648 --> 00:09:00.060
texting with clients
about all sorts of things.

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:03.961
One woman texted to ask if a medication
she was prescribed at the hospital

00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:05.923
was OK to take while pregnant.

00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:07.624
The answer was no.

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:11.971
Another woman texted with pictures
of an infant born under Jennie's care.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.850
Lastly, when you finally are called back
to see the provider,

00:09:15.874 --> 00:09:18.603
you've already taken your own weight
in the waiting room,

00:09:18.627 --> 00:09:21.005
and done your own pee test
in the bathroom.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:23.868
This is a big departure
from the traditional medical model,

00:09:23.892 --> 00:09:26.780
because it places
responsibility and information

00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:28.533
back in the woman's hands.

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.076
So rather than a medical setting
where you might be chastised

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.552
for not keeping up
with provider recommendations --

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:37.622
the kind of settings often available
to low-income women --

00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:40.629
Jennie's model is to be
as supportive as possible.

00:09:41.177 --> 00:09:44.194
And that support provides a crucial buffer

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:49.153
to the stress of racism and discrimination
facing these women every day.

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:53.375
But here's the best thing
about Jennie's model:

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.931
it's been incredibly successful.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:58.186
Remember those statistics I told you,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.966
that black women are more likely
to give birth too early,

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.142
to give birth to low birth weight babies,

00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.696
to even die due to complications
of pregnancy and childbirth?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.585
Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely
eliminated those problems,

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:13.141
starting with what Jennie calls
"skinny babies."

00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:16.270
She's been able to get almost all
her clients to term

00:10:16.294 --> 00:10:18.901
with healthy, chunky babies like this one.

00:10:19.948 --> 00:10:21.552
Audience: Aw!

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.601
Miriam Zoila Pérez:
This is a baby girl

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.124
born to a client of Jennie's
this past June.

00:10:27.974 --> 00:10:30.568
A similar demographic
of women in Jennie's area

00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:33.464
who gave birth at the same
hospital her clients did

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.076
were three times more likely to give birth

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.439
to a baby below a healthy weight.

00:10:38.857 --> 00:10:41.915
Jennie is making headway
into what has been seen for decades

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:44.133
as an almost intractable problem.

00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:46.774
Some of you might be thinking,

00:10:46.798 --> 00:10:49.419
all this one-on-one attention
that The JJ Way requires

00:10:49.443 --> 00:10:51.778
must be too expensive to scale.

00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:53.258
Well, you'd be wrong.

00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:56.865
The visit with the provider
is not the center of Jennie's model,

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.420
and for good reason.

00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:01.545
Those visits are expensive,
and in order to maintain her model,

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:04.062
she's got to see a lot
of clients to cover costs.

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:07.179
But Jennie doesn't have to spend
a ton of time with each woman,

00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:11.625
if all of the members of her team
can provide the support, information

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:13.524
and care that her clients need.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.745
The beauty of Jennie's model
is that she actually believes

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.984
it can be implemented
in pretty much any health care setting.

00:11:21.008 --> 00:11:23.899
It's a revolution in care
just waiting to happen.

00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:27.845
These problems I've been sharing
with you are big.

00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:31.281
They come from long histories
of racism, classism,

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:34.193
a society based on race
and class stratification.

00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:36.613
They involve elaborate
physiological mechanisms

00:11:36.637 --> 00:11:37.792
meant to protect us,

00:11:37.816 --> 00:11:40.313
that, when overstimulated,
actually make us sick.

00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:43.718
But if there's one thing I've learned
from my work as a doula,

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:47.584
it's that a little bit of unconditional
support can go a really long way.

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:50.477
History has shown that people
are incredibly resilient,

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.384
and while we can't eradicate racism

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:54.670
or the stress that results
from it overnight,

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:57.894
we might just be able to create
environments that provide a buffer

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.780
to what people of color
experience on a daily basis.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.034
And during pregnancy,
that buffer can be an incredible tool

00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:06.227
towards shifting the impact of racism

00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:07.746
for generations to come.

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:09.334
Thank you.

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:12.617
(Applause)
