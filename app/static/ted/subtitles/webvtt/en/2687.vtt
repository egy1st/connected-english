00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.142
Five years ago, I had my dream job.

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:07.057
I was a foreign correspondent
in the Middle East

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:09.221
reporting for ABC News.

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:11.309
But there was a crack in the wall,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.715
a problem with our industry,

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.728
that I felt we needed to fix.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.722
You see, I got to the Middle East
right around the end of 2007,

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:23.003
which was just around the midpoint

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.727
of the Iraq War.

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.200
But by the time I got there,
it was already nearly impossible

00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:30.752
to find stories about Iraq on air.

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:33.775
Coverage had dropped across the board,

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.112
across networks.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:37.192
And of the stories that did make it,

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:40.537
more than 80 percent
of them were about us.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.114
We were missing the stories about Iraq,

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:45.231
the people who live there,

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.163
and what was happening to them
under the weight of the war.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.810
Afghanistan had already
fallen off the agenda.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.475
There were less than one percent
of all news stories in 2008

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.738
that went to the war in Afghanistan.

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:01.705
It was the longest war in US history,

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.691
but information was so scarce

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.950
that schoolteachers we spoke to

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:09.101
told us they had trouble
explaining to their students

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.665
what we were doing there,

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.586
when those students had parents

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.143
who were fighting
and sometimes dying overseas.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.841
We had drawn a blank,

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.647
and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.344
From conflict zones to climate change

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:28.654
to all sorts of issues
around crises in public health,

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:32.074
we were missing what I call
the species-level issues,

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:35.640
because as a species,
they could actually sink us.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:40.383
And by failing to understand
the complex issues of our time,

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:43.741
we were facing certain
practical implications.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.517
How were we going to solve problems

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.812
that we didn't fundamentally understand,

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:50.100
that we couldn't track in real time,

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:52.438
and where the people working on the issues

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:53.805
were invisible to us

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.394
and sometimes invisible to each other?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.624
When you look back on Iraq,

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:03.077
those years when we
were missing the story,

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.863
were the years when the society
was falling apart,

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:09.822
when we were setting the conditions
for what would become the rise of ISIS,

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:12.008
the ISIS takeover of Mosul

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.075
and terrorist violence that would spread

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.600
beyond Iraq's borders
to the rest of the world.

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:21.064
Just around that time
where I was making that observation,

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:22.930
I looked across the border of Iraq

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:25.993
and noticed there was another
story we were missing:

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:27.549
the war in Syria.

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:32.289
If you were a Middle-East specialist,
you knew that Syria was that important

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.558
from the start.

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.122
But it ended up being, really,

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:38.084
one of the forgotten stories
of the Arab Spring.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:41.492
I saw the implications up front.

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.611
Syria is intimately tied
to regional security,

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.582
to global stability.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.495
I felt like we couldn't let that become

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.978
another one of the stories we left behind.

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:58.281
So I left my big TV job to start
a website, called "Syria Deeply."

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.055
It was designed to be a news
and information source

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.428
that made it easier to understand
a complex issue,

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:06.821
and for the past four years,
it's been a resource

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:11.444
for policymakers and professionals
working on the conflict in Syria.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.363
We built a business model

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:16.642
based on consistent,
high-quality information,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.677
and convening the top minds on the issue.

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:23.247
And we found it was a model that scaled.

00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:27.051
We got passionate requests
to do other things "Deeply."

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:30.319
So we started to work our way
down the list.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:34.169
I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:36.775
and we are just one of many start-ups

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.660
trying to fix what's wrong with news.

00:03:39.684 --> 00:03:41.630
All of us in the trenches know

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.129
that something is wrong
with the news industry.

00:03:44.153 --> 00:03:45.368
It's broken.

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.903
Trust in the media
has hit an all-time low.

00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:53.322
And the statistic you're seeing up there
is from September --

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.342
it's arguably gotten worse.

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:57.576
But we can fix this.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.318
We can fix the news.

00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.082
I know that that's true.

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:07.395
You can call me an idealist;
I call myself an industrious optimist.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.944
And I know there are
a lot of us out there.

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:12.360
We have ideas for how
to make things better,

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:16.372
and I want to share three of them
that we've picked up in our own work.

00:04:16.848 --> 00:04:18.637
Idea number one:

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.324
we need news that's built
on deep-domain knowledge.

00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:26.106
Given the waves and waves of layoffs
at newsrooms across the country,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.408
we've lost the art of specialization.

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:31.115
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.386
When it comes to foreign news,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.571
the way we can fix that
is by working with more local journalists,

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:38.976
treating them like our partners
and collaborators,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.843
not just fixers who fetch us
phone numbers and sound bites.

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.083
Our local reporters in Syria
and across Africa and across Asia

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:51.094
bring us stories that we certainly
would not have found on our own.

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:55.334
Like this one from the suburbs
of Damascus, about a wheelchair race

00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:57.831
that gave hope
to those wounded in the war.

00:04:58.243 --> 00:05:00.116
Or this one from Sierra Leone,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.597
about a local chief
who curbed the spread of Ebola

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.844
by self-organizing
a quarantine in his district.

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:09.652
Or this one from the border of Pakistan,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.605
about Afghan refugees being forced
to return home before they are ready,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.086
under the threat of police intimidation.

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:18.759
Our local journalists are our mentors.

00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:20.885
They teach us something new every day,

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.939
and they bring us stories
that are important for all of us to know.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.424
Idea number two:

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:31.087
we need a kind of Hippocratic oath
for the news industry,

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.714
a pledge to first do no harm.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:36.349
(Applause)

00:05:36.373 --> 00:05:37.891
Journalists need to be tough.

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:39.827
We need to speak truth to power,

00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.952
but we also need to be responsible.

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:44.320
We need to live up to our own ideals,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.275
and we need to recognize

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:50.188
when what we're doing
could potentially harm society,

00:05:50.212 --> 00:05:53.266
where we lose track of journalism
as a public service.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.328
I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.

00:05:56.352 --> 00:05:58.748
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.

00:05:58.772 --> 00:06:00.678
But what we saw was a public

00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:04.319
that was flooded with hysterical
and sensational coverage,

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:07.488
sometimes inaccurate,
sometimes completely wrong.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:12.140
Public health experts tell me
that that actually cost us in human lives,

00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:16.837
because by sparking more panic
and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,

00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:19.033
we made it harder for people to resolve

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:21.127
what was actually happening on the ground.

00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:24.195
All that noise made it harder
to make the right decisions.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.237
We can do better as an industry,

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.626
but it requires us recognizing
how we got it wrong last time,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.489
and deciding not to go that way next time.

00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.237
It's a choice.

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:40.559
We have to resist the temptation
to use fear for ratings.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.490
And that decision has to be made
in the individual newsroom

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:45.685
and with the individual news executive.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.364
Because the next deadly virus
that comes around

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:52.169
could be much worse
and the consequences much higher,

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:54.128
if we do what we did last time;

00:06:54.152 --> 00:06:57.728
if our reporting isn't responsible
and it isn't right.

00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:00.743
The third idea?

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.898
We need to embrace complexity

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.640
if we want to make sense
of a complex world.

00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:08.018
Embrace complexity --

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:09.519
(Applause)

00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:14.914
not treat the world simplistically,
because simple isn't accurate.

00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:16.930
We live in a complex world.

00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:19.421
News is adult education.

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:22.900
It's our job as journalists
to get elbow deep in complexity

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:26.961
and to find new ways to make it easier
for everyone else to understand.

00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:28.796
If we don't do that,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.630
if we pretend there are
just simple answers,

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:34.618
we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.

00:07:35.324 --> 00:07:38.775
Understanding complexity
is the only way to know the real threats

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.132
that are around the corner.

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:42.861
It's our responsibility
to translate those threats

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:45.070
and to help you understand what's real,

00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:48.327
so you can be prepared and know
what it takes to be ready

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:49.768
for what comes next.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:52.562
I am an industrious optimist.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:55.146
I do believe we can fix what's broken.

00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:56.861
We all want to.

00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:59.669
There are great journalists
out there doing great work --

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:01.206
we just need new formats.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:05.763
I honestly believe
this is a time of reawakening,

00:08:05.787 --> 00:08:07.476
reimagining what we can do.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:10.045
I believe we can fix what's broken.

00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:12.548
I know we can fix the news.

00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:14.398
I know it's worth trying,

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.565
and I truly believe that in the end,

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:18.207
we're going to get this right.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.399
Thank you.

00:08:19.423 --> 00:08:24.158
(Applause)
