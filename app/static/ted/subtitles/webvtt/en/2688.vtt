00:00:00.978 --> 00:00:04.080
So have you ever wondered
what it would be like

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.678
to live in a place with no rules?

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:08.984
That sounds pretty cool.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.046
(Laughter)

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.707
You wake up one morning, however,

00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:14.211
and you discover that the reason
there are no rules

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.596
is because there's no government,
and there are no laws.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.687
In fact, all social institutions
have disappeared.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.251
So there's no schools,

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.441
there's no hospitals,

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:26.773
there's no police,

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:28.132
there's no banks,

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.710
there's no athletic clubs,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.237
there's no utilities.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:36.076
Well, I know a little bit
about what this is like,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.949
because when I was
a medical student in 1999,

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:43.458
I worked in a refugee camp
in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:46.159
When the war was over,

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:49.241
I got permission -- unbelievably --
from my medical school

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.416
to take some time off

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.611
and follow some of the families
that I had befriended in the camp

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.058
back to their village in Kosovo,

00:00:57.082 --> 00:01:02.449
and understand how they navigated
life in this postwar setting.

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:07.731
Postwar Kosovo
was a very interesting place

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.924
because NATO troops were there,

00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:14.584
mostly to make sure
the war didn't break out again.

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:18.101
But other than that,
it was actually a lawless place,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:21.390
and almost every social institution,
both public and private,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.689
had been destroyed.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.508
So I can tell you

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:32.047
that when you go into one
of these situations and settings,

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.878
it is absolutely thrilling ...

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:37.254
for about 30 minutes,

00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:41.950
because that's about how long it takes
before you run into a situation

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:46.517
where you realize
how incredibly vulnerable you are.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.487
For me, that moment came
when I had to cross the first checkpoint,

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.304
and I realized as I drove up

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:57.426
that I would be negotiating passage
through this checkpoint

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.664
with a heavily armed individual

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:03.074
who, if he decided to shoot me
right then and there,

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:05.428
actually wouldn't be doing
anything illegal.

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.854
But the sense of vulnerability that I had
was absolutely nothing

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:15.776
in comparison to the vulnerability
of the families that I got to know

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.460
over that year.

00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:22.597
You see, life in a society
where there are no social institutions

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.065
is riddled with danger and uncertainty,

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.463
and simple questions like,
"What are we going to eat tonight?"

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.106
are very complicated to answer.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.089
Questions about security,
when you don't have any security systems,

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:40.531
are terrifying.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.318
Is that altercation I had
with the neighbor down the block

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:46.156
going to turn into a violent episode
that will end my life

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.417
or my family's life?

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:50.949
Health concerns
when there is no health system

00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:52.513
are also terrifying.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:56.912
I listened as many families
had to sort through questions like,

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:59.809
"My infant has a fever.
What am I going to do?"

00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:04.103
"My sister, who is pregnant,
is bleeding. What should I do?

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:05.301
Who should I turn to?"

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.455
"Where are the doctors,
where are the nurses?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.240
If I could find one, are they trustworthy?

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:12.997
How will I pay them?
In what currency will I pay them?"

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:15.815
"If I need medications,
where will I find them?

00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:19.739
If I take those medications,
are they actually counterfeits?"

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.262
And on and on.

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:25.317
So for life in these settings,

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:29.821
the dominant theme,
the dominant feature of life,

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:33.788
is the incredible vulnerability
that people have to manage

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.361
day in and day out,

00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:38.219
because of the lack of social systems.

00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:39.479
And it actually turns out

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:43.530
that this feature of life
is incredibly difficult to explain

00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:46.529
and be understood by people
who are living outside of it.

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:51.857
I discovered this when I left Kosovo.

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.086
I came back to Boston,
I became a physician,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.121
I became a global public
health policy researcher.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:00.935
I joined the Harvard Medical School

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.801
and Brigham and Women's Hospital
Division of Global Health.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:05.059
And I, as a researcher,

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:07.737
really wanted to get started
on this problem right away.

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:11.329
I was like, "How do we reduce
the crushing vulnerability

00:04:11.353 --> 00:04:15.124
of people living in these types
of fragile settings?

00:04:15.148 --> 00:04:17.617
Is there any way
we can start to think about

00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:20.346
how to protect and quickly recover

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.179
the institutions
that are critical to survival,

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:24.716
like the health system?"

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.061
And I have to say,
I had amazing colleagues.

00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:30.468
But one interesting thing about it was,

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:32.976
this was sort of an unusual
question for them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.309
They were kind of like,
"Oh, if you work in war,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.582
doesn't that mean
you work on refugee camps,

00:04:37.606 --> 00:04:40.038
and you work on documenting
mass atrocities?" --

00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:42.662
which is, by the way, very,
very, very important.

00:04:43.477 --> 00:04:48.631
So it took me a while to explain
why I was so passionate about this issue,

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.346
until about six years ago.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.435
That's when this landmark study

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:56.568
that looked at and described
the public health consequences of war

00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:57.934
was published.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.895
They came to an incredible,
provocative conclusion.

00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:06.500
These researchers concluded

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:09.998
that the vast majority of death
and disability from war

00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:12.655
happens after the cessation of conflict.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:17.717
So the most dangerous time to be a person
living in a conflict-affected state

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.784
is after the cessation of hostilities;

00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:21.809
it's after the peace deal has been signed.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.394
It's when that political solution
has been achieved.

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:27.952
That seems so puzzling,
but of course it's not,

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:33.781
because war kills people
by robbing them of their clinics,

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:34.982
of their hospitals,

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:36.870
of their supply chains.

00:05:36.894 --> 00:05:40.485
Their doctors are targeted, are killed;
they're on the run.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.428
And more invisible
and yet more deadly is the destruction

00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:47.988
of the health governance institutions
and their finances.

00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:52.357
So this is really not
surprising at all to me.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.340
But what is surprising
and somewhat dismaying,

00:05:56.364 --> 00:06:00.338
is how little impact this insight has had,

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:03.946
in terms of how we think
about human suffering and war.

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.386
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.017
Last year, you may remember,

00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:13.166
Ebola hit the West African
country of Liberia.

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:18.029
There was a lot of reporting
about this group, Doctors Without Borders,

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:20.951
sounding the alarm
and calling for aid and assistance.

00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:25.364
But not a lot of that reporting
answered the question:

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:27.940
Why is Doctors Without Borders
even in Liberia?

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:30.640
Doctors Without Borders
is an amazing organization,

00:06:30.664 --> 00:06:35.079
dedicated and designed to provide
emergency care in war zones.

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:38.458
Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 --

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:41.319
that was 11 years
before Ebola even struck.

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:44.352
When Ebola struck Liberia,

00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:48.003
there were less than 50 doctors
in the entire country

00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:49.889
of 4.5 million people.

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:52.893
Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:56.298
because Liberia still doesn't really have
a functioning health system,

00:06:56.322 --> 00:06:57.989
11 years later.

00:06:58.013 --> 00:07:01.325
When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.882
the outpouring of international
aid was phenomenal.

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:08.577
But did you know that only
two percent of that funding

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:11.443
went to rebuild
Haitian public institutions,

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.227
including its health sector?

00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:15.294
From that perspective,

00:07:15.318 --> 00:07:18.694
Haitians continue to die
from the earthquake even today.

00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:21.920
I recently met this gentleman.

00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:24.022
This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.

00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:27.882
He's the Minister of Health
in the northern autonomous region of Iraq,

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:29.337
in Kurdistan.

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.243
Here he is announcing
that in the last nine months,

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:37.309
his country, his region, has increased
from four million people

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:38.865
to five million people.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.757
That's a 25 percent increase.

00:07:40.781 --> 00:07:44.647
Thousands of these new arrivals
have experienced incredible trauma.

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:49.354
His doctors are working
16-hour days without pay.

00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:53.870
His budget has not increased
by 25 percent;

00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:56.289
it has decreased by 20 percent,

00:07:56.313 --> 00:08:00.954
as funding has flowed to security concerns
and to short-term relief efforts.

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.353
When his health sector fails --

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:05.790
and if history is any guide, it will --

00:08:05.814 --> 00:08:07.860
how do you think that's going to influence

00:08:07.884 --> 00:08:11.116
the decision making
of the five million people in his region

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.959
as they think about
whether they should flee

00:08:13.983 --> 00:08:16.474
that type of vulnerable living situation?

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.664
So as you can see,
this is a frustrating topic for me,

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:22.190
and I really try to understand:

00:08:22.214 --> 00:08:25.738
Why the reluctance to protect and support

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:29.398
indigenous health systems
and security systems?

00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:32.041
I usually tier two concerns,
two arguments.

00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:35.114
The first concern is about corruption,

00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:37.857
and the concern that people
in these settings are corrupt

00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.626
and they are untrustworthy.

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:43.317
And I will admit that I have met
unsavory characters

00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:45.697
working in health sectors
in these situations.

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:49.421
But I will tell you that the opposite
is absolutely true

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.475
in every case I have worked on,

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:55.312
from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo,
to Haiti, to Liberia --

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.435
I have met inspiring people,

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.954
who, when the chips were down
for their country,

00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:03.287
they risked everything
to save their health institutions.

00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:06.659
The trick for the outsider
who wants to help

00:09:06.683 --> 00:09:09.587
is identifying who those individuals are,

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.919
and building a pathway for them to lead.

00:09:11.943 --> 00:09:15.127
That is exactly what happened
in Afghanistan.

00:09:15.714 --> 00:09:19.043
One of the unsung and untold
success stories

00:09:19.067 --> 00:09:21.985
of our nation-building effort
in Afghanistan

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:25.505
involved the World Bank in 2002
investing heavily

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:30.664
in identifying, training and promoting
Afghani health sector leaders.

00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:35.902
These health sector leaders
have pulled off an incredible feat

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.298
in Afghanistan.

00:09:37.322 --> 00:09:41.269
They have aggressively increased
access to health care

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:43.309
for the majority of the population.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.537
They are rapidly improving
the health status

00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:46.832
of the Afghan population,

00:09:46.856 --> 00:09:48.842
which used to be the worst in the world.

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:52.767
In fact, the Afghan Ministry
of Health does things

00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.487
that I wish we would do in America.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.883
They use things like data to make policy.

00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:58.092
It's incredible.

00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:00.508
(Laughter)

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.461
The other concern I hear a lot about is:

00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:05.087
"We just can't afford it,
we just don't have the money.

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.466
It's just unsustainable."

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.152
I would submit to you
that the current situation

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.911
and the current system we have

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:15.973
is the most expensive, inefficient system
we could possibly conceive of.

00:10:15.997 --> 00:10:19.375
The current situation
is that when governments like the US --

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:21.463
or, let's say, the collection
of governments

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.361
that make up the European Commission --

00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:26.034
every year, they spend 15 billion dollars

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:30.064
on just humanitarian and emergency
and disaster relief worldwide.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.409
That's nothing about foreign aid,
that's just disaster relief.

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:39.120
Ninety-five percent of it
goes to international relief agencies,

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:43.481
that then have to import resources
into these areas,

00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:47.894
and knit together some type
of temporary health system, let's say,

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:51.487
which they then dismantle and send away
when they run out of money.

00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:56.111
So our job, it turns out, is very clear.

00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.956
We, as the global health
community policy experts,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.525
our first job is to become experts
in how to monitor

00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:09.996
the strengths and vulnerabilities
of health systems

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.587
in threatened situations.

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.621
And that's when we see doctors fleeing,

00:11:14.645 --> 00:11:16.582
when we see health resources drying up,

00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:19.041
when we see institutions crumbling --

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:20.678
that's the emergency.

00:11:20.702 --> 00:11:23.812
That's when we need to sound the alarm
and wave our arms.

00:11:23.836 --> 00:11:25.230
OK?

00:11:25.254 --> 00:11:26.405
Not now.

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:30.341
Everyone can see that's an emergency,
they don't need us to tell them that.

00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:33.061
Number two:

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:36.422
places like where I work at Harvard
need to take their cue

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.644
from the World Bank experience
in Afghanistan,

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:40.325
and we need to -- and we will --

00:11:40.349 --> 00:11:45.612
build robust platforms to support
health sector leaders like these.

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.173
These people risk their lives.

00:11:48.197 --> 00:11:51.909
I think we can match their courage
with some support.

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.579
Number three:

00:11:53.603 --> 00:11:56.181
we need to reach out
and make new partnerships.

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:58.079
At our global health center,

00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:02.115
we have launched a new initiative
with NATO and other security policy makers

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:07.505
to explore with them what they can do
to protect health system institutions

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.244
during deployments.

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:10.808
We want them to see

00:12:10.832 --> 00:12:15.532
that protecting health systems
and other critical social institutions

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:17.999
is an integral part of their mission.

00:12:18.023 --> 00:12:21.160
It's not just about avoiding
collateral damage;

00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:22.989
it's about winning the peace.

00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:28.308
But the most important partner
we need to engage is you,

00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:31.764
the American public,
and indeed, the world public.

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:37.484
Because unless you understand
the value of social institutions,

00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:40.019
like health systems
in these fragile settings,

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:43.314
you won't support efforts to save them.

00:12:43.338 --> 00:12:45.736
You won't click on that article

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.726
that talks about "Hey, all those
doctors are on the run in country X.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.167
I wonder what that means.

00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:55.043
I wonder what that means

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:59.019
for that health system's ability
to, let's say, detect influenza."

00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:03.230
"Hmm, it's probably not good."
That's what I'd tell you.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.934
Up on the screen,

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:11.238
I've put up my three favorite American
institution defenders and builders.

00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:14.731
Over here is George C. Marshall,

00:13:14.755 --> 00:13:17.584
he was the guy that proposed
the Marshall Plan

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:21.799
to save all of Europe's economic
institutions after World War II.

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:24.652
And this Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:27.822
Her work on human rights
really serves as the foundation

00:13:27.846 --> 00:13:30.874
for all of our international
human rights organizations.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.370
Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin,

00:13:33.394 --> 00:13:36.602
who did many things
in terms of creating institutions,

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:39.393
but was the midwife of our constitution.

00:13:40.582 --> 00:13:42.306
And I would say to you

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.083
that these are folks who, when our
country was threatened,

00:13:46.107 --> 00:13:48.114
or our world was threatened,

00:13:48.138 --> 00:13:49.441
they didn't retreat.

00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:51.806
They didn't talk about building walls.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:57.211
They talked about building institutions
to protect human security,

00:13:58.008 --> 00:14:00.622
for their generation and also for ours.

00:14:01.194 --> 00:14:03.992
And I think our generation
should do the same.

00:14:04.683 --> 00:14:05.843
Thank you.

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:08.096
(Applause)
