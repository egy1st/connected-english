00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.136
Hi, I'm an engineer

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.136
and I make robots.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.656
Now, of course you all know
what a robot is, right?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.856
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.736
and you'd ask Google what a robot is.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.000
So let's do that.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.376
We'll go to Google
and this is what we get.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.576
Now, you can see here there are
lots of different types of robots,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.336
but they're predominantly
humanoid in structure.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.016
And they look pretty conventional

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.496
because they've got plastic,
they've got metal,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.816
they've got motors and gears and so on.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.456
Some of them look quite friendly,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.536
and you could go up
and you could hug them.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.976
Some of them not so friendly,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.456
they look like they're
straight out of "Terminator,"

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.016
in fact they may well be
straight out of "Terminator."

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.776
You can do lots of really cool
things with these robots --

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.416
you can do really exciting stuff.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.376
But I'd like to look
at different kinds of robots --

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.376
I want to make different kinds of robots.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.816
And I take inspiration
from the things that don't look like us,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240
but look like these.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.256
So these are natural biological organisms

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.856
and they do some
really cool things that we can't,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.376
and current robots can't either.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.576
They do all sorts of great things
like moving around on the floor;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.856
they go into our gardens
and they eat our crops;

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.136
they climb trees;

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.376
they go in water, they come out of water;

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.976
they trap insects and digest them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.816
So they do really interesting things.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.216
They live, they breathe, they die,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.056
they eat things from the environment.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.656
Our current robots don't really do that.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.896
Now, wouldn't it be great

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.576
if you could use some of those
characteristics in future robots

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.296
so that you could solve
some really interesting problems?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.376
I'm going to look at a couple of problems
now in the environment

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.136
where we can use
the skills and the technologies

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.176
derived from these animals

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.736
and from the plants,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.856
and we can use them
to solve those problems.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.240
Let's have a look
at two environmental problems.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.376
They're both of our making --

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.856
this is man interacting
with the environment

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.256
and doing some rather unpleasant things.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.920
The first one is to do
with the pressure of population.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.856
Such is the pressure
of population around the world

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.016
that agriculture and farming is required
to produce more and more crops.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.256
Now, to do that,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.656
farmers put more and more
chemicals onto the land.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.816
They put on fertilizers,
nitrates, pesticides --

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.216
all sorts of things
that encourage the growth of the crops,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.376
but there are some negative impacts.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.856
One of the negative impacts is
if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.296
not all of it goes into the crops.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.896
Lots of it stays in the soil,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.376
and then when it rains,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.896
these chemicals go into the water table.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.176
And in the water table,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.696
then they go into streams,
into lakes, into rivers

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.920
and into the sea.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.016
Now, if you put all
of these chemicals, these nitrates,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.656
into those kinds of environments,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.456
there are organisms in those environments
that will be affected by that --

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.096
algae, for example.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.656
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.776
so it will take in all these chemicals,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.736
and if the conditions are right,
it will mass produce.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.016
It will produce masses
and masses of new algae.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.576
That's called a bloom.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.776
The trouble is that
when algae reproduces like this,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040
it starves the water of oxygen.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.736
As soon as you do that,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.680
the other organisms
in the water can't survive.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.096
So, what do we do?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.136
We try to produce a robot
that will eat the algae,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.016
consume it and make it safe.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.400
So that's the first problem.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.456
The second problem is also of our making,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.360
and it's to do with oil pollution.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.536
Now, oil comes out
of the engines that we use,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.896
the boats that we use.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.976
Sometimes tankers
flush their oil tanks into the sea,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.256
so oil is released into the sea that way.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.856
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could treat that in some way

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.600
using robots that could eat the pollution
the oil fields have produced?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.776
So that's what we do.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400
We make robots that will eat pollution.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.216
To actually make the robot,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.440
we take inspiration from two organisms.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.416
On the right there
you see the basking shark.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.976
The basking shark is a massive shark.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.576
It's noncarnivorous,
so you can swim with it,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.056
as you can see.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.936
And the basking shark opens its mouth,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.800
and it swims through the water,
collecting plankton.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.096
As it does that, it digests the food,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.640
and then it uses that energy
in its body to keep moving.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.256
So, could we make a robot like that --

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.816
like the basking shark
that chugs through the water

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.200
and eats up pollution?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.896
Well, let's see if we can do that.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.976
But also, we take the inspiration
from other organisms.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.056
I've got a picture here
of a water boatman,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.896
and the water boatman is really cute.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.496
When it's swimming in the water,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.000
it uses its paddle-like legs
to push itself forward.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.616
So we take those two organisms

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.640
and we combine them together
to make a new kind of robot.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.496
In fact, because we're using
the water boatman as inspiration,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.296
and our robot sits on top of the water,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.576
and it rows,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.816
we call it the "Row-bot."

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.696
So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.416
OK. So what does it look like?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.176
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.416
and you'll see,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.776
it doesn't look anything like the robots
we saw right at the beginning.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.936
Google is wrong;
robots don't look like that,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.176
they look like this.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.976
So I've got the Row-bot here.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.416
I'll just hold it up for you.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.096
It gives you a sense of the scale,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.256
and it doesn't look
anything like the others.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.896
OK, so it's made out of plastic,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.976
and we'll have a look now
at the components

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.316
that make up the Row-bot --

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.721
what makes it really special.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.576
The Row-bot is made up of three parts,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.896
and those three parts are really
like the parts of any organism.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.576
It's got a brain,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.976
it's got a body

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.296
and it's got a stomach.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.736
It needs the stomach to create the energy.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.976
Any Row-bot will have
those three components,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.376
and any organism
will have those three components,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.296
so let's go through them one at a time.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.576
It has a body,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.376
and its body is made out of plastic,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.616
and it sits on top of the water.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.576
And it's got flippers on the side here --

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.096
paddles that help it move,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.480
just like the water boatman.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.536
It's got a plastic body,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.416
but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.336
and a mouth here --
it's got two mouths.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.776
Why does it have two mouths?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.616
One is to let the food go in

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.576
and the other is to let the food go out.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.096
So you can see really
it's got a mouth and a derriere,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.336
or a --

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.376
(Laughter)

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.136
something where the stuff comes out,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.856
which is just like a real organism.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.696
So it's starting to look
like that basking shark.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.096
So that's the body.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.256
The second component might be the stomach.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.176
We need to get the energy into the robot
and we need to treat the pollution,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.736
so the pollution goes in,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.256
and it will do something.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.856
It's got a cell in the middle here
called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.640
I'll put this down,
and I'll lift up the fuel cell.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.056
Here. So instead of having batteries,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.256
instead of having
a conventional power system,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.536
it's got one of these.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.816
This is its stomach.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.096
And it really is a stomach

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.536
because you can put energy in this side
in the form of pollution,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.216
and it creates electricity.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.456
So what is it?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.136
It's called a microbial fuel cell.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.256
It's a little bit
like a chemical fuel cell,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.296
which you might have
come across in school,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.936
or you might've seen in the news.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.096
Chemical fuel cells
take hydrogen and oxygen,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.936
and they can combine them together
and you get electricity.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.376
That's well-established technology;
it was in the Apollo space missions.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880
That's from 40, 50 years ago.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.696
This is slightly newer.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.176
This is a microbial fuel cell.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.456
It's the same principle:

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.896
it's got oxygen on one side,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.016
but instead of having
hydrogen on the other,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.336
it's got some soup,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.176
and inside that soup
there are living microbes.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.896
Now, if you take some organic material --

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.256
could be some waste products, some food,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.776
maybe a bit of your sandwich --

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.616
you put it in there,
the microbes will eat that food,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.520
and they will turn it into electricity.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.896
Not only that, but if you select
the right kind of microbes,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.680
you can use the microbial fuel cell
to treat some of the pollution.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.016
If you choose the right microbes,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.656
the microbes will eat the algae.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.016
If you use other kinds of microbes,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.560
they will eat petroleum
spirits and crude oil.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.656
So you can see
how this stomach could be used

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.936
to not only treat the pollution

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.760
but also to generate electricity
from the pollution.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.176
So the robot will move
through the environment,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.296
taking food into its stomach,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.816
digest the food, create electricity,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.336
use that electricity
to move through the environment

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.576
and keep doing this.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.136
OK, so let's see what happens
when we run the Row-bot --

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.536
when it does some rowing.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.216
Here we've got a couple of videos,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.896
the first thing you'll see --
hopefully you can see here

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.216
is the mouth open.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.256
The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.816
and it will stay opened enough,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.856
then the robot will start to row forward.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.136
It moves through the water

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.256
so that food goes in
as the waste products go out.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.536
Once it's moved enough,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.496
it stops and then it closes the mouth --

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.936
slowly closes the mouths --

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.616
and then it will sit there,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.280
and it will digest the food.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.696
Of course these microbial fuel cells,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.976
they contain microbes.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.856
What you really want is lots of energy

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.496
coming out of those microbes
as quickly as possible.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.096
But we can't force the microbes

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.136
and they generate a small amount
of electricity per second.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.416
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.296
Let's put that into context.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.856
Your mobile phone for example,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.256
one of these modern ones,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.496
if you use it, it takes about one watt.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.336
So that's a thousand or a million times
as much energy that that uses

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.320
compared to the microbial fuel cell.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.576
How can we cope with that?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.456
Well, when the Row-bot
has done its digestion,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.936
when it's taken the food in,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.496
it will sit there and it will wait
until it has consumed all that food.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.736
That could take some hours,
it could take some days.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.456
A typical cycle for the Row-bot
looks like this:

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.736
you open your mouth,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.016
you move,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.296
you close your mouth

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.176
and you sit there for a while waiting.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.576
Once you digest your food,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.416
then you can go about
doing the same thing again.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.416
But you know what, that looks
like a real organism, doesn't it?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.296
It looks like the kind of thing we do.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.376
Saturday night,
we go out, open our mouths,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.936
fill our stomachs,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.896
sit in front of the telly and digest.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.296
When we've had enough,
we do the same thing again.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.176
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.736
at the end of the cycle
we'll have enough energy left over

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.896
for us to be able to do something else.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.936
We could send a message, for example.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.456
We could send a message saying,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.816
"This is how much pollution
I've eaten recently,"

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.416
or, "This is the kind of stuff
that I've encountered,"

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.120
or, "This is where I am."

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.056
That ability to send a message
saying, "This is where I am,"

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.016
is really, really important.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.536
If you think about the oil slicks
that we saw before,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.016
or those massive algal blooms,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.736
what you really want to do
is put your Row-bot out there,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.736
and it eats up all of those pollutions,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.936
and then you have to go collect them.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.176
Why?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.016
Because these Row-bots at the moment,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.376
this Row-bot I've got here,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.256
it contains motors, it contains wires,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.736
it contains components
which themselves are not biodegradable.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.496
Current Row-bots contain
things like toxic batteries.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.496
You can't leave those in the environment,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.016
so you need to track them,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.376
and then when they've finished
their job of work,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.656
you need to collect them.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.016
That limits the number
of Row-bots you can use.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.296
If, on the other hand,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.456
you have robot a little bit
like a biological organism,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.576
when it comes to the end of its life,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.056
it dies and it degrades to nothing.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.416
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.679
instead of being like this,
made out of plastic,

00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:01.296
were made out of other materials,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.056
which when you throw them out there,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.416
they biodegrade to nothing?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.536
That changes the way
in which we use robots.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.936
Instead of putting 10 or 100
out into the environment,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.216
having to track them,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.576
and then when they die,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.816
collect them,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.536
you could put a thousand,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.296
a million, a billion robots
into the environment.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.136
Just spread them around.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.776
You know that at the end of their lives,
they're going to degrade to nothing.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.496
You don't need to worry about them.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.136
So that changes the way
in which you think about robots

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.536
and the way you deploy them.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.416
Then the question is: Can you do this?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.616
Well, yes, we have shown
that you can do this.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.736
You can make robots
which are biodegradable.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.616
What's really interesting
is you can use household materials

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.336
to make these biodegradable robots.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.936
I'll show you some;
you might be surprised.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.856
You can make a robot out of jelly.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.656
Instead of having a motor,
which we have at the moment,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.136
you can make things
called artificial muscles.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.456
Artificial muscles are smart materials,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.936
you apply electricity to them,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.136
and they contract,
or they bend or they twist.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.376
They look like real muscles.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.400
So instead of having a motor,
you have these artificial muscles.

00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:05.256
And you can make
artificial muscles out of jelly.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.216
If you take some jelly and some salts,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.816
and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.616
you can make an artificial muscle.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.216
We've also shown you can make
the microbial fuel cell's stomach

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.656
out of paper.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.160
So you could make the whole
robot out of biodegradable materials.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.360
You throw them out there,
and they degrade to nothing.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.456
Well, this is really, really exciting.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.671
It's going to totally change the way
in which we think about robots,

00:12:28.695 --> 00:12:30.936
but also it allows you
to be really creative

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.296
in the way in which you think
about what you can do with these robots.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.576
I'll give you an example.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.176
If you can use jelly to make a robot --

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.096
now, we eat jelly, right?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.616
So, why not make something like this?

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.040
A robot gummy bear.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.896
Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.520
There we go. I've got a packet --

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.440
and I've got a lemon-flavored one.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.336
I'll take this gummy bear --
he's not robotic, OK?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.576
We have to pretend.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.616
And what you do with one of these
is you put it in your mouth --

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.880
the lemon's quite nice.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.625
Try not to chew it too much,
it's a robot, it may not like it.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.056
And then you swallow it.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.776
And then it goes into your stomach.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.616
And when it's inside your stomach,
it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.856
it does something.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.056
It could go further down
into your intestines,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.416
find out whether you've got
some ulcer or cancer,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.536
maybe do an injection,
something like that.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.416
You know that once
it's done its job of work,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.656
it could be consumed by your stomach,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.376
or if you don't want that,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.016
it could go straight through you,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.256
into the toilet,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.496
and be degraded safely in the environment.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.760
So this changes the way, again,
in which we think about robots.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.016
So, we started off looking
at robots that would eat pollution,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.696
and then we're looking
at robots which we can eat.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.376
I hope this gives you some idea

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.840
of the kinds of things
we can do with future robots.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.456
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.963
(Applause)
