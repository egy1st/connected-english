WEBVTT

00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:05.778
What if I told you that time has a race,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.562
a race in the contemporary way
that we understand race

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:10.136
in the United States?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.522
Typically, we talk about race
in terms of black and white issues.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.402
In the African-American communities
from which I come,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.218
we have a long-standing
multi-generational joke

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.779
about what we call "CP time,"

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.676
or "colored people's time."

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.540
Now, we no longer refer
to African-Americans as "colored,"

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:31.326
but this long-standing joke

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.723
about our perpetual lateness to church,

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:35.429
to cookouts, to family events

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.070
and even to our own funerals, remains.

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:41.930
I personally am a stickler for time.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:44.642
It's almost as if my mother,
when I was growing up, said,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.592
"We will not be those black people."

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:49.281
So we typically arrive to events
30 minutes early.

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:55.075
But today, I want to talk to you
more about the political nature of time,

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:57.018
for if time had a race,

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.380
it would be white.

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.327
White people own time.

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.039
I know, I know.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.935
Making such "incendiary statements"
makes us uncomfortable:

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:12.351
Haven't we moved past the point
where race really matters?

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:15.462
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.017
Shouldn't we go ahead
with our enlightened, progressive selves

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.676
and relegate useless concepts like race
to the dustbins of history?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.772
How will we ever get over racism
if we keep on talking about race?

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.363
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts
of race in a time capsule,

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:36.308
bury them and dig them up
in a thousand years,

00:01:36.332 --> 00:01:38.700
peer at them with the clearly
more enlightened,

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.715
raceless versions of ourselves
that belong to the future.

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:43.791
But you see there,

00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:48.406
that desire to mitigate the impact
of race and racism shows up

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.744
in how we attempt to manage time,

00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:52.828
in the ways we narrate history,

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:55.998
in the ways we attempt to shove
the negative truths of the present

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:57.180
into the past,

00:01:57.204 --> 00:02:00.260
in the ways we attempt to argue
that the future that we hope for

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:02.496
is the present in which
we're currently living.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.531
Now, when Barack Obama
became President of the US in 2008,

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:09.545
many Americans declared
that we were post-racial.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.629
I'm from the academy

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.084
where we're enamored
with being post-everything.

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:18.626
We're postmodern, we're post-structural,
we're post-feminist.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.805
"Post" has become
a simple academic appendage

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.769
that we apply to a range of terms

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.407
to mark the way we were.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:30.487
But prefixes alone don't have the power
to make race and racism

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.271
a thing of the past.

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:34.257
The US was never "pre-race."

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.830
So to claim that we're post-race when we
have yet to grapple with the impact

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:41.752
of race on black people,
Latinos or the indigenous

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.378
is disingenuous.

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:46.951
Just about the moment
we were preparing to celebrate

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:48.346
our post-racial future,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.325
our political conditions became
the most racial they've been

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.691
in the last 50 years.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.962
So today, I want to offer to you
three observations,

00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:00.372
about the past, the present
and the future of time,

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:04.515
as it relates to the combating
of racism and white dominance.

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:06.977
First: the past.

00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:09.689
Time has a history,

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:11.680
and so do black people.

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:14.370
But we treat time as though
it is timeless,

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.798
as though it has always been this way,

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.111
as though it doesn't have
a political history

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:21.345
bound up with the plunder
of indigenous lands,

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.318
the genocide of indigenous people

00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:25.992
and the stealing of Africans
from their homeland.

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.858
When white male European philosophers

00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:33.882
first thought to conceptualize
time and history, one famously declared,

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:37.449
"[Africa] is no historical
part of the World."

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.044
He was essentially saying

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:42.435
that Africans were people
outside of history

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.945
who had had no impact on time

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.618
or the march of progress.

00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:51.548
This idea, that black people
have had no impact on history,

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:55.044
is one of the foundational ideas
of white supremacy.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:59.902
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson
created "Negro History Week" in 1926.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:03.041
It's the reason that we continue
to celebrate Black History Month

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.633
in the US every February.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.130
Now, we also see this idea

00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:13.677
that black people are people either
alternately outside of the bounds of time

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:15.209
or stuck in the past,

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:18.108
in a scenario where,
much as I'm doing right now,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:22.258
a black person stands up and insists
that racism still matters,

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:24.608
and a person, usually white,

00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:25.798
says to them,

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.386
"Why are you stuck in the past?

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:29.259
Why can't you move on?

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.991
We have a black president.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:33.441
We're past all that."

00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.960
William Faulkner famously said,

00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:39.079
"The past is never dead.

00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:40.615
It's not even past."

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:45.085
But my good friend
Professor Kristie Dotson says,

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:48.358
"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."

00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.506
We carry, all of us,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.231
family and communal
hopes and dreams with us.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.962
We don't have the luxury
of letting go of the past.

00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:03.905
But sometimes,

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.914
our political conditions are so troubling

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.127
that we don't know
if we're living in the past

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.244
or we're living in the present.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.943
Take, for instance,
when Black Lives Matter protesters

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:16.988
go out to protest unjust killings
of black citizens by police,

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:20.113
and the pictures that emerge
from the protest

00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:22.700
look like they could have been
taken 50 years ago.

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:25.993
The past won't let us go.

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:30.647
But still, let us press our way
into the present.

00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:33.969
At present, I would argue

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:36.330
that the racial struggles
we are experiencing

00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:39.431
are clashes over time and space.

00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:41.570
What do I mean?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.219
Well, I've already told you
that white people own time.

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:48.917
Those in power dictate
the pace of the workday.

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:52.982
They dictate how much money
our time is actually worth.

00:05:53.973 --> 00:05:56.115
And Professor George Lipsitz argues

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.050
that white people even dictate
the pace of social inclusion.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:02.830
They dictate how long
it will actually take

00:06:02.854 --> 00:06:06.838
for minority groups to receive the rights
that they have been fighting for.

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:10.173
Let me loop back to the past quickly
to give you an example.

00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.244
If you think about
the Civil Rights Movement

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.201
and the cries of its leaders
for "Freedom Now,"

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:19.594
they were challenging the slow pace
of white social inclusion.

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:24.345
By 1965, the year
the Voting Rights Act was passed,

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.999
there had been a full 100 years

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.866
between the end of the Civil War

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.036
and the conferral of voting rights
on African-American communities.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.275
Despite the urgency of a war,

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:37.646
it still took a full 100 years
for actual social inclusion to occur.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.433
Since 2012,

00:06:40.457 --> 00:06:44.134
conservative state legislatures
across the US have ramped up attempts

00:06:44.158 --> 00:06:46.347
to roll back African-American
voting rights

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.846
by passing restrictive voter ID laws

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.435
and curtailing early voting opportunities.

00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:55.802
This past July, a federal court
struck down North Carolina's voter ID law

00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:00.999
saying it "... targeted African-Americans
with surgical precision."

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:06.017
Restricting African-American inclusion
in the body politic

00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:11.033
is a primary way that we attempt
to manage and control people

00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:13.576
by managing and controlling time.

00:07:14.188 --> 00:07:17.756
But another place that we see
these time-space clashes

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.248
is in gentrifying cities
like Atlanta, Brooklyn,

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:24.739
Philadelphia, New Orleans
and Washington, DC --

00:07:24.763 --> 00:07:28.387
places that have had
black populations for generations.

00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:31.703
But now, in the name
of urban renewal and progress,

00:07:31.727 --> 00:07:33.714
these communities are pushed out,

00:07:33.738 --> 00:07:36.332
in service of bringing them
into the 21st century.

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:40.152
Professor Sharon Holland asked:

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:43.843
What happens when a person
who exists in time

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:47.294
meets someone who only occupies space?

00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:50.492
These racial struggles

00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:54.096
are battles over those
who are perceived to be space-takers

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.041
and those who are perceived
to be world-makers.

00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.030
Those who control the flow
and thrust of history

00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:04.627
are considered world-makers
who own and master time.

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.490
In other words: white people.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.375
But when Hegel famously said that Africa
was no historical part of the world,

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:14.904
he implied that it was merely
a voluminous land mass

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:17.049
taking up space
at the bottom of the globe.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.002
Africans were space-takers.

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:24.811
So today, white people continue to control
the flow and thrust of history,

00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:29.378
while too often treating black people
as though we are merely taking up space

00:08:29.402 --> 00:08:30.979
to which we are not entitled.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.657
Time and the march of progress
is used to justify

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:40.096
a stunning degree of violence
towards our most vulnerable populations,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.195
who, being perceived as space-takers
rather than world-makers,

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:47.536
are moved out of the places
where they live,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.608
in service of bringing them
into the 21st century.

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:55.998
Shortened life span according to zip code
is just one example of the ways

00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:58.749
that time and space cohere
in an unjust manner

00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:00.433
in the lives of black people.

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:05.494
Children who are born
in New Orleans zip code 70124,

00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:07.446
which is 93 percent white,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.699
can expect to live a full 25 years longer

00:09:10.723 --> 00:09:14.978
than children born
in New Orleans zip code 70112,

00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:16.909
which is 60 percent black.

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:22.160
Children born in Washington, DC's
wealthy Maryland suburbs

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:25.290
can expect to live a full 20 years longer

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.922
than children born
in its downtown neighborhoods.

00:09:29.672 --> 00:09:32.356
Ta-Nehisi Coates argues

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.020
that, "The defining feature
of being drafted into the Black race

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.948
is the inescapable robbery of time."

00:09:41.698 --> 00:09:43.490
We experience time discrimination,

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:44.741
he tells us,

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:46.245
not just as structural,

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:47.720
but as personal:

00:09:47.744 --> 00:09:49.568
in lost moments of joy,

00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:51.808
lost moments of connection,

00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:54.329
lost quality of time with loved ones

00:09:54.353 --> 00:09:57.429
and lost years of healthy quality of life.

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:03.484
In the future, do you see black people?

00:10:04.524 --> 00:10:07.288
Do black people have a future?

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:10.619
What if you belong
to the very race of people

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:13.390
who have always been pitted against time?

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:18.971
What if your group is the group
for whom a future was never imagined?

00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:21.787
These time-space clashes --

00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.352
between protesters and police,

00:10:24.376 --> 00:10:26.746
between gentrifiers and residents --

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.767
don't paint a very pretty picture

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:32.366
of what America hopes
for black people's future.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.104
If the present is any indicator,

00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:36.179
our children will be under-educated,

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.561
health maladies will take their toll

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:41.384
and housing will continue
to be unaffordable.

00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:45.114
So if we're really ready
to talk about the future,

00:10:45.138 --> 00:10:48.526
perhaps we should begin
by admitting that we're out of time.

00:10:49.994 --> 00:10:52.677
We black people
have always been out of time.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:55.389
Time does not belong to us.

00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:58.609
Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.

00:10:58.633 --> 00:11:01.165
Time is used to displace us,

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:04.199
or conversely, we are urged
into complacency

00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:07.344
through endless calls to just be patient.

00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:10.437
But if past is prologue,

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.714
let us seize upon the ways in which
we're always out of time anyway

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:15.386
to demand with urgency

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.728
freedom now.

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:20.622
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:25.091
But first, we have to decide
that time belongs to all of us.

00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:28.520
No, we don't all get equal time,

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:32.562
but we can decide that the time
we do get is just and free.

00:11:32.586 --> 00:11:35.231
We can stop making your zip code
the primary determinant

00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:36.477
of your lifespan.

00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:39.744
We can stop stealing learning time
from black children

00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:42.824
through excessive use
of suspensions and expulsions.

00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:44.917
We can stop stealing time
from black people

00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:48.260
through long periods
of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:51.943
The police can stop
stealing time and black lives

00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:54.059
through use of excessive force.

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:57.917
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:11:58.424 --> 00:12:02.439
But we can't get there
on colored people's time

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:04.391
or white time

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.227
or your time

00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.000
or even my time.

00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.304
It's our time.

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.335
Ours.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:13.516
Thank you.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.749
(Applause)
