00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Twenty-eight years ago,
I was a broken man.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.640
And you probably wouldn't be able
to tell that if you met me.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.120
I had a good job at a well-respected
academic institution.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120
I dressed well, of course.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.480
But my insides were rotting away.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.600
You see, I grew up in a family
riddled with addiction,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.100
and as a kid, I also struggled

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.896
with coming to terms
with my own sexuality.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.256
And even though I couldn't name it then,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.296
growing up as a gay kid

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.080
just compounded my issues
of isolation and insecurities.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.210
But drinking took all of that away.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.960
Like many, I drank at an early age.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040
I continued to drink
my way through college.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.656
And when I finally did come out
in the early 1980s,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.496
about the only places
to meet other gay people,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.720
to socialize,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.200
to be yourself, were gay bars.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.840
And what do you do in gay bars?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.056
You drink.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.696
And I did --

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.920
a lot.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.120
My story is not unique.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.640
Like millions of Americans,
my disease progressed undiagnosed.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.376
It took me to people
and places and things

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.880
that I never would have chosen.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.016
It wasn't until
an intersection with the law

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.240
gave me an "opportunity" to get care,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.800
that I began my journey of recovery.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
My journey of recovery
has been filled with love and with joy,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.936
but it hasn't been without pain.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.936
Like many of you, I've lost too many
friends and family to this disease.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.896
I've heard too many
heartbreaking stories

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.080
of people who've lost
loved ones to addiction.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.120
And I've also lost
countless friends to HIV and AIDS.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.696
Our current opioid epidemic
and the AIDS epidemic

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.480
tragically have much in common.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.880
Right now, we are in the midst of one
of the greatest health crises of our time.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.616
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
died of drug overdoses associated
with prescription drugs and heroin.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.760
During the 1980s, scores of people
were dying from HIV and AIDS.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440
Public officials ignored it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.440
Some wouldn't even utter the words.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440
They didn't want treatment.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.560
And tragically, there are many parallels
with our current epidemic.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.360
Some called it the gay plague.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.080
They called for quarantines.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.560
They wanted to separate
the innocent victims from the rest of us.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.456
I was afraid we were losing this battle

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440
because people were
blaming us for being sick.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.120
Public policy was being held hostage
by stigma and fear,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.136
and also held hostage

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.760
were compassion, care,
research, recovery and treatment.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.840
But we changed all that.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.056
Because out of the pain of those deaths,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800
we saw a social and political movement.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160
AIDS galvanized us into action;

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.160
to stand up, to speak up and to act out.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.760
And it also galvanized
the LGBT movement.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.456
We knew we were
in a battle for our lives

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.040
because silence equaled death,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
but we changed,
and we made things happen.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.056
And right now, we have the potential

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080
to see the end of HIV/AIDS
in our lifetime.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.296
These changes came in no small part

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.440
by the courageous, yet simple decision

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.600
for people to come out

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.360
to their neighbors,
to their friends, to their families

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.680
and to their coworkers.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.400
Years ago, I was a volunteer
for the Names Project.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.576
This was an effort started
by Cleve Jones in San Francisco

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.576
to show that people who died of AIDS

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.800
had names

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.360
and faces and families

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.800
and people who loved them.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.959
I still recall unfolding
the AIDS memorial quilt

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.480
on the National Mall
on a brilliant day in October, 1988.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.120
So fast forward to 2015.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.760
The Supreme Court's decision to strike
down the ban on same-sex marriage.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.936
My husband, Dave, and I walk over
to the steps of the Supreme Court

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.896
to celebrate that decision
with so many other people,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.296
and I couldn't help but think
how far we came around LGBT rights

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.120
and yet how far we needed to go
around issues of addiction.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.976
When I was nominated
by President Obama

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.176
to be his Director of Drug Policy,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.840
I was very open about my recovery
and about the fact that I was a gay man.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.056
And at no point during
my confirmation process --

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.616
at least that I know of --

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.616
did the fact that I was a gay man
come to bear on my candidacy

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.440
or my fitness to do this job.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.960
But my addiction did.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.136
At one point, a congressional staffer
said that there was no way

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.016
that I was going to be confirmed
by the United States Senate

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.616
because of my past,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.056
despite the fact that I had been
in recovery for over 20 years,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.296
and despite the fact

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.296
that this job takes a little bit
of knowledge around addiction.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.800
(Laughter)

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.576
So, you know, this is the stigma

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.656
that people with
substance use disorders

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.080
face every single day,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.456
and you know, I have to tell you

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.936
it's still why I'm more comfortable
coming out as a gay man

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.480
than I am as a person
with a history of addiction.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.040
Nearly every family in America
is affected by addiction.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.280
Yet, unfortunately, too often,
it's not talked about openly and honestly.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.816
It's whispered about.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.200
It's met with derision and scorn.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.960
We hear these stories,
time and time again, on TV, online,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.200
we hear it from public officials,
and we hear it from family and friends.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520
And those of us with an addiction,
we hear those voices,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.680
and somehow we believe that we are
less deserving of care and treatment.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.416
Today in the United States,
only one in nine people

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.976
get care and treatment for their disorder.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.576
One in nine.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.800
Think about that.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.656
Generally, people with other diseases
get care and treatment.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.656
If you have cancer, you get treatment,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.696
if you have diabetes, you get treatment.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.056
If you have a heart attack,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.780
you get emergency services,
and you get referred to care.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.416
But somehow people with addiction
have to wait for treatment

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.560
or often can't get when they need it.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.760
And left untreated, addiction
has significant, dire consequences.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.680
And for many people
that means death or incarceration.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.587
We've been down that road before.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.816
For too long our country felt

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.160
like we could arrest our way
out of this problem.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.160
But we know that we can't.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.056
Decades of scientific research has shown

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.216
that this is a medical issue --

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.816
that this is a chronic medical condition

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.720
that people inherit
and that people develop.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.400
So the Obama administration
has taken a different tack on drug policy.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.496
We've developed and implemented
a comprehensive plan

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.896
to expand prevention services,
treatment services,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.560
early intervention and recovery support.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.585
We've pushed criminal justice reform.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.360
We've knocked down barriers
to give people second chances.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.296
We see public health and public safety
officials working hand in hand

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.520
at the community level.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.656
We see police chiefs across the country
guiding people to treatment

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.320
instead of jail and incarceration.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.296
We see law enforcement
and other first responders

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.160
reversing overdoses with naloxone
to give people a second chance for care.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.296
The Affordable Care Act
is the biggest expansion

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.576
of substance use disorder
treatment in a generation,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.640
and it also calls for the integration
of treatment services within primary care.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.320
But fundamentally,
all of this work is not enough.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.856
Unless we change the way
that we view people with addiction

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.080
in the United States.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.976
Years ago when I finally
understood that I had a problem

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.135
and I knew that I needed help,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.799
I was too afraid to ask for it.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.520
I felt that people would think
I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.250
that I was morally flawed.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.400
But I talk about my recovery
because I want to make change.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.176
I want us to see that we need to be open
and candid about who we are

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400
and what we can do.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.696
I am public about my own recovery

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.640
not to be self-congratulatory.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.296
I am open about my own recovery
to change public opinion,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.216
to change public policy

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.136
and to change the course of this epidemic
and empower the millions of Americans

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.016
who struggle with this journey

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.000
to be open and candid
about who they are.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.960
People are more than their disease.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.176
And all of us have the opportunity
to change public opinion

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.840
and to change public policy.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.280
All of us know someone
who has an addiction,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.216
and all of us can do our part

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.400
to change how we view people
with addiction in the United States.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.816
So when you see
someone with an addiction,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.520
don't think of a drunk or a junkie
or an addict or an abuser --

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.880
see a person;

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.536
offer them help;

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.280
give them kindness and compassion.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.576
And together, we can be part

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.656
of a growing movement
in the United States

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.760
to change how we view
people with addiction.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.600
Together we can change public policy.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.336
We can ensure that people
get care when they need it,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.040
just like any other disease.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.736
We can be part of a growing,
unstoppable movement

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.776
to have millions of Americans
enter recovery,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.896
and put an end to this epidemic.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.136
Thank you very much.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.536
(Applause)
