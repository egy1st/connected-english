00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.696
Today, I want to tell you
about a pressing social issue.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.056
Now, it's not nuclear arms,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.656
it's not immigration,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.616
and it's not malaria.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.096
I'm here to talk about movies.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.680
Now, in all seriousness,
movies are actually really important.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.656
In film, we can be wildly entertained,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
and we can also be transported
through storytelling.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.296
Storytelling is so important.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.856
Stories tell us what societies value,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.856
they offer us lessons,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.056
and they share and preserve our history.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.680
Stories are amazing.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.376
But stories don't give everyone

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.856
the same opportunity
to appear within them,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.336
particularly not stories

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.496
compartmentalized
in the form of American movies.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.816
In film, interestingly enough,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.416
females are still erased and marginalized

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.496
in a lot of our stories.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.376
And I learned this for the first time
about 10 years ago

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.176
when I did my first study
on gender role in G-rated films.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.776
Since then, we've conducted
more than 30 investigations.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.656
My team is tired.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.056
And I've committed my life

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.576
as researcher and activist

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.296
to fighting the inclusion crisis

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.176
in Hollywood.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.696
So today, what I'd like to do
is tell you about that crisis.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.296
I want to talk about
gender inequality in film.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.696
I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.736
and then I'm going to tell you
how we're going to fix it.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.576
However, one caveat before I begin:

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.936
my data are really depressing.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.016
So I want to apologize in advance,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.176
because I'm going to put you all
in a really bad mood.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.576
But I'm going to bring it up at the end,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.456
and I'm going to present a silver lining

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.856
to fix this mess that we've been in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.456
for a very, very long time.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.416
So, let's start with the gravity
of the situation.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.056
Each year, my research team
examines the top 100 grossing films

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.696
in the United States.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.936
What we do is we look at every speaking
or named character on-screen.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.896
Now, to count in one of my investigations,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.096
all a character has to do is say one word.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.696
This is a very low bar.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.176
(Laughter)

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.616
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.656
from 2007 to 2015,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.536
cataloguing every speaking character
on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920
LGBT and characters with a disability.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.776
Let's take a look
at really some problematic trends.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.376
First, females are still
noticeably absent on-screen in film.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.736
Across 800 movies
and 35,205 speaking characters,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.456
less than a third of all roles
go to girls and women.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.776
Less than a third!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.256
There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.709
and if you compare our results

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:07.376
to a small sample of films
from 1946 to 1955,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.696
there's been no change
in over a half of a century.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.096
Over half of a century!

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.736
But we're half of the population.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.576
Now, if we look at this data
intersectionally,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.736
which has been a focus of today,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.856
the picture becomes even more problematic.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.896
Across the top 100 films
of just last year,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.216
48 films didn't feature one black
or African-American speaking character,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.496
not one.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.736
70 films were devoid of Asian
or Asian-American speaking characters

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.176
that were girls or women.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.816
None.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.216
Eighty-four films didn't feature one
female character that had a disability.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.816
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual
or transgender female speaking characters.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.016
This is not underrepresentation.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.936
This is erasure,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.776
and I call this
the epidemic of invisibility.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.496
Now, when we move
from prevalence to protagonist,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.976
the story is still problematic.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.616
Out of a hundred films last year,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.256
only 32 featured a female lead
or colead driving the action.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.416
Only three out of a hundred films

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.216
featured an underrepresented
female driving the story,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.536
and only one diverse woman

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.296
that was 45 years of age or older
at the time of theatrical release.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.800
Now let's look at portrayal.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.856
In addition to the numbers you just saw,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.496
females are far more likely
to be sexualized in film

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.256
than their male counterparts.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.696
Matter of fact, they're about
three times as likely

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.736
to be shown in sexually
revealing clothing,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.976
partially naked,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.576
and they're far more likely to be thin.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.336
Now, sometimes, in animation,
females are so thin

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.016
that their waist size approximates
the circumference of their upper arm.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.696
(Laughter)

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.136
We like to say that these gals
have no room for a womb

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.736
or any other internal organ.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.776
(Laughter)

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.376
Now, all joking aside,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.336
theories suggest, research confirms,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.736
exposure to thin ideals
and objectifying content

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.576
can lead to body dissatisfaction,
internalization of the thin ideal

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.016
and self-objectification
among some female viewers.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.016
Obviously, what we see on-screen

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.016
and what we see in the world,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.776
they do not match.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.056
They do not match!

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.336
Matter of fact,
if we lived in the screen world,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.960
we would have a population
crisis on our hands.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.856
So, as soon as I recognized
these patterns,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.136
I wanted to find out why,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.056
and it turns out that there are
two drivers to inequality on-screen:

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.176
content creator gender
and misperceptions of the audience.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.936
Let's unpack them really quick.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.896
If you want to change
any of the patterns I just talked about,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.376
all you have to do
is hire female directors.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.416
Turns out, the female directors

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.936
are associated with,
in terms of short films and indie films,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.776
more girls and women on-screen,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.416
more stories with women in the center,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.976
more stories with women
40 years of age or older on-screen,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.896
which I think is good news for this crowd.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.856
More underrepresented --

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.216
(Laughter)

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.456
Sorry.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.256
(Laughter)

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.536
Sorry but not sorry.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.216
More underrepresented characters
in terms of race and ethnicity,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.536
and most importantly,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.936
more women working behind the camera

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.056
in key production roles.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.816
Easy answer to the problems
that we just talked about.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.056
Or is it?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.856
It's actually not.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.136
800 films, 2007-2015,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.736
886 directors.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.376
Only 4.1 percent are women.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.296
Only three are African-American or black,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.800
and only one woman was Asian.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.016
So why is it so difficult

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.816
to have female directors

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.496
if they're part of the solution?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.296
Well, to answer this question,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.520
we conducted a study.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.416
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.856
and asked them about directors.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.696
Turns out, both male
and female executives,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.376
when they think director,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.976
they think male.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.856
They perceive the traits of leadership

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.136
to be masculine in nature.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.336
So when they're going to hire a director

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.656
to command a crew, lead a ship,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.056
be a visionary or be General Patton,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.336
all the things that we've heard --

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.360
their thoughts and ideations pull male.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.296
The perception of director or a leader

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.976
is inconsistent
with the perception of a woman.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.016
The roles are incongruous,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.176
which is consistent with a lot of research
in the psychological arena.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.336
Second factor contributing
to inequality on-screen

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.936
is misperceptions of the audience.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.616
I don't need to tell this crowd:

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.896
50 percent of the people
that go to the box office and buy tickets

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.896
are girls and women in this country.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.136
Right?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.496
But we're not perceived to be a viable
or financially lucrative target audience.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.736
Further, there's some misperceptions

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.856
about whether females can open a film.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.736
Open a film means that if you
place a female at the center,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.696
it doesn't have the return on investment

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.680
that if you place a male
at the center of a story does.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.096
This misperception is actually costly.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.336
Right?

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.656
Especially in the wake
of franchise successes

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.776
like "The Hunger Games,"

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.016
"Pitch Perfect"

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.720
or that small little indie film,
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens."

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.216
Our own economic analyses show
that gender of the lead character

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.736
doesn't play a role in economic success
in the United States.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.056
But what does?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.936
Production costs alone

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.560
or in conjunction with how widely
a film is distributed in this country.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.480
It's not the gender of the lead character.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.336
So at this point, we should
all be sufficiently depressed.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.896
No change in 50 years,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.296
few female directors
working behind the camera

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.360
and the entertainment industry
does not trust us as an audience.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.616
Well, I told you
there would be a silver lining,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.840
and there is.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.976
There are actually
simple and tangible solutions

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.536
to fixing this problem

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.176
that involve content creators,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.416
executives and consumers

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.776
like the individuals in this room.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.696
Let's talk about a few of them.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.176
The first is what I call "just add five."

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.256
Did you know if we looked
at the top 100 films next year

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.496
and simply added five female
speaking characters on-screen

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.936
to each of those films,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.576
it would create a new norm.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.376
If we were to do this
for three contiguous years,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.416
we would be at gender parity

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.000
for the first time
in over a half of a century.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.896
Now, this approach is advantageous
for a variety of reasons.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.856
One? It doesn't take away jobs
for male actors.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.216
Heaven forbid.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.656
(Laughter)

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.616
Two, it's actually cost-effective.
It doesn't cost that much.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.536
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.176
And four, it humanizes
the production process.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.960
Why? Because it makes sure
that there's women on set.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160
Second solution is for A-list talent.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.376
A-listers, as we all know,
can make demands in their contracts,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.096
particularly the ones that work
on the biggest Hollywood films.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.856
What if those A-listers

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.976
simply added an equity clause
or an inclusion rider

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.056
into their contract?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.016
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.736
Well, you probably don't know

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.096
but the typical feature film

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.800
has about 40 to 45
speaking characters in it.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.936
I would argue that only 8 to 10
of those characters

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.976
are actually relevant to the story.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.016
Except maybe "Avengers." Right?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.720
A few more in "Avengers."

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.056
The remaining 30 or so roles,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.496
there's no reason why those minor roles

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.416
can't match or reflect the demography

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.640
of where the story is taking place.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.696
An equity rider by an A-lister
in their contract

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.136
can stipulate that those roles

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.456
reflect the world
in which we actually live.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.016
Now, there's no reason why a network,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.216
a studio or a production company

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.856
cannot adopt the same contractual language

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.696
in their negotiation processes.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.376
Third solution:

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.736
this would be for
the entertainment industry,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.976
Hollywood in particular,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.936
to adopt the Rooney Rule

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.616
when it comes to hiring practices
around directors.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.256
Now, in the NFL,
the Rooney Rule stipulates

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.136
that if a team wants to hire a coach
from outside the organization,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.096
what they have to do is interview
an underrepresented candidate.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.216
The exact same principle
can apply to Hollywood films.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.456
How?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.936
Well, on these top films,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.416
executives and agents can make sure

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.656
that women and people of color
are not only on the consideration list,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.056
but they're actually
interviewed for the job.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.576
Now, one might say,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.016
why is this important?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.256
Because it exposes or introduces
executives to female directors

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.720
who otherwise fall prey
to exclusionary hiring practices.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.896
The fourth solution

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.160
is for consumers like me and you.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.256
If we want to see more films
by, for and about women,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.960
we have to support them.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.976
It may mean going
to the independent theater chain

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.936
instead of the multiplex.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.456
Or it might mean scrolling down
a little further online

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.056
to find a film by a female director.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.936
Or it may be writing a check
and funding a film,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.456
particularly by a female director
from an underrepresented background.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.696
Right?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.376
We need to write, call and email companies

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.258
that are making and distributing films,

00:12:44.282 --> 00:12:47.176
and we need to post
on our social media accounts

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.296
when we want to see
inclusive representation,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.576
women on-screen,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.960
and most importantly,
women behind the camera.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.600
We need to make our voices heard
and our dollars count.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.960
Now, we actually have the ability
to change the world on this one.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.096
The US and its content,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.616
films in particular,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.656
have captured the imaginations
of audiences worldwide.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.880
Worldwide.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.216
So that means that the film industry
has unprecedented access

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.256
to be able to distribute
stories about equality

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.496
all around the world.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.416
Imagine what would happen

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.976
if the film industry aligned its values

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.720
with what it shows on-screen.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.376
It could foster inclusion

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.656
and acceptance for girls and women,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.176
people of color,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.056
the LGBT community,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.856
individuals with disabilities,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.800
and so many more around the world.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.056
The only thing that the film industry
has to do is unleash its secret weapon,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.360
and that's storytelling.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.696
Now, at the beginning of this talk,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.136
I said that films --

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.696
that they can actually transport us,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.080
but I would like to argue
that films, they can transform us.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.656
None of us in this room

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.936
have grown up or experienced
a storytelling landscape

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.456
with fully realized female characters,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.976
none of us,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.736
because the numbers haven't changed.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.856
What would happen
if the next generation of audiences

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.256
grew up with a whole
different screen reality?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.536
What would happen?

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.536
Well I'm here to tell you today

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.616
that it's not only possible
to change what we see on-screen

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.720
but I am impatient for it to get here.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.696
So let's agree to take action today

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.320
to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.256
And let's agree to take action today

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.696
to agree that US audiences
and global viewers

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.856
demand and deserve more.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.456
And let's agree today

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.656
that the next generation
of viewers and audiences,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.856
that they deserve to see the stories

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.016
we were never able to see.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.256
Thank you.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.004
(Applause)
