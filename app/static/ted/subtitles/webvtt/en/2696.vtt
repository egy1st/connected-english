00:00:01.015 --> 00:00:04.008
This story starts with these two --

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:05.290
my kids.

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:06.996
We were hiking in the Oakland woods

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.154
when my daughter noticed
a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:13.309
She looked at me and said,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.840
"Daddy?

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:17.514
That doesn't go there."

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.960
When she said that,
it reminded me of summer camp.

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:21.482
On the morning of visiting day,

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:25.169
right before they'd let our anxious
parents come barreling through the gates,

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.562
our camp director would say,

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:28.895
"Quick! Everyone pick up
five pieces of litter."

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.959
You get a couple hundred kids
each picking up five pieces,

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:34.556
and pretty soon, you've got
a much cleaner camp.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.739
So I thought,

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:40.300
why not apply that crowdsourced
cleanup model to the entire planet?

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.275
And that was the inspiration
for Litterati.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.648
The vision is to create
a litter-free world.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:48.180
Let me show you how it started.

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:51.590
I took a picture of a cigarette
using Instagram.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:54.089
Then I took another photo ...

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:55.670
and another photo ...

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:56.861
and another photo.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.171
And I noticed two things:

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.667
one, litter became artistic
and approachable;

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.395
and two,

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:05.934
at the end of a few days,
I had 50 photos on my phone

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.545
and I had picked up each piece,

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.954
and I realized that I was keeping a record

00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:13.129
of the positive impact
I was having on the planet.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.341
That's 50 less things that you might see,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:16.608
or you might step on,

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:18.090
or some bird might eat.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.421
So I started telling people
what I was doing,

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:23.801
and they started participating.

00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:26.524
One day,

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:29.076
this photo showed up from China.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.310
And that's when I realized

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.600
that Litterati was more
than just pretty pictures;

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:37.993
we were becoming a community
that was collecting data.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.759
Each photo tells a story.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:43.472
It tells us who picked up what,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:45.507
a geotag tells us where

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.561
and a time stamp tells us when.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.435
So I built a Google map,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.512
and started plotting the points
where pieces were being picked up.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:58.454
And through that process,
the community grew

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.117
and the data grew.

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.267
My two kids go to school
right in that bullseye.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.336
Litter:

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.064
it's blending into
the background of our lives.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:11.187
But what if we brought it
to the forefront?

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.123
What if we understood exactly
what was on our streets,

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:15.536
our sidewalks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.098
and our school yards?

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:20.369
How might we use that data
to make a difference?

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.387
Well, let me show you.

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.796
The first is with cities.

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:29.057
San Francisco wanted to understand
what percentage of litter was cigarettes.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.243
Why?

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.476
To create a tax.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:34.208
So they put a couple of people
in the streets

00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:35.593
with pencils and clipboards,

00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:37.680
who walked around collecting information

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:40.815
which led to a 20-cent tax
on all cigarette sales.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.940
And then they got sued

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.140
by big tobacco,

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:48.380
who claimed that collecting information
with pencils and clipboards

00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:50.735
is neither precise nor provable.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.134
The city called me and asked
if our technology could help.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:56.407
I'm not sure they realized

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.679
that our technology
was my Instagram account --

00:02:58.703 --> 00:02:59.742
(Laughter)

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:01.032
But I said, "Yes, we can."

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.072
(Laughter)

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:06.004
"And we can tell you
if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:09.453
Plus, every photograph
is geotagged and time-stamped,

00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:10.858
providing you with proof."

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.059
Four days and 5,000 pieces later,

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:20.021
our data was used in court
to not only defend but double the tax,

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:24.368
generating an annual recurring revenue
of four million dollars

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:26.687
for San Francisco to clean itself up.

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.236
Now, during that process
I learned two things:

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.814
one, Instagram is not the right tool --

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:33.869
(Laughter)

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:35.396
so we built an app.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.053
And two, if you think about it,

00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:40.694
every city in the world
has a unique litter fingerprint,

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:44.554
and that fingerprint provides
both the source of the problem

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:46.499
and the path to the solution.

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.024
If you could generate a revenue stream

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.511
just by understanding
the percentage of cigarettes,

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:54.631
well, what about coffee cups

00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:56.361
or soda cans

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:57.799
or plastic bottles?

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.702
If you could fingerprint San Francisco,
well, how about Oakland

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.422
or Amsterdam

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:06.416
or somewhere much closer to home?

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:08.642
And what about brands?

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.567
How might they use this data

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:14.803
to align their environmental
and economic interests?

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:18.858
There's a block in downtown Oakland
that's covered in blight.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.429
The Litterati community got together
and picked up 1,500 pieces.

00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:25.152
And here's what we learned:

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:28.386
most of that litter came
from a very well-known taco brand.

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:33.315
Most of that brand's litter
were their own hot sauce packets,

00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:38.064
and most of those hot sauce packets
hadn't even been opened.

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:42.680
The problem and the path
to the solution --

00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:46.665
well, maybe that brand only
gives out hot sauce upon request

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.698
or installs bulk dispensers

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.274
or comes up with more
sustainable packaging.

00:04:51.298 --> 00:04:54.267
How does a brand take
an environmental hazard,

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.297
turn it into an economic engine

00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.089
and become an industry hero?

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.494
If you really want to create change,

00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:04.392
there's no better place to start
than with our kids.

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:07.819
A group of fifth graders picked up
1,247 pieces of litter

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:09.691
just on their school yard.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.247
And they learned that the most
common type of litter

00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.505
were the plastic straw wrappers
from their own cafeteria.

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:18.476
So these kids went
to their principal and asked,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.160
"Why are we still buying straws?"

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.921
And they stopped.

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:26.599
And they learned that individually
they could each make a difference,

00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:28.961
but together they created an impact.

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:33.515
It doesn't matter
if you're a student or a scientist,

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.674
whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:39.139
this is a community for everyone.

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:44.653
It started because of two little kids
in the Northern California woods,

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.491
and today it's spread across the world.

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:49.721
And you know how we're getting there?

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:51.945
One piece at a time.

00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:53.723
Thank you.

00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:57.365
(Applause)
