00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.951
Joseph Keller used to jog
around the Stanford campus,

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:09.692
and he was struck by all the women
jogging there as well.

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:13.305
Why did their ponytails swing
from side to side like that?

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.005
Being a mathematician,
he set out to understand why.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.180
(Laughter)

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:20.510
Professor Keller was curious
about many things:

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:22.501
why teapots dribble

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:24.355
or how earthworms wriggle.

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.895
Until a few months ago,
I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.433
I read about him in the New York Times,

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:32.889
in the obituaries.

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.685
The Times had half a page
of editorial dedicated to him,

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:40.631
which you can imagine is premium space
for a newspaper of their stature.

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.710
I read the obituaries almost every day.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.712
My wife understandably thinks
I'm rather morbid

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:52.136
to begin my day with scrambled eggs
and a "Let's see who died today."

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.310
(Laughter)

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.317
But if you think about it,

00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.754
the front page of the newspaper
is usually bad news,

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:00.753
and cues man's failures.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.443
An instance where bad news
cues accomplishment

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.702
is at the end of the paper,
in the obituaries.

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:08.769
In my day job,

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:11.269
I run a company that focuses
on future insights

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:13.713
that marketers can derive
from past data --

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.681
a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:18.247
And we began to think:

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.389
What if we held a rearview mirror
to obituaries from the New York Times?

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:27.982
Were there lessons on how you could get
your obituary featured --

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:29.983
even if you aren't around to enjoy it?

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:31.491
(Laughter)

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.143
Would this go better with scrambled eggs?

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:35.317
(Laughter)

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:39.161
And so, we looked at the data.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.363
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:48.029
over a 20-month period
between 2015 and 2016.

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:52.877
What did these 2,000 deaths --
rather, lives -- teach us?

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.934
Well, first we looked at words.

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.719
This here is an obituary headline.

00:01:56.743 --> 00:01:59.039
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.585
If you remove the beginning and the end,

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.943
you're left with a beautifully
worded descriptor

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:09.642
that tries to, in just a few words,
capture an achievement or a lifetime.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.827
Just looking at these is fascinating.

00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.596
Here are a few famous ones,
people who died in the last two years.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.939
Try and guess who they are.

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:18.403
[An Artist who Defied Genre]

00:02:18.427 --> 00:02:19.612
That's Prince.

00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:22.334
[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:23.518
Oh, yes.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.766
[Muhammad Ali]

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.336
[Groundbreaking Architect]

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.611
Zaha Hadid.

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.591
So we took these descriptors

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:33.139
and did what's called
natural language processing,

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:34.934
where you feed these into a program,

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.823
it throws out the superfluous words --

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:41.070
"the," "and," -- the kind of words
you can mime easily in "Charades," --

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.287
and leaves you with the most
significant words.

00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:45.132
And we did it not just for these four,

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:47.675
but for all 2,000 descriptors.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.442
And this is what it looks like.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.831
Film, theatre, music, dance
and of course, art, are huge.

00:02:56.485 --> 00:02:58.431
Over 40 percent.

00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:00.983
You have to wonder
why in so many societies

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:05.442
we insist that our kids pursue
engineering or medicine or business or law

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:07.053
to be construed as successful.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.564
And while we're talking profession,

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.739
let's look at age --

00:03:10.763 --> 00:03:13.273
the average age at which
they achieved things.

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.143
That number is 37.

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:19.930
What that means is,
you've got to wait 37 years ...

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:23.349
before your first significant achievement
that you're remembered for --

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:24.524
on average --

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:27.026
44 years later, when you
die at the age of 81 --

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.218
on average.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.243
(Laughter)

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:30.951
Talk about having to be patient.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:32.032
(Laughter)

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.145
Of course, it varies by profession.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:35.759
If you're a sports star,

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:37.910
you'll probably hit
your stride in your 20s.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.579
And if you're in your 40s like me,

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:42.594
you can join the fun world of politics.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:43.674
(Laughter)

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:47.613
Politicians do their first and sometimes
only commendable act in their mid-40s.

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:48.894
(Laughter)

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.855
If you're wondering what "others" are,

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.355
here are some examples.

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:54.937
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.843
and the things they're remembered for?

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.619
(Laughter)

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.980
Our curiosity was in overdrive,

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:05.792
and we desired to analyze
more than just a descriptor.

00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:11.944
So, we ingested the entire
first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.742
but we did this separately
for two groups of people:

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:17.543
people that are famous
and people that are not famous.

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.256
Famous people -- Prince,
Ali, Zaha Hadid --

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.515
people who are not famous
are people like Jocelyn Cooper,

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.693
Reverend Curry

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:26.886
or Lorna Kelly.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.098
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
of most of their names.

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:33.934
Amazing people, fantastic achievements,
but they're not famous.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.508
So what if we analyze
these two groups separately --

00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:39.057
the famous and the non-famous?

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:40.500
What might that tell us?

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:41.764
Take a look.

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.025
Two things leap out at me.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.739
First:

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:49.304
"John."

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:50.628
(Laughter)

00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.302
Anyone here named John
should thank your parents --

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.655
(Laughter)

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.761
and remind your kids to cut out
your obituary when you're gone.

00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:02.417
And second:

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.003
"help."

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:09.989
We uncovered, many lessons
from lives well-led,

00:05:10.013 --> 00:05:12.849
and what those people immortalized
in print could teach us.

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:17.611
The exercise was a fascinating testament
to the kaleidoscope that is life,

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.350
and even more fascinating

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:23.442
was the fact that the overwhelming
majority of obituaries

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:26.464
featured people famous and non-famous,

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.921
who did seemingly extraordinary things.

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:32.684
They made a positive dent
in the fabric of life.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:33.945
They helped.

00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:37.363
So ask yourselves as you go
back to your daily lives:

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:40.307
How am I using my talents to help society?

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.304
Because the most powerful lesson here is,

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:47.664
if more people lived their lives
trying to be famous in death,

00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.293
the world would be a much better place.

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:52.231
Thank you.

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:55.103
(Applause)
