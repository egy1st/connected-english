00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.456
I want to introduce you to some
very wise kids that I've known,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.920
but first I want
to introduce you to a camel.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.976
This is Cassie, a therapy camel
visiting one of our young patients

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
in her room,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.280
which is pretty magical.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.560
A friend of mine raises camels
at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.696
He has about eight of them,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.416
and he started 30 years ago

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.560
because he thought
horses were too mundane.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.776
John is an out-of-the-box thinker,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.616
which explains why the two of us
have been such good friends

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.840
all of our lives.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.336
Over the years, I've convinced him
to shuttle those sweet furry beasts

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.320
up to hang out with our sick kids
from time to time.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.856
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.080
that camels have an average
life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.096
The life expectancy of many
of the children with whom I work

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.440
is less than a year.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.575
This is a picture
of the George Mark Children's House,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.096
the first pediatric
palliative respite care center

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.376
to open in the United States.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.376
I founded it in 2004,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.336
after years of working as a psychologist

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.056
on pediatric intensive care units,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.096
frustrated with the undignified deaths
that so many children experienced

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.040
and their families had to endure.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.136
As I sat with families whose children
were at the end of their lives,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.816
I was acutely aware of our surroundings.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.856
While the elevated train
rumbled overhead on its track,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.640
quite literally the room reverberated
with each passing train car.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.856
The lights on the ward
were fluorescent and too bright.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.096
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.120
noisily announcing its arrival.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.856
These families were experiencing

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.496
some of the most excruciating
moments of their lives,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.096
and I so wanted them
to have a more peaceful place

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.680
in which to say a last goodbye
to their young daughters and sons.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.120
Surely, I thought,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.576
there must be a better spot
than a hospital intensive care unit

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.800
for children at the end of their lives.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.320
Our children's house

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520
is calm and nurturing.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.656
It's a place where families
can stay together

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.256
to enjoy quality time with their children,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.016
many of whom are there for respite stays,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.576
some with repeated visits
over a span of many years.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.160
We call those kids our frequent flyers.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.776
Rather than the bright,
noisy quarters of the hospital,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.616
their rooms are calm and comfortable,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.896
with actual living spaces
for the families,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.696
a sanctuary of gardens

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.216
and a wonderful outdoor playground

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.760
with special structures
for children with physical limitations.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.376
This sweet baby Lars

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.360
came to us directly
from a hospital intensive care unit.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.576
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.760
that none of us would ever want to hear.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.096
His parents had been told
that Lars had a brain anomaly

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.936
that would keep him from ever swallowing,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.856
walking, talking

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.560
or developing mentally.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.456
Recognizing what little chance
he had for survival,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.536
his parents chose
to focus on the quality of time

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.040
that they could spend together.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.176
They moved into
one of our family apartments

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.616
and treasured each day that they had,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.120
which were far too few.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.856
Lars's life was brief, to be sure,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.496
mere weeks,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.056
but it was calm and comfortable.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280
He went on hikes with his parents.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.896
The time that he spent in the pool
with our aquatic therapist

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.096
lessened the seizures he was experiencing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.800
and helped him to sleep at night.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.376
His family had a peaceful place

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.776
in which to both celebrate his life

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.240
and mourn his death.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.256
It has been five years
since Lars was with us,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.176
and in that time,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.536
his family has welcomed

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720
a daughter and another son.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.216
They are such a powerful testament

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.399
to the positive outcome that specialized
children's hospice care can create.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.296
Their baby's physical discomfort
was well managed,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.080
giving all of them the gift of time
to be together in a beautiful place.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.296
I'm going to talk to you now

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.536
about the elephant

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320
rather than the camel in the room.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.576
Very few people want to talk about death,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.120
and even fewer about children's death.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.240
Loss of a child,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.656
especially for those of us
who have our own children,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.880
is frightening,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000
more than frightening,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.040
paralyzing,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.120
debilitating,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120
impossible.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.576
But what I've learned is this:

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.616
children don't stop dying

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.616
just because we the adults

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.320
can't comprehend
the injustice of losing them.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.280
And what's more,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.296
if we can be brave enough

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.176
to face the possibility of death,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.120
even among the most innocent,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.800
we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.840
Take Crystal, for example.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.936
She was one of the first children
to come for care

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.360
after we opened our doors.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.936
She was nine when she arrived,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.296
and her neurologist expected
that she might live another two weeks.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.816
She had an inoperable brain tumor,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.576
and her decline had really accelerated

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520
in the week before she came to us.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.216
After settling into her room,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.976
dressed entirely in pink and lavender,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.096
surrounded by the Hello Kitty
accessories that she loved,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.856
she spent the next several days

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.440
winning over the hearts
of every staff member.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.936
Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.376
and then to our astonishment,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.040
she actually improved.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.816
There were a variety of factors

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.416
that contributed to Crystal's improvement

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.000
which we later came to call
the "George Mark bump,"

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.976
a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.896
where children outlive
the prognoses of their illnesses

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.600
if they're outside of the hospital.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.720
The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.336
tasty meals that were fixed
often to accommodate her requests,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.040
the resident pets,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.880
the therapy dog and rabbit
spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.096
After she had been with us
for about a week,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.016
she called her grandmother,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.456
and she said,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.096
"Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.360
and there's room for you to come, too.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.736
And guess what?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.776
You don't have to bring any quarters

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.056
because the washer and dryer are free."

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.256
(Laughter)

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.136
Crystal's grandmother
soon arrived from out of town,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.696
and they spent the remaining
four months of Crystal's life

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.176
enjoying very special days together.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.176
Some days were special because Crystal
was outside in her wheelchair

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.480
sitting by the fountain.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.416
For a little girl who had spent most
of the year earlier in a hospital bed,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.376
being outside counting hummingbirds

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.736
made for an amazing time with her grandma,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.960
and lots of laughter.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.176
Other days were special
because of the activities

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.040
that our child life specialist
created for her.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.016
Crystal strung beads and made jewelry
for everybody in the house.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.200
She painted a pumpkin
to help decorate for Halloween.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.696
She spent many excited days
planning her tenth birthday,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.440
which of course none of us
thought she would ever see.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.136
All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.696
and Crystal, as you can see,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.936
queen for a day,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.480
wore a sparkly tiara.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.376
One hot morning, I arrived at work

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.896
and Crystal and her partner
in crime, Charlie, greeted me.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.056
With some help, they had set up
a lemonade and cookie stand

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.400
outside the front door,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.240
a very strategic location.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.696
I asked Crystal the price
of the cookie that I had selected,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.256
and she said, "Three dollars."

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.135
(Laughter)

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.256
I said that seemed a bit high
for one cookie.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.015
(Laughter)

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.240
It was small.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.016
"I know," she acknowledged with a grin,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.440
"but I'm worth it."

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.896
And therein lie the words of wisdom

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.400
of a young girl whose brief life
forever impacted mine.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.240
Crystal was worth it,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.376
and shouldn't every child whose life
is shortened by a horrific illness

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.600
be worth it?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.256
Together, all of us today

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.536
can offer that same specialized care
that Crystal received

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.216
by recognizing that children's
respite and hospice care

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.600
is a critical component missing
from our healthcare landscape.

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:24.936
It's also interesting to note

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.776
that we are able to provide this care

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.480
at about one third of the cost
of a hospital intensive care unit,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.160
and our families don't see a bill.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.656
We are ever grateful to the supporters

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.120
who believe in this important work
that we're doing.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.456
The truth is that my colleagues and I

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.056
and the parents and other family members

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.056
who get to experience this special wisdom

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.840
are in a unique position.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.096
There are only two freestanding
pediatric hospices in the United States,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.816
although I'm happy to report
that based on our model,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.896
there are 18 others
under various stages of development.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.080
(Applause)

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.456
Still, most of the children
who die in the United States every year

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.496
die in hospital rooms,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.936
surrounded by beeping machines

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.056
and anxious, exhausted adults

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.056
who have no other option

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.896
but to say goodbye
under those harsh, institutional lights

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.960
and among virtual strangers.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.936
For comparison's sake,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.296
the United Kingdom,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.456
which is a country with about one fifth
the population of the United States,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.096
and about half the size
of the state of California,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.520
has 54 hospice and respite centers.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.696
Why is that?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.496
I've asked myself that question
obviously many times.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.016
My best guess is that Americans,
with our positive can-do attitude

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.616
hold the expectation
that our medical care system will fix it,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.120
even though it may be a childhood illness
for which there is no cure.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.856
We go to extraordinary measures
to keep children alive

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.256
when in fact the greatest kindness
that we might give them

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.016
would be a peaceful, pain-free

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.240
end of life.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.216
The transition from cure to care

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.456
remains a challenging one
for many hospital physicians

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.976
whose training has really been
about saving lives,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.600
not about gently guiding the patient
to the end of life.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.176
The dad of a sweet baby
for whom we cared at the end of her life

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.736
certainly captured this dichotomy

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.336
when he reflected

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.336
that there are a lot of people
to help you bring an infant into the world

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.760
but very few to help you usher a baby out.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.200
So what is the magic ingredient
at George Mark?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.256
The complex medical diagnoses
that bring our young patients to us

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.256
mean that their lives
have often been restricted,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.016
some to a hospital bed
for long periods of time,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.896
others to wheelchairs,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.160
still others to intensive courses
of chemotherapy or rehab.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.816
We make a practice
of ignoring those limitations.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.056
Our default answer is "yes"

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.840
and our default question is, "Why not?"

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.296
That's why we took a young boy

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.296
who wasn't going to live
for another baseball season

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.880
to Game 5 of the World Series.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.176
That's why we have a talent show
put on by the staff and kids

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.816
for family and friends.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.896
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy
playing a piano piece with his feet,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.440
because his arms are atrophied?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.040
That's why we have a prom every year.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.200
It's pretty magical.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.656
We started the prom

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.296
after hearing a dad lament

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.800
that he would never pin
a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.616
The weeks before the dance,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.896
the house is in a flurry,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.696
and I don't know who's more excited,
the staff or the kids.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.856
(Laughter)

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.496
The night of the event

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.976
involves rides in vintage cars,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.976
a walk on a red carpet

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.496
into the great room,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.320
a terrific DJ

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.936
and a photographer at the ready

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.496
to capture pictures of these attendees

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.880
and their families.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.936
At the end of the evening this year,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.640
one of our young,
delightful teenaged girls,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.000
Caitlin, said to her mom,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.456
"That was the best night
of my whole life."

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.856
And that's just the point,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.616
to capture the best days and nights,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.720
to abolish limitations,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.656
to have your default answer be "yes"

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.720
and your default question be, "Why not?"

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.296
Ultimately life is too short,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.776
whether we live
to be 85 years or just eight.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.056
Trust me.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.920
Better yet, trust Sam.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.856
It's not by pretending
that death doesn't exist

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.696
that we keep the people,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.136
especially the little people that we love,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.360
safe.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.616
In the end,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.856
we can't control how long any of us lives.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.616
What we can control

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.256
is how we spend our days,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.000
the spaces we create,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.360
the meaning and joy that we make.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.936
We cannot change the outcome,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.880
but we can change the journey.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.120
Isn't it time

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.256
to recognize that children deserve

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.656
nothing less than our
most uncompromising bravery

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.040
and our wildest imagination.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.256
Thank you.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.840
(Applause)
