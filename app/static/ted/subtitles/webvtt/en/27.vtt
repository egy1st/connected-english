WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.216
My name is Lovegrove.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.336
I only know nine Lovegroves,
two of which are my parents.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.176
They are first cousins, and you know
what happens when, you know --

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.416
(Laughter)

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.656
So there's a terribly weird
freaky side to me,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.536
which I'm fighting with all the time.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.336
So to try and get through today,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.416
I've kind of disciplined myself
with an 18-minute talk.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.936
I was hanging on to have a pee.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.296
I thought perhaps
if I was hanging on long enough,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320
that would guide me
through the 18 minutes.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.656
(Laughter)

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.176
OK. I am known as Captain Organic

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.439
and that's a philosophical position
as well as an aesthetic position.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.816
But today what I'd like to talk
to you about is that love of form

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
and how form can touch
people's soul and emotion.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.616
Not very long ago,
not many thousands of years ago,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.576
we actually lived in caves,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.856
and I don't think
we've lost that coding system.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.016
We respond so well to form.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.496
But I'm interested
in creating intelligent form.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.456
I'm not interested at all in blobism

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.496
or any of that superficial rubbish
that you see coming out as design.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.160
This artificially induced
consumerism -- I think it's atrocious.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.216
My world is the world
of people like Amory Lovins,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.696
Janine Benyus, James Watson.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.336
I'm in that world,
but I work purely instinctively.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.096
I'm not a scientist.
I could have been, perhaps,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.936
but I work in this world
where I trust my instincts.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.616
So I am a 21st-century
translator of technology

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.776
into products that we use everyday
and relate beautifully and naturally with.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.536
And we should be developing things --
we should be developing packaging

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.416
for ideas which elevate
people's perceptions

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.936
and respect for the things
that we dig out of the earth

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.216
and translate into products
for everyday use.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.696
So, the water bottle.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.376
I'll begin with this concept
of what I call DNA.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.576
DNA: Design, Nature, Art.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.981
These are the three things
that condition my world.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:16.496
Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,
500 years ago, before photography.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.576
It shows how observation,
curiosity and instinct

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.816
work to create amazing art.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.616
Industrial design is the art form
of the 21st century.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.176
People like Leonardo --
there have not been many --

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.816
had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.336
I work from a similar position.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.503
I don't want to sound
pretentious saying that,

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:42.296
but this is my drawing made
on a digital pad a couple of years ago --

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.656
well into the 21st century,
500 years later.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.656
It's my impression of water.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.204
Impressionism being the most valuable
art form on the planet as we know it:

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:53.576
100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.456
I use, now, a whole new process.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.456
A few years ago I reinvented my process

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.016
to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,
Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.376
all these people that I think
are persevering and pioneering

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.416
with fantastic new ideas
of how to create form.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.936
This is all created digitally.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.216
Here you see the machining,
the milling of a block of acrylic.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.479
This is what I show to the client to say,
"That's what I want to do."

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:20.027
At that point, I don't know
if that's possible at all.

00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.508
It's a seductor, but I just feel
in my bones that that's possible.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.136
So we go, we look at the tooling.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.776
We look at how that is produced.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.753
These are the invisible things
that you never see in your life.

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:35.336
This is the background noise
of industrial design.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.176
That is like an Anish Kapoor
flowing through a Richard Serra.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.439
It is more valuable
than the product in my eyes.

00:03:41.463 --> 00:03:42.845
I don't have one.

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.757
When I do make some money,
I'll have one machined for myself.

00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.034
This is the final product.

00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:49.275
When they sent it to me,
I thought I'd failed.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.656
It felt like nothing.
It has to feel like nothing.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.216
It was when I put the water in

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.896
that I realized that I'd put
a skin on water itself.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.936
It's an icon of water itself,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.776
and it elevates people's perception
of contemporary design.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.136
Each bottle is different,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.780
meaning the water level
will give you a different shape.

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:08.816
It's mass individualism
from a single product.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.056
It fits the hand.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.416
It fits arthritic hands.
It fits children's hands.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.583
It makes the product strong,
the tessellation.

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:16.896
It's a millefiori of ideas.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.656
In the future, they will look like that,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.307
because we need to move away
from those type of polymers

00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.958
and use that for medical equipment

00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:26.038
and more important things,
perhaps, in life.

00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:28.736
Biopolymers, these new
ideas for materials,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.176
will come into play in probably a decade.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.776
It doesn't look as cool, does it?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.856
But I can live up to that.
I don't have a problem with that.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.560
I design for that condition,
biopolymers. It's the future.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.176
I took this video in Cape Town last year.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.936
This is the freaky side coming out.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.496
I have this special interest
in things like this, which blow my mind.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.456
I don't know whether to,
you know, drop to my knees, cry;

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.736
I don't know what I think.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.760
But I just know that nature --

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.096
nature improves with ever-greater purpose

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.056
that which once existed,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.216
and that strangeness
is a consequence of innovative thinking.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.496
When I look at these things,
they look pretty normal to me.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.901
But these things evolved over many years,
and what we're trying to do --

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:18.096
I get three weeks to design a telephone.
How the hell do I do that,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.716
when you get these things that take
hundreds of millions of years to evolve?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.136
How do you condense that?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.696
It comes back to instinct.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.656
I'm not talking about designing
telephones that look like that

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.300
and I'm not looking
at designing architecture like that.

00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:32.536
I'm just interested
in natural growth patterns

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.736
and the beautiful forms
that only nature really creates.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.536
How that flows through me
and how that comes out

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.176
is what I'm trying to understand.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.096
This is a scan through the human forearm.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.136
It's then blown up
through rapid prototyping

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.736
to reveal its cellular structure.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.256
I have these in my office.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.296
My office is a mixture
of the Natural History Museum

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.976
and a NASA space lab.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.816
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.936
This is one of my specimens.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.176
This is made --

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.976
bone is made from a mixture
of inorganic minerals and polymers.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.736
I studied cooking in school
for four years, and in that experience,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.475
which was called "domestic science,"

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.071
it was a bit of a cheap trick for me
to try and get a science qualification.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.656
(Laughter)

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.376
Actually, I put marijuana
in everything I cooked --

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.616
(Laughter)

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.260
And I had access to all
the best girls. It was fabulous.

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:28.665
All the guys in the rugby team
couldn't understand.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.256
Anyway -- this is a meringue.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.736
This is another sample I have.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.136
A meringue is made exactly the same way,
in my estimation, as a bone.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.816
It's made from
polysaccharides and proteins.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.016
If you pour water on that, it dissolves.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.696
Could we be manufacturing
from foodstuffs in the future?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.496
Not a bad idea. I don't know.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.282
I need to talk to Janine
and a few other people about that,

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:53.096
but I believe instinctively that
that meringue can become something,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.320
a car -- I don't know.

00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:57.176
I'm also interested in growth patterns:

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.696
the unbridled way that nature grows things

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.296
so you're not restricted by form at all.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.976
These interrelated forms,
they do inspire everything I do,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.456
although I might end up
making something incredibly simple.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.696
This is a detail of a chair
that I've designed in magnesium.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.776
It shows this interlocution of elements
and the beauty of, kind of, engineering

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.785
and biological thinking,

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.896
shown pretty much as a bone structure.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.736
Any one of those elements
you could sort of hang on the wall

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.416
as some kind of art object.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.216
It's the world's first chair
made in magnesium.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.296
It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.296
It's called "Go," by Bernhardt, USA.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.056
It went into Time magazine in 2001
as the new language of the 21st century.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.880
Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales
in a little village, that's enough.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.176
It shows how you make one holistic form,
like the car industry,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.915
and then you break up what you need.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.136
This is an absolutely
beautiful way of working.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.416
It's a godly way of working.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.696
It's organic and it's essential.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.387
It's an absolutely fat-free design,

00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:04.296
and when you look at it,
you see human beings.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.749
When that moves into polymers,

00:08:05.773 --> 00:08:10.136
you can change the elasticity,
the fluidity of the form.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.776
This is an idea for a gas-injected,
one-piece polymer chair.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.576
What nature does
is it drills holes in things.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.816
It liberates form.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.936
It takes away anything extraneous.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.176
That's what I do.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.616
I make organic things which are essential.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.736
And they look funky, too --
but I don't set out to make funky things

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.816
because I think
that's an absolute disgrace.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.936
I set out to look at natural forms.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.936
If you took the idea of fractal technology
further, take a membrane,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.655
shrinking it down constantly
like nature does --

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.256
that could be a seat for a chair.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.056
It could be a sole for a sports shoe.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.936
It could be a car blending into seats.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.616
Wow. Let's go for it.
That's the kind of stuff.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.456
This is what exists in nature.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.416
Observation now allows us
to bring that natural process

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.456
into the design process every day.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.696
That's what I do.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.776
This is a show
that's currently on in Tokyo.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.456
It's called "Superliquidity."
It's my sculptural investigation.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.136
It's like 21st-century Henry Moore.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.976
When you see a Henry Moore, still,
your hair stands up.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.216
There's some amazing spiritual connect.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.136
If he was a car designer,
phew, we'd all be driving one.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.336
In his day, he was
the highest taxpayer in Britain.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.736
That is the power of organic design.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.160
It contributes immensely to our --

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.256
sense of being,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.138
our sense of relationships with things,

00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:32.336
our sensuality and,
you know, the sort of --

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.376
even the sort of socio-erotic side,
which is very important.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.896
This is my artwork.
This is all my process.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.936
These actually are sold as artwork.
They're very big prints.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.456
But this is how I get to that object.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.656
Ironically, that object was made
by the Killarney process,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.296
which is a brand-new process here
for the 21st century,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.336
and I can hear Greg Lynn
laughing his socks off as I say that.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.056
I'll tell you about that later.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.856
When I look into these data images,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.616
I see new things.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.216
It's self-inspired.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.096
Diatomic structures, radiolaria,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.549
the things that we couldn't see
but we can do now --

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:09.909
these, again, are cored out.

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:13.336
They're made virtually from nothing.
They're made from silica.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.536
Why not structures from cars like that?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.656
Coral, all these natural forces,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.856
take away what they don't need
and they deliver maximum beauty.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.136
We need to be in that realm.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.536
I want to do stuff like that.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.608
This is a new chair which should
come on the market in September.

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:35.456
It's for a company called Moroso in Italy.
It's a gas-injected polymer chair.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.136
Those holes you see there
are very filtered-down,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.176
watered-down versions of the extremity
of the diatomic structures.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.724
It goes with the flow
of the polymer and you'll see --

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:47.736
there's an image coming up
right now that shows the full thing.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.656
It's great to have companies in Italy
who support this way of dreaming.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.831
If you see the shadows
that come through that,

00:10:53.855 --> 00:10:56.577
they're actually probably
more important than the product,

00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:58.038
but it's the minimum it takes.

00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:00.336
The coring out of the back
lets you breathe.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.313
It takes away any material you don't need

00:11:02.337 --> 00:11:04.617
and it actually garners flexure too.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.416
I was going to break into a dance then.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.376
This is some current work I'm doing.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.456
I'm looking at single-surface structures

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.176
and how they stretch and flow.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.680
It's based on furniture typologies,
but that's not the end motivation.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.640
It's made from aluminum ...

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.056
as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.296
It's grown in my mind,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.896
and then it's grown in terms
of the whole process that I go through.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.576
This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,
who build parts for Bentleys and so on.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.776
It's being built as we speak

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.776
and it will be on show in Phillips
next year in New York.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.656
I have a big show
with Phillips Auctioneers.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.656
When I see these animations,
oh Jesus, I'm blown away.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.696
This is what goes on
in my studio everyday.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.496
I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.854
Some guy's got that on a computer --
there's this like, oh my goodness.

00:11:56.878 --> 00:12:00.616
So I try to create this energy
of invention every day in my studio.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.656
This kind of effervescent --

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.256
fully charged sense of soup
that delivers ideas.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.256
Single-surface products.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.976
Furniture's a good one.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.816
How you grow legs out of a surface.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.460
I would love to build this one day

00:12:16.484 --> 00:12:19.456
and perhaps I'd like
to build it also out of flour, sugar,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.096
polymer, wood chips --
I don't know, human hair.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.816
I don't know. I'd love a go at that.
I don't know. If I just got some time.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.656
That's the weird side coming out again.
A lot of companies don't understand that.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.376
Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.797
They said, "Give us the dream.
What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"

00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:39.020
I said, "You don't copy Apple,
that's for sure.

00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:40.304
You get into biopolymers."

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.963
They looked straight through me.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.736
What a waste. Anyway.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.976
(Laughter)

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.216
No, it's true. Fuck them.
You know, I mean --

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.576
(Laughter)

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.816
I'm delivering; they're not taking.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.376
I've had this image 20 years.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.016
I've had this image of a water droplet
for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.816
That is an image of a car for me.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.221
That's the car of the future.
It's a water droplet.

00:13:02.245 --> 00:13:04.816
I've been banging on about this
like I can't believe.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.056
Cars are all wrong.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.319
I'm going to show you
something a bit weird now.

00:13:08.343 --> 00:13:10.936
They laughed everywhere
over the world I showed this.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.016
The only place
that didn't laugh was Moscow.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.856
Cars are made from 30,000 components.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.536
How ridiculous is that?
Couldn't you make that from 300?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.696
It's got a vacuum-formed,
carbon-nylon pan.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.252
Everything's holistically integrated.
It opens and closes like a bread bin.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:29.759
There is no engine.
There's a solar panel on the back

00:13:29.783 --> 00:13:33.083
and there are batteries in the wheels;
they're fitted like Formula 1.

00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:35.917
You take them off your wall,
you plug them in. Off you go.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.656
A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.919
transparent, so you can see
the people in there.

00:13:40.943 --> 00:13:42.420
You drive different.

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:44.616
You see that thing. You do. You do.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.336
And not anesthetized, separated from life.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.656
There's a hole at the front
and there's a reason for that.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.096
It's a city car.
You drive along. You get out.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.720
You drive on to a proboscis. You get out.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.176
It lifts you up.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.716
It presents the solar panel to the sun,
and at night, it's a street lamp.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.896
(Applause)

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.968
That's what happens if you get inspired
by the street lamp first,

00:14:09.992 --> 00:14:11.176
and do the car second.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.816
I can see these bubbles
with these hydrogen packages,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.616
floating around
on the ground, driven by AI.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.315
When I showed this in South Africa,

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:23.442
everybody afterwards was going,
"Hey, car on a stick. Like this."

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:25.126
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.336
(Laughter)

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.976
If you put it next to
contemporary architecture,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.536
it feels totally natural to me.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.418
And that's what I do with my furniture.

00:14:32.442 --> 00:14:35.576
I'm not putting Charles Eames'
furniture in buildings anymore.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.193
I'm trying to build furniture
which fits architecture.

00:14:38.217 --> 00:14:40.224
I'm trying to build
transportation systems.

00:14:40.248 --> 00:14:42.542
I work on aircraft for Airbus,

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.856
I do all this sort of stuff

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.656
trying to force these natural,
inspired-by-nature dreams home.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.456
I'm going to finish on two things.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.976
This is the stereolithography
of a staircase.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.760
It's a little bit of a dedication
to James, James Watson.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.496
I built this thing for my studio.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.736
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.656
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.896
I built this.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.696
This is the data that goes with that.
Incredibly complex.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.536
Took about two years,
because I'm looking for fat-free design.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.160
Lean, efficient things. Healthy products.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.536
This is built by composites.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.176
It's a single element which rotates around
to create a holistic element,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.016
and this is a carbon-fiber handrail
which is only supported in two places.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.936
Modern materials
allow us to do modern things.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.576
This is a shot in the studio.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.136
This is how it looks
pretty much every day.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.936
You wouldn't want to have
a fear of heights coming down it.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.336
There is virtually no handrail.
It doesn't pass any standards.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.416
(Laughter)

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.656
Who cares?

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.096
(Laughter)

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.978
And it has an internal handrail
which gives it its strength.

00:15:49.002 --> 00:15:52.193
It's this holistic integration.
That's my studio. It's subterranean.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.536
It's in Notting Hill,
next to all the crap --

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.256
the prostitutes and all that stuff.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.416
It's next to David Hockney's
original studio.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.115
It has a lighting system
that changes throughout the day.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:04.004
My guys go out for lunch.
The door's open. They come back in,

00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:06.963
because it's normally raining
and they prefer to stay in.

00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:08.172
This is my studio.

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:10.416
Elephant skull
from Oxford University, 1988.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.060
I bought that last year.
They're very difficult to find.

00:16:13.084 --> 00:16:15.656
If anybody's got a whale skeleton
they want to sell me,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.216
I'll put it in the studio.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.576
So I'm just going
to interject a little bit

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.336
with some of the things
that you'll see in the video.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.656
It's a homemade video, made it myself
at three o'clock in the morning

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.096
just to show you how my real world is.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.336
You never see that.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.503
You never see architects or designers
showing you their real world.

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:33.816
This is called a "Plasnet."

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.696
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair
I'm doing in Italy.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.696
World's first bamboo bike
with folding handlebars.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.496
We should all be riding one of these.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.616
As China buys all these crappy cars,
we should be riding things like this.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.840
Counterbalance.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.576
Like I say, it's a cross

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.816
between Natural History Museum
and a NASA laboratory.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.016
It's full of prototypes and objects.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.710
It's self-inspirational, again.

00:16:57.734 --> 00:16:59.609
I mean, the rare times when I'm there,

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:01.216
I do enjoy it.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.096
And I get lots and lots of kids coming.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:10.336
I'm a contaminator for all those children
of investment bankers -- wankers.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.576
Sorry.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.536
(Laughter)

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.376
That's a solar seed.
It's a concept for new architecture.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.136
That thing on the top is the world's
first solar-powered garden lamp --

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.896
the first produced.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.096
Giles Revell should be
talking here today --

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.336
amazing photography
of things you can't see.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:30.360
The first sculptural model
I made for that thing in Tokyo.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.776
Lots of stuff.
There's a little leaf chair --

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.800
that golden looking thing
is called "Leaf."

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:38.376
It's made from Kevlar.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.536
On the wall is my book
called "Supernatural,"

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.418
which allows me to remember
what I've done, because I forget.

00:17:43.442 --> 00:17:46.016
There's an aerated brick
I did in Limoges last year,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.480
in Concepts for New Ceramics
in Architecture.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.976
Gernot Oberfell, working
at three o'clock in the morning --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.400
and I don't pay overtime.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.976
Overtime is the passion of design,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.776
so join the club or don't.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.336
(Laughter)

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.360
No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg --

00:18:06.384 --> 00:18:08.765
we're traveling like you can't --
we fit it all in.

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:10.576
I don't know how we do it.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.856
Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden,
then I'm in Beijing on Friday.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.416
You work that one out.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.616
And when I see Ed's photographs,
I think, why the hell am I going to China?

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.856
It's true. It's true.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.016
Because there's a soul
in this whole thing.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.536
We need to have a new instinct
for the 21st century.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.856
We need to combine all this stuff.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.576
If all the people who were
talking over this period

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.816
worked on a car together,

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.520
it would be a joy, absolute joy.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.880
So there's a new X-light system
I'm doing in Japan.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.696
There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa.
There's a Kifwebe mask.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.280
These are my sculptures.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.936
A copper jelly mold.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.696
(Laughter)

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.292
It sounds like some quiz show
or something, doesn't it?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.640
So, it's going to end.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.280
Thank you, James,
for your great inspiration.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.616
Thank you very much.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.240
(Applause)
