WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, can we dare to be optimistic?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is that a billion people have been stuck living

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that have not offered credible hope.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That is a human tragedy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
continues for another 40 years,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
combined with social integration globally,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it will build a nightmare for our children.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We need compassion to get ourselves started,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That's the alliance that changes the world.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What can we actually do?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Well, a good guide is to think,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"What did we do last time the rich world got serious

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
about developing another region of the world?"

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
except you have to go back quite a long time.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The last time the rich world got serious

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
about developing another region was in the late 1940s.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The rich world was you, America,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That was post-War Europe.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Why did America get serious?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It was that you knew you had to,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Europe had to be dragged into economic development.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, what did you do, last time you got serious?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But what else did you do?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
After the war, you opened your markets to Europe,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and you institutionalized that trade liberalization

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, total reversal of trade policy.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Did you do anything else?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
for over 40 years.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
national sovereignty.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
After the war, you found the United Nations,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
all systems for mutual government support.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
That is still the waterfront of effective policies:

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
aid, trade, security, governments.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Of course, the details of policy are going to be different,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
because the challenge is different.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Is that easier or harder?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We need to be at least as serious as we were then.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
governments, mutual systems of support for governments --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and I'm going to show you one idea

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in how we could do something to strengthen governance,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The opportunity we're going to look to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and that is the commodity booms.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Ghana has discovered oil;

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So, a mass of new discoveries.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Just to give you one example:

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to the bottom billion are without precedent.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So there's the optimism.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The question is, how is it going to help their development?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Will it be taken?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I've looked to see what is the relationship between

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
higher commodity prices of exports,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
for the last 40 years,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and looked to see what the relationship is.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but also that drives up output across the board.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And how about the long run?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Come back 15 years later.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You go up in the short run, but then most societies

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
for growth of an increase in prices.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
that the critical issue is the level of governance,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the initial level of economic governance,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
when the resource booms accrue.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
In fact, if you've got good enough governance,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
there is no resource boom.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
below a threshold of governance.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
They still go up in the short run.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The best growth rates they've had -- ever.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And the question is whether the short run will persist.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and below which you go down.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Just to benchmark that threshold,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and that is the spread of democracy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which has transformed governance in the bottom billion.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and unfortunately, they're adverse.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Laughter)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that's doing the damage with democracy,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
is very strong checks and balances.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They haven't got them.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They got instant democracy in the 1990s:

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
elections without checks and balances.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
In all the societies of the bottom billion,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
there are intense struggles to do just that.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that need to be taken in order

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to harness these resource revenues.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
We know these international standards work

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
because we've already got one.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
That is the very simple idea that governments should report

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to their citizens what revenues they have.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
No sooner was it proposed

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
People wanted to know what their government was getting

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
in terms of revenue.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and putting assets on top of the ground.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
how they've been sold over the last 40 years?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And that's great for the company,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and it's quite often great for the minister --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
(Laughter)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
-- and it's not great for their country.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
There's a very simple institutional technology

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which can transform that,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and it's called verified auctions.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to third-generation mobile phones

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
by working out what those rights were worth.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
(Laughter)

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to give expertise on how to conduct auctions.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
There are five such decision points;

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
each one needs an international standard.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
If we could do it, we would change the world.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
We would be helping the reformers in these societies,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
who are struggling for change.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
but we can help the people in these societies

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
who are struggling and usually failing,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
because the odds are so stacked against them.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And yet, we've not got these rules.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is zilch -- nothing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Why on Earth are they not there?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I realized that the reason they're not there

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
politicians will get away with gestures.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
That unless we have an informed society,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
things that look good, but don't work.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And so I realized we had to go through the business

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
of building an informed citizenry.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Laughter).

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
However, I have to say, the process of communication

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
does not come naturally to me.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Laughter)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
-- but his arguments are compelling."

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
(Laughter)

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000
(Applause)

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
If you agree with that sentiment,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
you will realize that I need you.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Please, become ambassadors.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Thank you.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:32.000
(Applause)
