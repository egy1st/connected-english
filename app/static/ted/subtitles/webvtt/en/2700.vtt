00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.735
What if our plants

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.456
could sense the toxicity
levels in the soil

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.520
and express that toxicity
through the color of its leaves?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.000
What if those plants could also
remove those toxins from the soil?

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.656
Instead, what if those plants

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.536
grew their own packaging,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.136
or were designed to only be harvested

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.416
by their owners' own patented machines?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.336
What happens when biological design

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.896
is driven by the motivations
of mass-produced commodities?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.520
What kind of world would that be?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.256
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer
and researcher at MIT Media Lab,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.416
where I'm part of a relatively new
and unique group called Design Fiction,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.536
where we're wedged somewhere
between science fiction and science fact.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.696
And at MIT, I am lucky enough
to rub shoulders with scientists

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.696
studying all kinds of cutting edge fields

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.096
like synthetic neurobiology,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.136
artificial intelligence, artificial life

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.896
and everything in between.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.736
And across campus,
there's truly brilliant scientists

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.256
asking questions like,
"How can I make the world a better place?"

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.176
And part of what my group
likes to ask is, "What is better?"

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.296
What is better for you, for me,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.456
for a white woman, a gay man,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.976
a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.056
Technology is never neutral.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.736
It frames a reality

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.536
and reflects a context.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.296
Can you imagine what it would say
about the work-life balance at your office

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.496
if these were standard issue
on the first day?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.936
(Laughter)

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.216
I believe it's the role
of artists and designers

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.376
to raise critical questions.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.816
Art is how you can see
and feel the future,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.296
and today is an exciting
time to be a designer,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.456
for all the new tools becoming accessible.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.056
For instance, synthetic biology

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.976
seeks to write biology
as a design problem.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.536
And through these developments,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.496
my lab asks, what are the roles
and responsibilities

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.856
of an artist, designer,
scientist or businessman?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.416
What are the implications

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.176
of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.816
and how are they shaping our notions
of what it means to be a human?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.136
What are the implications of this
on society, on evolution

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.736
and what are the stakes in this game?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.976
My own speculative design research
at the current moment

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.416
plays with synthetic biology,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.456
but for more emotionally driven output.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.256
I'm obsessed with olfaction
as a design space,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.096
and this project started with this idea

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.896
of what if you could take
a smell selfie, a smelfie?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.376
(Laughter)

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.136
What if you could take
your own natural body odor

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.216
and send it to a lover?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.016
Funny enough, I found that this
was a 19th century Austrian tradition,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.656
where couples in courtship
would keep a slice of apple

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.256
crammed under their armpit during dances,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.816
and at the end of the evening,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.216
the girl would give the guy
she most fancied her used fruit,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.416
and if the feeling was mutual,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.376
he would wolf down that stinky apple.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.520
(Laughter)

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.976
Famously, Napoleon wrote
many love letters to Josephine,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.256
but perhaps amongst the most memorable
is this brief and urgent note:

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.496
"Home in three days. Don't bathe."

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.576
(Laughter)

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760
Both Napoleon and Josephine
adored violets.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.456
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.296
carried violets on their wedding day,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.335
and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.896
every year on their anniversary.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.496
When Josephine passed away,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.096
he planted violets at her grave,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.936
and just before his exile,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.096
he went back to that tomb site,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.776
picked some of those flowers,
entombed them in a locket

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.536
and wore them until the day he died.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.096
And I found this so moving,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.016
I thought, could I engineer that violet
to smell just like Josephine?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.696
What if, for the rest of eternity,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.296
when you went to visit her site,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.576
you could smell Josephine
just as Napoleon loved her?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.016
Could we engineer new ways of mourning,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.136
new rituals for remembering?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.856
After all, we've engineered
transgenic crops

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.016
to be maximized for profit,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.176
crops that stand up to transport,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.136
crops that have a long shelf life,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.616
crops that taste sugary sweet
but resist pests,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.056
sometimes at the expense
of nutritional value.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.656
Can we harness these same technologies
for an emotionally sensitive output?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.976
So currently in my lab,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.296
I'm researching questions like,
what makes a human smell like a human?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.936
And it turns out it's fairly complicated.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.176
Factors such as your diet,
your medications, your lifestyle

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.216
all factor into the way you smell.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.776
And I found that our sweat
is mostly odorless,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.935
but it's our bacteria and microbiome

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.696
that's responsible for your smells,
your mood, your identity

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.336
and so much beyond.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.656
And there's all kinds
of molecules that you emit

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.960
but which we only perceive subconsciously.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.456
So I've been cataloging and collecting

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.656
bacteria from different sites of my body.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.656
After talking to a scientist, we thought,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.376
maybe the perfect concoction of Ani

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.376
is like 10 percent collarbone,
30 percent underarm,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.696
40 percent bikini line and so forth,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.776
and occasionally
I let researchers from other labs

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.456
take a sniff of my samples.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.656
And it's been interesting to hear
how smell of the body

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.496
is perceived outside
of the context of the body.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.096
I've gotten feedback such as,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.576
smells like flowers, like chicken,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.816
like cornflakes,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.296
like beef carnitas.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.216
(Laughter)

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.856
At the same time, I cultivate
a set of carnivorous plants

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.536
for their ability to emit
fleshlike odors to attract prey,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.376
in an attempt to kind of create
this symbiotic relationship

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.320
between my bacteria and this organism.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.176
And as it so happens,
I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.496
and I was talking to a scientist

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.896
who happens to be a chemist
and a plant scientist,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.816
and I was telling him about my project,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.976
and he was like, "Well, this sounds
like botany for lonely women."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.016
(Laughter)

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.936
Unperturbed, I said, "OK."

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.176
I challenged him.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.496
"Can we engineer a plant
that can love me back?"

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.976
And for some reason,
he was like, "Sure, why not?"

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.936
So we started with,
can we get a plant to grow towards me

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.416
like I was the sun?

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.376
And so we're looking at mechanisms
in plants such as phototropism,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.576
which causes the plant
to grow towards the sun

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.576
by producing hormones like auxin,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.256
which causes cell elongation
on the shady side.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.416
And right now I'm creating
a set of lipsticks

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.256
that are infused with these chemicals

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.936
that allow me to interact with a plant
on its own chemical signatures --

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.376
lipsticks that cause plants
to grow where I kiss it,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.136
plants that blossom
where I kiss the bloom.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.936
And through these projects,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.376
I'm asking questions like,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.096
how do we define nature?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.656
How do we define nature
when we can reengineer its properties,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.096
and when should we do it?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.816
Should we do it for profit, for utility?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.536
Can we do it for emotional ends?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.136
Can biotechnology be used
to create work as moving as music?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.056
What are the thresholds between science

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.920
and its ability to shape
our emotional landscape?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.416
It's a famous design mantra
that form follows function.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.496
Well, now, wedged somewhere
between science, design and art

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.736
I get to ask,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.216
what if fiction informs fact?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.296
What kind of R&amp;D lab would that look like

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.936
and what kind of questions
would we ask together?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.296
We often look to technology as the answer,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.856
but as an artist and designer,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.376
I like to ask, but what is the question?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.616
Thank you.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.000
(Applause)
