00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.350
(Guitar)

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:19.061
(Singing)

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.151
Rollercoaster,

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.211
carousel.

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:31.512
Where the highs are heaven,

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:32.621
but the lows,

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.210
oh, they can be hell.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.986
You can grab the ring,

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:42.421
you can ring that bell,

00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:46.770
when the ride is over,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.734
you can never tell.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.858
People tell you this one thing --

00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:58.541
will make your life complete.

00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.971
So you,

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.508
you give it everything you got

00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:06.038
and you wind up on the street.

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:11.709
Then one day you wake up,

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.658
and they tell you "you're a queen,"

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:19.465
but then you find that someone else

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:21.642
is pulling on the strings.

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:25.902
Rollercoaster,

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:28.462
carousel.

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:34.005
Where the highs are heaven,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:35.081
but the lows,

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.720
oh, they can be hell.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.306
You can grab the ring,

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:44.777
you can ring that bell,

00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:49.041
when the ride is over,

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.475
you can never tell.

00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:55.512
The one you love,

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:56.561
they love you --

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.192
oh yeah --

00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:01.224
until the end of time.

00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:04.701
But lose your edge or lose your cool,

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:08.533
they will drop you like a dime.

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:13.680
Everyone is crowding 'round

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.540
when fortune is your friend.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.395
When your luck is running out,

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.620
you're all alone again.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.795
Rollercoaster,

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:31.174
carousel.

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:35.903
Where the highs are heaven

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:37.083
but the lows,

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:39.419
oh, they can be hell.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.133
You can grab the ring,

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.529
you can ring that bell,

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.763
when the ride is over

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:53.542
you can never tell.

00:02:56.164 --> 00:03:00.048
Well, maybe I'm just cynical,

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:04.038
and all these words are lies,

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.829
but experience keeps telling me

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.851
that the cautious one is wise.

00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:15.704
But caution makes you hesitate,

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:19.602
and hesitate you're lost,

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:23.509
so take your opportunities

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.689
and never count the cost.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.739
Rollercoaster,

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.197
carousel.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.851
Where the highs are heaven,

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.221
but the lows,

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.489
oh, they can be hell.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.951
You can grab the ring,

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.437
you can ring that bell,

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.971
when the ride is over --

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:52.744
over, over,

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:56.561
you can never, ever tell.

00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.404
Rollercoaster,

00:04:00.404 --> 00:04:04.279
carousel,

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.094
rollercoaster,

00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:08.197
yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:11.708
carousel.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:15.911
Carousel,

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.961
carousel,

00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.797
carousel,

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:32.632
carousel.

00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:36.075

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.811
Michael Pemberton.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.262

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:43.685
Thank you so much.

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:44.760
Thank you.
