00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:05.293
Eight years ago, I was haunted
by an evil spirit.

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:10.486
I was 25 at the time,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.948
and I was living in a tiny house
behind someone else's house

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:16.267
in Los Angeles.

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.943
It was this guest house,
it had kind of been dilapidated,

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.646
not taken care of for a long time.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.121
And one night, I was sitting there

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:30.647
and I got this really spooky feeling,

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.689
kind of the feeling
like you're being watched.

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:36.732
But no one was there except my two dogs,

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:38.634
and they were just chewing their feet.

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:43.141
And I looked around. No one was there.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:47.386
And I thought, OK,
it's just my imagination.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.021
But the feeling just kept getting worse,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:55.337
and I started to feel
this pressure in my chest,

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.453
sort of like the feeling
when you get bad news.

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:01.788
But it started to sink lower and lower

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.205
and almost hurt.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.784
And over the course of that week,
this feeling got worse and worse,

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:13.304
and I started to become convinced
that something was there

00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:16.492
in my little guest house, haunting me.

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:21.138
And I started to hear these sounds,

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:27.100
this "whoosh," kind of whisper,
like something passing through me.

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:32.761
I called my best friend, Claire, and said,

00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:36.737
"I know this is going to sound crazy,

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.825
but, um ...

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.828
I think there's a ghost in my house,
and I need to get rid of it."

00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:48.200
And she said -- she's very
open-minded -- and she said,

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:49.729
"I don't think you're crazy.

00:01:49.753 --> 00:01:53.627
I think you just need
to do a cleansing ritual."

00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.432
(Laughter)

00:01:55.456 --> 00:02:00.881
"So get some sage and burn it,

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:03.403
and tell it to go away."

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:07.089
So I said, "OK,"
and I went and I bought sage.

00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:11.174
I had never done this before,
so I set the sage on fire,

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:17.898
waved it about, and said, "Go away!
This is my house! I live here.

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:19.556
You don't live here!"

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:23.874
But the feeling stayed.
Nothing got better.

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.094
And then I started to think,

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.890
OK, well now this thing is probably
just laughing at me,

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:31.342
because it hasn't left,

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:34.591
and I probably just look like
this impotent, powerless thing

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.850
that couldn't get it to go away.

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:40.799
So every day I'd come home

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:46.339
and you guys, this feeling got so bad
that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:50.440
but I would sit there in bed
and cry every night.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.339
And the feeling on my chest
got worse and worse.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:59.355
It was physically painful.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.801
And I even went to a psychiatrist

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:06.253
and tried to get her
to prescribe me medicine,

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:10.379
and she wouldn't just because
I don't have schizophrenia, OK.

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:12.180
(Laughter)

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:20.737
So finally I got on the internet,
and I Googled "hauntings."

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.847
And I came upon this forum
of ghost hunters.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.203
But these were a special
kind of ghost hunters --

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.771
they were skeptics.

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:33.365
They believed that every case of ghosts
that they had investigated so far

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.564
had been explained away by science.

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:39.532
And I was like, "OK, smart guys,
this is what's happening to me,

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:43.631
and if you have an explanation for me,
I would love to hear it."

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:46.865
And one of them said, "OK.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.975
Um, have you heard
of carbon monoxide poisoning?"

00:03:52.877 --> 00:03:57.339
And I said, "Yeah.

00:03:57.363 --> 00:04:00.710
Like, gas poisoning?"

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.713
Carbon monoxide poisoning
is when you have a gas leak

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:05.180
leaking into your home.

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:11.032
I looked it up, and the symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.186
include a pressure on your chest,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.608
auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.410
and an unexplained feeling of dread.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.233
So that night, I called the gas company.

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:30.062
I said, "I have an emergency.
I need you to come out.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.356
I don't want to get into the story now,
but I need you to come out."

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.573
(Laughter)

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:37.384
They came out. I said,
"I suspect a gas leak."

00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:39.924
They brought their carbon
monoxide detector,

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:41.990
and the man said,

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:45.477
"It's a really good thing
that you called us tonight,

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:47.914
because you could have been
dead very soon."

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:55.034
Thirty-seven percent of Americans
believe in haunted houses,

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:59.648
and I wonder how many of them
have been in one

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:02.664
and how many of them have been in danger.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:09.516
So that haunting story
has led me to my job.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.438
I'm an investigator, and I'm
an investigator in two senses:

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.030
I'm an investigative journalist,

00:05:14.054 --> 00:05:17.240
and I'm also an investigator
of the claims of the paranormal

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:19.260
and claims of the spiritual.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:20.792
And that means a few things.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:24.767
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending
to need an exorcism

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.356
so I can get -- yes, that's right! --
so I can go to an exorcist

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.986
and see if he's using gimmicks
or psychological tricks

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.898
to try to convince someone
that they're possessed.

00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:39.244
Sometimes that means
I'm going undercover in a fringe group

00:05:39.268 --> 00:05:42.641
which I report on
for a podcast that I co-host.

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:47.699
And I've done over 70 investigations
like this with my co-host, Ross.

00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:52.719
I would love to tell you
that nine times out of 10, science wins,

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:55.239
saves the day, it's all explained.

00:05:55.263 --> 00:05:56.432
That's not true.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:06:02.672
The truth is, 10 times out of 10,
science wins, it saves the day.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.464
(Applause)

00:06:15.027 --> 00:06:17.708
And that doesn't mean
there's no such thing as a mystery.

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:21.658
Of course there are mysteries,
but a mystery is a mystery.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.371
It is not a ghost.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:28.087
Now, I believe there are
two kinds of truth,

00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:32.462
and it's taken me a while to get
to this place, but I think this is right,

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:33.750
so hear me out.

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:36.929
I think there is outer truth
and there's inner truth.

00:06:36.953 --> 00:06:40.168
So if you say to me,

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:42.865
"There was a man named Jesus
and he once existed,"

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.586
that's outer truth, right?

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.960
And we can go and look
at the historical record.

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:49.395
We can determine
whether that seems to be true.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.958
And I would argue,
it does seem to be true.

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:57.653
If you say, "Jesus rose
from the dead," -- ooh, trickier.

00:06:57.677 --> 00:06:59.904
(Laughter)

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:07.380
I would say that's an outer-truth claim,

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.442
because he physically rose or he didn't.

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:12.192
I'm not going to get into
whether he rose or he didn't,

00:07:12.216 --> 00:07:14.294
but I would say
that's an outer-truth claim.

00:07:14.318 --> 00:07:16.012
It happened or it didn't happen.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:19.738
But if you say, "I don't care
whether he rose from the dead.

00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:22.106
It's symbolically important to me,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.624
and that metaphor is so meaningful,
so purposeful to me,

00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:27.951
and I'm not going to try
to persuade you of it,"

00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:30.530
now you've moved it
from outer truth to inner truth,

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:32.076
from science to art.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.264
And I think we have a tendency
to not be clear about this,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.700
to try to move our inner truths
to outer truths,

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.627
or to not be fair about it to each other,

00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:44.015
and when people are telling us
their inner truths,

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.650
to try to make them defend them
by outer-truth standards.

00:07:47.674 --> 00:07:51.190
So I'm talking here about outer truth,
about objective things.

00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:56.900
And there was an objective reality
in my haunted house, right?

00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:58.973
Now that I've told you about the gas leak,

00:07:58.997 --> 00:08:01.017
I doubt a single person here
would be like,

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:03.015
"I still think there was a ghost, too" --

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.079
(Laughter)

00:08:04.103 --> 00:08:06.850
because as soon as we have
these scientific explanations,

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:08.536
we know to give up the ghost.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.570
We use these things as stopgaps
for things that we can't explain.

00:08:12.594 --> 00:08:14.595
We don't believe them because of evidence;

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.381
we believe them because
of a lack of evidence.

00:08:18.382 --> 00:08:20.746
So there is a group in Los Angeles

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.478
called the Independent
Investigations Group, or the IIG,

00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:26.482
and they do great work.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.209
They'll give a $10,000 prize

00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:33.760
to anyone who can show,
under scientific conditions,

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:36.139
that they have a paranormal ability.

00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:37.869
No one's done it yet,

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:42.951
but they've had a couple people
who claim that they were clairaudients,

00:08:42.975 --> 00:08:47.031
which means that they can hear voices
either from the great beyond

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:48.953
or they can read minds.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:51.737
And they had one person
who was very sincere,

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.652
who believed that he could read minds.

00:08:54.745 --> 00:09:00.732
So they set up a test with him,
and this is the way it always works.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.002
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol,

00:09:03.026 --> 00:09:05.041
we have a way to scientifically test this.

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:06.218
Do you agree with it?"

00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:08.138
The person says yes. Then they test it.

00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:10.167
It's very important that both sides agree.

00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:12.606
They did that, they tested him.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.184
They said, "OK, you know what?

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:19.050
You weren't able to predict
what Lisa was thinking.

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:21.103
It matched up about the same as chance.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.969
Looks like you don't have the power."

00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:24.843
And that gave them the opportunity

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:30.136
to compassionately sit down with him
and have a very difficult discussion,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.129
which basically amounted to,

00:09:32.153 --> 00:09:36.716
"Hey, we know you're sincere,
and what that means is,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.019
you do hear something in your head."

00:09:39.097 --> 00:09:43.705
And that guy got to make
the very difficult decision,

00:09:43.763 --> 00:09:49.841
but really the life-changing decision
about whether to go get help.

00:09:49.908 --> 00:09:54.951
We're actually helping people
to make these connections

00:09:54.975 --> 00:10:00.285
that maybe before seemed like
otherworldly explanations,

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:05.369
help draw us into reality
and maybe change our lives for the better.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:12.265
Now, on the other hand,
maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.

00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:14.911
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,

00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:17.108
and holy shit, it will be the best thing!

00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:19.856
And every time I do
one of these investigations,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.686
I still get so excited,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.773
and I'm like 75 into them,

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:27.874
and still I swear on number 76,
I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"

00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:29.103
(Laughter)

00:10:29.127 --> 00:10:33.983
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
but I hope I never lose this hope,

00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:37.782
and I invite you to take
this same attitude

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.249
when people share
their outer beliefs with you.

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.740
When talking about testable claims,

00:10:42.764 --> 00:10:46.443
respect them enough to ask
these good questions.

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:49.329
Challenge and see
how you can examine them together,

00:10:49.353 --> 00:10:53.522
because there's this idea
that you can't respect a belief

00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:56.096
and still challenge it,
but that's not true.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.867
When we jiggle the lock,
when we test the claim,

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:02.863
we're saying, OK, I respect you,
I'm listening to what you're saying,

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:04.879
I'm going to test it out with you.

00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:08.258
We've all had that experience
where you're telling someone something,

00:11:08.282 --> 00:11:11.013
and they're like, "Oh,
that's really interesting, yeah,"

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.160
you know you're being had.

00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:16.474
But when someone says, "Really? Huh.

00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.983
Sounds a little sketchy to me,
but I'm listening,"

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:22.664
you at least know
you're being engaged and respected.

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:25.804
And that's the kind of attitude
we should have with these claims.

00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:28.535
That's showing someone
that you care what they're saying.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:31.495
That's respect.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.909
Now, yes, most of these searches
will come up empty,

00:11:38.933 --> 00:11:40.766
but that's how all of science works.

00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:45.264
Every cure for cancer so far
has not panned out,

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.620
but we don't stop looking,

00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:49.174
for two reasons.

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.676
Because number one, the answer matters.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.722
Whether it's looking at the afterlife
or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,

00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:58.079
it all amounts to the same question:

00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:00.782
How long will we be here?

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:05.749
And two, because looking for the truth,

00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:07.082
being open-minded,

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:11.475
and being willing to be wrong
and to change your whole worldview

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:13.547
is awe-inspiring.

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:18.131
I still get excited at ghost stories
every single time.

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:21.239
I still consider that every group
I join might be right,

00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:23.260
and I hope I never lose that hope.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.088
Let's all never lose that hope,

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.967
because searching for what's out there

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:29.905
helps us understand what's in here.

00:12:30.637 --> 00:12:37.098
And also, please have
a carbon monoxide detector in your home.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:39.441
Thank you.

00:12:39.465 --> 00:12:44.429
(Applause)
