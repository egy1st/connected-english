00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.616
I was a blue-eyed,
chubby-cheeked five-year-old

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.760
when I joined my family
on the picket line for the first time.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.960
My mom made me leave
my dolls in the minivan.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.896
I'd stand on a street corner
in the heavy Kansas humidity,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.536
surrounded by a few dozen relatives,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680
with my tiny fists clutching
a sign that I couldn't read yet:

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.280
"Gays are worthy of death."

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.320
This was the beginning.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.256
Our protests soon became
a daily occurrence

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.216
and an international phenomenon,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.696
and as a member
of Westboro Baptist Church,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.856
I became a fixture
on picket lines across the country.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.216
The end of my antigay picketing career

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.656
and life as I knew it,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.336
came 20 years later,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.856
triggered in part by strangers on Twitter

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.560
who showed me the power
of engaging the other.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.496
In my home,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.640
life was framed as an epic
spiritual battle between good and evil.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.776
The good was my church and its members,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.720
and the evil was everyone else.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.336
My church's antics were such

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.776
that we were constantly
at odds with the world,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.599
and that reinforced
our otherness on a daily basis.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.256
"Make a difference
between the unclean and the clean,"

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.616
the verse says,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.976
and so we did.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.136
From baseball games to military funerals,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.936
we trekked across the country
with neon protest signs in hand

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.936
to tell others exactly
how "unclean" they were

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.680
and exactly why
they were headed for damnation.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.800
This was the focus of our whole lives.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.520
This was the only way for me to do good
in a world that sits in Satan's lap.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.336
And like the rest of my 10 siblings,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.816
I believed what I was taught
with all my heart,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.680
and I pursued Westboro's agenda
with a special sort of zeal.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.920
In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.976
Initially, the people
I encountered on the platform

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.216
were just as hostile as I expected.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.736
They were the digital version
of the screaming hordes

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.416
I'd been seeing at protests
since I was a kid.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.896
But in the midst of that digital brawl,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.256
a strange pattern developed.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.936
Someone would arrive at my profile
with the usual rage and scorn,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.096
I would respond with a custom mix
of Bible verses, pop culture references

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.320
and smiley faces.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.616
They would be understandably
confused and caught off guard,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520
but then a conversation would ensue.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.376
And it was civil --

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.720
full of genuine curiosity on both sides.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.120
How had the other come to such
outrageous conclusions about the world?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600
Sometimes the conversation
even bled into real life.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.816
People I'd sparred with on Twitter

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.176
would come out
to the picket line to see me

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.680
when I protested in their city.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880
A man named David was one such person.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.960
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious,"

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.896
and after several months
of heated but friendly arguments online,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.320
he came out to see me
at a picket in New Orleans.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.576
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert
from Jerusalem, where he lives,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.856
and I brought him kosher chocolate

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.936
and held a "God hates Jews" sign.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.016
(Laughter)

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.096
There was no confusion
about our positions,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.280
but the line between friend and foe
was becoming blurred.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.056
We'd started to see each other
as human beings,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.280
and it changed the way
we spoke to one another.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.496
It took time,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.560
but eventually these conversations
planted seeds of doubt in me.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.736
My friends on Twitter took the time
to understand Westboro's doctrines,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.976
and in doing so,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.200
they were able to find inconsistencies
I'd missed my entire life.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.016
Why did we advocate
the death penalty for gays

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.600
when Jesus said, "Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone?"

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.736
How could we claim to love our neighbor

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.360
while at the same time
praying for God to destroy them?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.696
The truth is that the care shown to me
by these strangers on the internet

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.440
was itself a contradiction.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.456
It was growing evidence

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.960
that people on the other side were not
the demons I'd been led to believe.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200
These realizations were life-altering.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.496
Once I saw that we were not
the ultimate arbiters of divine truth

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.296
but flawed human beings,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.880
I couldn't pretend otherwise.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.896
I couldn't justify our actions --

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.896
especially our cruel practice
of protesting funerals

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.600
and celebrating human tragedy.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.976
These shifts in my perspective

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.096
contributed to a larger erosion
of trust in my church,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.080
and eventually it made it
impossible for me to stay.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.959
In spite of overwhelming grief and terror,
I left Westboro in 2012.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.656
In those days just after I left,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.680
the instinct to hide
was almost paralyzing.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.576
I wanted to hide
from the judgement of my family,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.816
who I knew would never
speak to me again --

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.760
people whose thoughts and opinions
had meant everything to me.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.656
And I wanted to hide from the world
I'd rejected for so long --

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.416
people who had no reason at all
to give me a second chance

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.400
after a lifetime of antagonism.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.176
And yet, unbelievably,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.656
they did.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.056
The world had access to my past
because it was all over the internet --

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.456
thousands of tweets
and hundreds of interviews,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.976
everything from local TV news
to "The Howard Stern Show" --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600
but so many embraced me
with open arms anyway.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.896
I wrote an apology
for the harm I'd caused,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.360
but I also knew that an apology
could never undo any of it.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.216
All I could do was try to build a new life

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.640
and find a way somehow
to repair some of the damage.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.936
People had every reason
to doubt my sincerity,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.200
but most of them didn't.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.080
And --

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.896
given my history,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.856
it was more than I could've hoped for --

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.336
forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.600
It still amazes me.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.080
I spent my first year away from home

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.176
adrift with my younger sister,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.760
who had chosen to leave with me.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.336
We walked into an abyss,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.056
but we were shocked to find
the light and a way forward

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.680
in the same communities
we'd targeted for so long.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.816
David,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.736
my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.496
invited us to spend time among
a Jewish community in Los Angeles.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.736
We slept on couches in the home
of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.960
and their four kids --

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.416
the same rabbi that I'd protested
three years earlier

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.640
with a sign that said,
"Your rabbi is a whore."

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.856
We spent long hours talking
about theology and Judaism and life

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.096
while we washed dishes
in their kosher kitchen

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.840
and chopped vegetables for dinner.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.160
They treated us like family.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.736
They held nothing against us,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.600
and again I was astonished.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.456
That period was full of turmoil,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.776
but one part I've returned to often

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.680
is a surprising realization
I had during that time --

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.776
that it was a relief and a privilege
to let go of the harsh judgments

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.720
that instinctively ran through my mind
about nearly every person I saw.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.400
I realized that now I needed to learn.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.280
I needed to listen.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.656
This has been at the front
of my mind lately,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.616
because I can't help but see
in our public discourse

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.640
so many of the same destructive impulses
that ruled my former church.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.496
We celebrate tolerance and diversity
more than at any other time in memory,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760
and still we grow more and more divided.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.336
We want good things --

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.976
justice, equality,
freedom, dignity, prosperity --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.296
but the path we've chosen

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.440
looks so much like the one
I walked away from four years ago.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.496
We've broken the world into us and them,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.576
only emerging from our bunkers long enough

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.840
to lob rhetorical grenades
at the other camp.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.536
We write off half the country
as out-of-touch liberal elites

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.720
or racist misogynist bullies.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.600
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.296
Even when someone does call for empathy
and understanding for the other side,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.216
the conversation nearly always devolves

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.480
into a debate about
who deserves more empathy.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.216
And just as I learned to do,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.776
we routinely refuse to acknowledge
the flaws in our positions

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.440
or the merits in our opponent's.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.000
Compromise is anathema.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.720
We even target people on our own side
when they dare to question the party line.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.296
This path has brought us cruel,
sniping, deepening polarization,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.920
and even outbreaks of violence.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.616
I remember this path.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.800
It will not take us where we want to go.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.800
What gives me hope is that
we can do something about this.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.200
The good news is that it's simple,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.600
and the bad news is that it's hard.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.160
We have to talk and listen
to people we disagree with.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.936
It's hard because we often can't fathom

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.000
how the other side
came to their positions.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.376
It's hard because righteous indignation,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.576
that sense of certainty
that ours is the right side,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.159
is so seductive.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.256
It's hard because it means
extending empathy and compassion

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.799
to people who show us
hostility and contempt.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.559
The impulse to respond in kind
is so tempting,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.296
but that isn't who we want to be.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.976
We can resist.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.456
And I will always be inspired to do so
by those people I encountered on Twitter,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.176
apparent enemies
who became my beloved friends.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.616
And in the case of one particularly
understanding and generous guy,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.840
my husband.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.640
There was nothing special
about the way I responded to him.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.200
What was special was their approach.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.656
I thought about it a lot
over the past few years

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.536
and I found four things
they did differently

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.640
that made real conversation possible.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.336
These four steps were small but powerful,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.120
and I do everything I can to employ them
in difficult conversations today.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.440
The first is don't assume bad intent.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.696
My friends on Twitter realized

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.656
that even when my words
were aggressive and offensive,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.576
I sincerely believed
I was doing the right thing.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.576
Assuming ill motives
almost instantly cuts us off

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.896
from truly understanding
why someone does and believes as they do.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.656
We forget that they're a human being

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.656
with a lifetime of experience
that shaped their mind,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.376
and we get stuck
on that first wave of anger,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.000
and the conversation has a very hard time
ever moving beyond it.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.456
But when we assume good or neutral intent,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.480
we give our minds a much stronger
framework for dialogue.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.000
The second is ask questions.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.336
When we engage people
across ideological divides,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.816
asking questions
helps us map the disconnect

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.640
between our differing points of view.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.096
That's important because
we can't present effective arguments

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.480
if we don't understand where
the other side is actually coming from

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.440
and because it gives them an opportunity
to point out flaws in our positions.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.536
But asking questions
serves another purpose;

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.040
it signals to someone
that they're being heard.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.896
When my friends on Twitter
stopped accusing

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.696
and started asking questions,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.960
I almost automatically mirrored them.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.616
Their questions gave me room to speak,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.016
but they also gave me permission
to ask them questions

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200
and to truly hear their responses.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.680
It fundamentally changed
the dynamic of our conversation.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.120
The third is stay calm.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.816
This takes practice and patience,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.160
but it's powerful.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.016
At Westboro, I learned not to care
how my manner of speaking affected others.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.096
I thought my rightness
justified my rudeness --

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.856
harsh tones, raised voices,
insults, interruptions --

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.320
but that strategy
is ultimately counterproductive.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.736
Dialing up the volume and the snark
is natural in stressful situations,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.760
but it tends to bring the conversation
to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.856
When my husband was still
just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.736
our discussions frequently
became hard and pointed,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.720
but we always refused to escalate.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.296
Instead, he would change the subject.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.536
He would tell a joke or recommend a book

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.760
or gently excuse himself
from the conversation.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.416
We knew the discussion wasn't over,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.760
just paused for a time
to bring us back to an even keel.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.776
People often lament that digital
communication makes us less civil,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.040
but this is one advantage that online
conversations have over in-person ones.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.296
We have a buffer of time and space

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.640
between us and the people
whose ideas we find so frustrating.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.336
We can use that buffer.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.056
Instead of lashing out,
we can pause, breathe,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.256
change the subject or walk away,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.720
and then come back to it when we're ready.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.400
And finally ...

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.960
make the argument.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.416
This might seem obvious,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.016
but one side effect
of having strong beliefs

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.656
is that we sometimes assume

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.776
that the value of our position
is or should be obvious and self-evident,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.016
that we shouldn't
have to defend our positions

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.136
because they're so clearly right and good

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.736
that if someone doesn't get it,
it's their problem --

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.680
that it's not my job to educate them.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.896
But if it were that simple,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.720
we would all see things the same way.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.816
As kind as my friends on Twitter were,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.216
if they hadn't actually
made their arguments,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.800
it would've been so much harder for me
to see the world in a different way.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.376
We are all a product of our upbringing,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.920
and our beliefs reflect our experiences.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.080
We can't expect others
to spontaneously change their own minds.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.976
If we want change,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.720
we have to make the case for it.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.216
My friends on Twitter didn't abandon
their beliefs or their principles --

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.440
only their scorn.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.856
They channeled their
infinitely justifiable offense

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.000
and came to me with pointed questions
tempered with kindness and humor.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.976
They approached me as a human being,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.576
and that was more transformative

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.840
than two full decades
of outrage, disdain and violence.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.536
I know that some might not have
the time or the energy or the patience

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.816
for extensive engagement,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.896
but as difficult as it can be,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.416
reaching out to someone we disagree with

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.720
is an option that is
available to all of us.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.096
And I sincerely believe
that we can do hard things,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.760
not just for them
but for us and our future.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.976
Escalating disgust
and intractable conflict

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.136
are not what we want for ourselves,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.416
or our country

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.640
or our next generation.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.816
My mom said something to me
a few weeks before I left Westboro,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.256
when I was desperately hoping

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.360
there was a way
I could stay with my family.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.296
People I have loved
with every pulse of my heart

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.656
since even before I was
that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.360
standing on a picket line
holding a sign I couldn't read.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.816
She said, "You're just a human being,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.520
my dear, sweet child."

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.016
She was asking me to be humble --

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.160
not to question
but to trust God and my elders.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.496
But to me, she was missing
the bigger picture --

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.480
that we're all just human beings.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.056
That we should be guided
by that most basic fact,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.296
and approach one another
with generosity and compassion.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.616
Each one of us
contributes to the communities

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.200
and the cultures and the societies
that we make up.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.656
The end of this spiral of rage and blame
begins with one person

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.440
who refuses to indulge
these destructive, seductive impulses.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.936
We just have to decide
that it's going to start with us.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.176
Thank you.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.510
(Applause)
