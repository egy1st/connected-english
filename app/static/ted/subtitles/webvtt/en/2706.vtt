WEBVTT

00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.579
Why do we think

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:07.894
that stories by men are deemed
to be of universal importance,

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:12.773
and stories by women are thought
to be merely about women?

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.552
My grandmother left school
when she was 12.

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:19.247
She had 14 children.

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:22.247
My mother left school when she was 15.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.672
She was a secretary.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:27.454
I graduated from university
to become a theater director,

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:31.637
and that progress is entirely to do
with the fact that people I'll never meet

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:33.909
fought for women to have rights,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.074
get the vote, get education,
have progress.

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:40.683
And I'm determined to do the same,
and obviously you are, too.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.884
Why not?

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.465
(Applause)

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.201
So I started a festival called WOW,
Women of the World, seven years ago,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.229
and it's now in 20 countries
across five continents.

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:53.604
And one of those countries
is Somaliland in Africa.

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:55.843
So I traveled there last year,

00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:01.460
and part of the joy I had in going there
was going to these caves.

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:04.898
The Laas Geel caves.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:10.436
Now, these caves contain some
of the oldest cave paintings in the world.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:16.274
These paintings are thought to be
round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.539
Art:

00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:22.326
what humanity has done
ever since it evolved.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.473
It's how we speak about ourselves,

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:26.434
how we understand our identity,

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.206
how we look at our surroundings,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.301
who we find out about each other

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.535
because of the meaning of our lives.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.883
That's what art is for.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.933
So look at this little picture.

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:39.903
I think it's a little girl.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:42.703
I thought it was a bit like me
when I was a little girl.

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.362
And I thought, well, who painted
this joyful, youthful figure?

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:49.490
And I asked the curator of the caves.

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:53.032
I said, "Tell me about the men
and women who painted these."

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:56.533
And he looked at me
absolutely askance, and he said,

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.769
"Women didn't paint these pictures."

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:01.745
And I said, "Well,
it was 11,000 years ago."

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.228
I said, "How do you know?"

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:05.779
(Laughter)

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:09.534
And he said, "Women don't do these things.

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:13.197
Men made these marks. Women don't."

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:18.317
Now, I wasn't really surprised,

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:22.399
because that's an attitude
that I've seen continuously

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:25.195
all my life as a theater maker.

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:32.362
We are told that divine knowledge
comes down through the masculine,

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.973
whether it be to the imam,
the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:42.717
Similarly, we're told that creative genius
resides in the masculine,

00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.487
that it is the masculine

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.576
that will be able to tell us
about who we really are,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.667
that the masculine will tell
the universal story

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.578
on behalf of all of us,

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:57.177
whereas women artists will really
just talk about women's experiences,

00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.577
women's issues
only really relevant to women

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.579
and of passing interest to men --

00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:05.505
and really only some men.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.180
And it's that conviction,

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:09.585
that that we are taught,

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.409
that I think colors so much
of whether we're prepared to believe

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:15.934
that women's stories really matter.

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.505
And unless we're prepared to believe
that women's stories really matter,

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.519
then women's rights don't really matter,

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:25.215
and then change can't really come.

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:31.586
I want to tell you
about two examples of stories

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.548
that are thought to be
of universal importance:

00:03:34.572 --> 00:03:37.328
"E.T." and "Hamlet."

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.463
(Laughter)

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.753
So I took my two children
when they were little --

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:47.027
Caroline was eight and Robby was five --

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.618
to see "E.T."

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:52.027
And it's a fantastic story
of this little alien

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.002
who ends up in an American family

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:57.235
with a mum, two brothers and a sister,

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.902
but he wants to go home.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.340
Not only that, but some
really bad scientists

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:04.738
want to do some experiments on him,

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:06.448
and they're looking for him.

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.049
So the children have a plot.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.910
They decide they're going to take him
back to his spaceship

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:13.085
as soon as they can,

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.983
and they plop him in a bicycle basket,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.349
and off they ride.

00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:20.269
But unfortunately, the baddies
have found out, and they're catching up

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.650
and they've got sirens
and they've got their guns,

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.348
they've got the loud-hailers,
it's terribly frightening,

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.292
and they're closing up on the children,

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.412
and the children are never
going to make it.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.529
And then all of a sudden, magically,
the bikes fly up in the air,

00:04:33.553 --> 00:04:35.092
over the clouds,

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:36.304
over the moon,

00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:38.619
and they're going to save "E.T."

00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:41.672
So I turn to see my children's faces,

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:46.166
and Robby is enraptured,
he's there with them, he's saving E.T.,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.046
he's a happy boy.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.208
And I turn to Caroline,
and she's crying her eyes out.

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:53.411
And I said, "What's the matter?"

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:58.970
And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.?
Why can't I come?"

00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:01.781
And then all of a sudden I realized:

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:03.216
they weren't children;

00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:05.120
they were boys --

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:07.820
all boys.

00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:10.821
And Caroline, who had invested
so much in E.T.,

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.015
well, she wasn't invited to save him,

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.716
and she felt humiliated and spurned.

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:18.161
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:24.353
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:26.927
and I said, "I don't know
if you understand

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.330
the psychological importance
of what's happened,

00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:31.854
and are you prepared to pay
for the therapy bills?"

00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:33.292
(Laughter)

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:36.288
Twenty years later, I haven't
had a word back from him,

00:05:36.312 --> 00:05:37.750
but I'm still hopeful.

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.384
(Laughter)

00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.012
But I thought it was interesting,

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:43.908
because if you read reviews
of what he intended with E.T.,

00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:45.723
he says very specifically,

00:05:45.747 --> 00:05:48.249
"I wanted the world to understand

00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:51.480
that we should love
and embrace difference."

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:56.126
But somehow he didn't include
the idea of girls' difference

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.842
in this thinking.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:02.176
He thought he was writing a story
about all humanity.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.278
Caroline thought he was marginalizing

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:05.731
half of humanity.

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:08.839
He thought he was writing a story
about human goodness;

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:13.249
she thought he was writing
a lad's heroic adventure.

00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:15.789
And this is common.

00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:21.633
Men feel they have been given the mantle
for universal communication,

00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:23.609
but of course, how could they be?

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.713
They are writing from male experience
through male's eyes.

00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:32.249
We have to have a look at this ourselves.

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.949
We have to be prepared to go back
through all our books and our films,

00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:37.310
all our favorite things,

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:40.164
and say, "Actually, this is written
by a male artist --

00:06:40.188 --> 00:06:42.176
not an artist.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.604
We have to see
that so many of these stories

00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:46.764
are written through a male perspective.

00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:48.725
Which is fine,

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:52.247
but then females need to have
50 percent of the rights

00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.825
for the stage, the film, the novel,

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.638
the place of creativity.

00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:59.360
Let me talk about "Hamlet."

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:01.077
To be or not to be.

00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:02.315
That is the question.

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:04.263
But it's not my question.

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:08.536
My question is: Why was I taught
as a young woman

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.917
that this was the quintessential
example of human dilemma

00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:14.637
and human experience?

00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:15.997
It's a marvelous story,

00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:21.357
but actually, it's about a young man
fearful that he won't be able to make it

00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.046
as a powerful figure in a male world

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.785
unless he takes revenge
for his father's murder.

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:32.230
He talks a great deal to us
about suicide being an option,

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:36.923
but the reality is that the person
who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:39.445
after she's been humiliated
and abused by him,

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.645
never gets a chance to talk
to the audience about her feelings.

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.611
And then when he's finished with Ophelia,
he turns on his mum,

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:48.934
because basically she has the audacity
to fall in love with his uncle

00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.170
and enjoy sex.

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:52.231
(Laughter)

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:54.343
It is a great story,

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:59.438
but it is a story about male conflict,
male dilemma, male struggle.

00:08:00.137 --> 00:08:04.329
But I was told this was the story
of human beings,

00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:07.396
despite the fact that it only
had two women in it.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.981
And unless I reeducate myself,

00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:11.730
I am always going to think

00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:15.495
that women's stories
matter less than men's.

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:17.901
A woman could have written "Hamlet,"

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.012
but she would have written it differently,

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:22.644
and it wouldn't have had
global recognition.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.739
As the writer Margaret Atwood says,

00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:27.249
"When a man writes about doing the dishes,

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.568
it's realism.

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:31.500
When a woman writes about doing it,

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:34.039
it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:35.272
(Laughter)

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:39.130
Now, this is not just something
that belongs to then.

00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:40.954
I mean, when I was a young girl,

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:43.602
wanting desperately
to be a theater director,

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:46.465
this is what my male lecturer said to me:

00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:50.561
"Well, there are three women
directors in Britain," he said, "Jude."

00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:54.692
"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,
there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,

00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:57.496
and there's Buzz Goodbody,
who's just killed herself.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.776
So, which of those three
would you like to be?"

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.853
(Laughter)

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:05.463
Now, leaving aside
the disgusting slur on gay women,

00:09:05.487 --> 00:09:08.332
the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.

00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:12.115
He thought it was silly
that I wanted to be a director.

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:15.110
And I told my friend Marin Alsop,
the conductor, and she said,

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.883
"Oh yes, well, my music teacher
said exactly the same.

00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:20.077
He said, 'Women don't conduct.'"

00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:23.427
But all these years later,
we've made our mark.

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:25.681
You think, "Well, it'll be different now."

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:28.199
I'm afraid it's not different now.

00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:31.668
The current head
of the Paris Conservatoire

00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:35.119
said recently, "It takes
great physical strength

00:09:35.143 --> 00:09:36.624
to conduct a symphony,

00:09:36.648 --> 00:09:38.099
and women are too weak."

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:39.576
(Laughter)

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.539
The artist George Baselitz said,

00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:43.850
"Well, the fact is women can't paint.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.720
Well -- they can't paint very well."

00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:48.582
The writer V.S. Naipaul
said two years ago,

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:52.198
"I can read two paragraphs and know
immediately if it's written by a woman,

00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.923
and I just stop reading,
because it's not worthy of me."

00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:56.620
Audience: Whoa!

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.022
And it goes on.

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:02.985
We have to find a way

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:05.653
of stopping young girls and women

00:10:05.677 --> 00:10:08.518
feeling not only that
their story doesn't matter,

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:11.752
but they're not allowed
to be the storyteller.

00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:16.244
Because once you feel
that you can't stand in the central space

00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:19.276
and speak on behalf of the world,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.375
you will feel that you can offer
your goods up to a small, select group.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.915
You will tend to do smaller work
on smaller stages,

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.972
your economic power will be less,

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.468
your reach of audiences will be less,

00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:36.833
and your credit will be less as an artist.

00:10:37.557 --> 00:10:42.812
And we do finally give artists
these incredible, prominent spaces

00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.000
in the world,

00:10:44.024 --> 00:10:45.763
because they are our storytellers.

00:10:45.787 --> 00:10:48.916
Now, why should it matter to you
if you're not an artist?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.185
Supposing you're an accountant
or an entrepreneur or a medic

00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:53.376
or a scientist:

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.002
Should you care about women artists?

00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:58.082
Absolutely, you must,

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:01.518
because as you can see
from the cave paintings,

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:03.223
all civilizations,

00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:05.451
all of humanity

00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:10.061
have relied upon artists
to tell the human story,

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:13.354
and if the human story
is finally told by men,

00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:15.114
take my word for it,

00:11:15.138 --> 00:11:16.855
it will be about men.

00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:20.355
So let's make a change.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.581
Let's make a change
to all our institutions,

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:23.880
and not just in the West.

00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:28.323
Don't forget -- this message
of incapability of women

00:11:28.347 --> 00:11:30.372
to hold creative genius

00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:35.310
is being told to girls and women
in Nigeria, in China, in Russia,

00:11:35.334 --> 00:11:36.497
in Indonesia.

00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:39.230
All over the world, girls
and women are being told

00:11:39.254 --> 00:11:44.171
that they can't finally hold the idea
of creative inspiration.

00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:46.780
And I want to ask you:

00:11:46.804 --> 00:11:48.518
Do you believe that?

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:52.337
Do you believe that women
can be a creative genius?

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:58.907
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:00.592
Well then, please go forward,

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.866
support women artists,

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.364
buy their work,

00:12:04.388 --> 00:12:06.656
insist that their voices are heard,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.950
find platforms on which
their voices will be made.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.467
And remember this:

00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:15.770
that in a sense, if we're going
to get past this moment

00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:19.646
of a world where we know
that we are unequal,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.867
it's artists who have to imagine
a different world.

00:12:22.891 --> 00:12:26.501
And I'm calling on all artists,
women and men,

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:29.865
to imagine a gender-equal world.

00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.509
Let's paint it. Let's draw it.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.328
Let's write about it. Let's film it.

00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:36.238
And if we could imagine it,

00:12:36.262 --> 00:12:39.742
then we would have the energy
and the stamina

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:41.255
to work towards it.

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.856
When I see this little girl,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.920
11,000 years ago,

00:12:45.944 --> 00:12:49.405
I want to know that the little girl now

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:52.713
can stand there and think
she's entitled to her dreams,

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:55.027
she's entitled to her destiny

00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:59.253
and she's entitled to speak
on behalf of the whole world,

00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.101
be recognized for it

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:02.775
and applauded.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.985
Thank you.

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:08.790
(Applause)
