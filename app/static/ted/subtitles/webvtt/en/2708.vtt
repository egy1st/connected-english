00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.376
For several years now,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.520
we've been engaged in a national debate
about sexual assault on campus.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.376
No question --

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.600
it's crucial that young people
understand the ground rules for consent,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360
but that's where the conversation
about sex is ending.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.096
And in that vacuum of information

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.096
the media and the Internet --

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.856
that new digital street corner --

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.160
are educating our kids for us.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.336
If we truly want young people
to engage safely, ethically,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.056
and yes, enjoyably,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.840
it's time to have open honest discussion
about what happens after "yes,"

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.856
and that includes breaking
the biggest taboo of all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.616
and talking to young people

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.040
about women's capacity for
and entitlement to sexual pleasure.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.656
Yeah.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.696
(Applause)

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.936
Come on, ladies.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.856
(Applause)

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.696
I spent three years
talking to girls ages 15 to 20

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.656
about their attitudes
and experience of sex.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.096
And what I found was

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.416
that while young women may feel
entitled to engage in sexual behavior,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.520
they don't necessarily
feel entitled to enjoy it.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.376
Take this sophomore
at the Ivy League college

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.616
who told me,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.896
"I come from a long line
of smart, strong women.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.136
My grandmother was a firecracker,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.016
my mom is a professional,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.400
my sister and I are loud,
and that's our form of feminine power."

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.056
She then proceeded
to describe her sex life to me:

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.136
a series of one-off hookups,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.896
starting when she was 13,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.376
that were ...

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.496
not especially responsible,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.656
not especially reciprocal

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.160
and not especially enjoyable.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.696
She shrugged.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.336
"I guess we girls are just socialized
to be these docile creatures

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600
who don't express our wants or needs."

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.136
"Wait a minute," I replied.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.240
"Didn't you just tell me
what a smart, strong woman you are?"

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400
She hemmed and hawed.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.896
"I guess," she finally said,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.440
"no one told me that that smart,
strong image applies to sex."

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.895
I should probably say right up top
that despite the hype,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.816
teenagers are not engaging in intercourse
more often or at a younger age

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.056
than they were 25 years ago.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.736
They are, however,
engaging in other behavior.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.336
And when we ignore that,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.840
when we label that as "not sex,"

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.040
that opens the door
to risky behavior and disrespect.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.576
That's particularly true of oral sex,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.496
which teenagers consider
to be less intimate than intercourse.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.416
Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal,"

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.496
like they'd all read
the same instruction manual --

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.520
at least if boys
were on the receiving end.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.456
Young women have lots
of reasons for participating.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.176
It made them feel desired;

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.776
it was a way to boost social status.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.880
Sometimes, it was a way
to get out of an uncomfortable situation.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.616
As a freshman at a West Coast
college said to me,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.376
"A girl will give a guy a blow job
at the end of the night

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.576
because she doesn't
want to have sex with him,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.696
and he expects to be satisfied.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.576
So, if I want him to leave

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.553
and I don't want anything to happen ... "

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.856
I heard so many stories
of girls performing one-sided oral sex

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.896
that I started asking,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.176
"What if every time
you were alone with a guy,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.176
he told you to get him
a glass of water from the kitchen,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.536
and he never got you a glass of water --

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.040
or if he did, it was like ...

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.080
'you want me to uh ...?'"

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.320
You know, totally begrudging.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.960
You wouldn't stand for it.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.576
But it wasn't always
that boys didn't want to.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.256
It was that girls didn't want them to.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.456
Girls expressed a sense of shame
around their genitals.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.240
A sense that they were
simultaneously icky and sacred.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.136
Women's feelings about their genitals

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280
have been directly linked
to their enjoyment of sex.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.696
Yet, Debby Herbenick,
a researcher at Indiana University,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.296
believes that girls' genital
self-image is under siege,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.976
with more pressure than ever

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.520
to see them as unacceptable
in their natural state.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.776
According to research,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.216
about three-quarters of college women
remove their pubic hair -- all of it --

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.896
at least on occasion,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.200
and more than half do so regularly.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.336
Girls would tell me that hair removal
made them feel cleaner,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.200
that it was a personal choice.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.056
Though, I kind of wondered
if left alone on a desert island,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.096
if this was how they would
choose to spend their time.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.656
(Laughter)

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.096
And when I pushed further,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.256
a darker motivation emerged:

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.000
avoiding humiliation.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.776
"Guys act like they
would be disgusted by it,"

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.240
one young woman told me.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.960
"No one wants to be
talked about like that."

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.656
The rising pubic hair removal
reminded me of the 1920s,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.176
when women first started regularly
shaving their armpits and their legs.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.736
That's when flapper dresses
came into style,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.336
and women's limbs were suddenly visible,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.800
open to public scrutiny.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.616
There's a way that I think
that this too is a sign.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.600
That a girl's most intimate part
is open to public scrutiny,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.136
open to critique,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.656
to becoming more about
how it looks to someone else

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.760
than how it feels to her.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.720
The shaving trend has sparked
another rise in labiaplasty.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.560
Labiaplasty, which is the trimming
of the inner and outer labia,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.520
is the fastest-growing cosmetic
surgery among teenage girls.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.856
It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.896
and whereas girls under 18 comprise
two percent of all cosmetic surgeries,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.920
they are five percent of labiaplasty.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.896
The most sought-after look, incidentally,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.656
in which the outer labia
appear fused like a clam shell,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.136
is called ...

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.360
wait for it ...

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.816
"The Barbie."

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.136
(Groan)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.176
I trust I don't have to tell you

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.096
that Barbie is a) made of plastic

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.296
and b) has no genitalia.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.216
(Laughter)

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.016
The labiaplasty trend
has become so worrisome

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.696
that the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.976
has issued a statement on the procedure,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.496
which is rarely medically indicated,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.656
has not been proven safe

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.536
and whose side effects
include scarring, numbness, pain

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.520
and diminished sexual sensation.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.976
Now, admittedly,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.576
and blessedly,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.360
the number of girls involved
is still quite small,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.256
but you could see them
as canaries in a coal mine,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.280
telling us something important
about the way girls see their bodies.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.456
Sara McClelland,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.936
a psychologist
at the University of Michigan,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.480
coined what is my favorite phrase ever
in talking about all of this:

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.200
"Intimate justice."

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.776
That's the idea that sex has political,
as well as personal implications,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.456
just like, who does
the dishes in your house,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.080
or who vacuums the rug.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.496
And it raises similar
issues about inequality,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.496
about economic disparity,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.736
violence,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.200
physical and mental health.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.576
Intimate justice asks us to consider

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.936
who is entitled
to engage in an experience.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.456
Who is entitled to enjoy it?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.680
Who is the primary beneficiary?

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.520
And how does each partner
define "good enough"?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.416
Honestly, I think those questions
are tricky and sometimes traumatic

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.920
for adult women to confront,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.296
but when we're talking about girls,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.616
I just kept coming back to the idea
that their early sexual experience

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.400
shouldn't have to be
something that they get over.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.776
In her work,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.616
McClelland found that young women
were more likely than young men

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.520
to use their partner's pleasure
as a measure of their satisfaction.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.456
So they'd say things like,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.296
"If he's sexually satisfied,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.880
then I'm sexually satisfied."

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.280
Young men were more likely to measure
their satisfaction by their own orgasm.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.360
Young women also defined
bad sex differently.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.416
In the largest ever survey

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.576
ever conducted
on American sexual behavior,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.376
they reported pain
in their sexual encounters

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.280
30 percent of the time.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.360
They also used words like "depressing,"

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.696
"humiliating,"

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.920
"degrading."

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.520
The young men never used that language.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.816
So when young women
report sexual satisfaction levels

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.760
that are equal to
or greater than young men's --

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.680
and they do in research --

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.840
that can be deceptive.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.256
If a girl goes into an encounter
hoping that it won't hurt,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.296
wanting to feel close to her partner

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.360
and expecting him to have an orgasm,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.520
she'll be satisfied
if those criteria are met.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.376
And there's nothing wrong with wanting
to feel close to your partner,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.736
or wanting him to be happy,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.284
and orgasm isn't the only
measure of an experience ...

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.800
but absence of pain --

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.280
that's a very low bar
for your own sexual fulfillment.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.216
Listening to all of this
and thinking about it,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.536
I began to realize that we performed
a kind of psychological clitoridectomy

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.800
on American girls.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.656
Starting in infancy,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.496
parents of baby boys are more likely
to name all their body parts,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.600
at least they'll say,
"here's your pee-pee."

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.456
Parents of baby girls
go right from navel to knees,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.936
and they leave this whole
situation in here unnamed.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.296
(Laughter)

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.776
There's no better way
to make something unspeakable

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.000
than not to name it.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.696
Then kids go into
their puberty education classes

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.800
and they learn that boys
have erections and ejaculations,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.336
and girls have ...

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.280
periods and unwanted pregnancy.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.896
And they see that internal diagram
of a woman's reproductive system --

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.616
you know, the one that looks
kind of like a steer head --

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.120
(Laughter)

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.040
And it always grays out between the legs.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.936
So we never say vulva,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.336
we certainly never say clitoris.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.576
No surprise,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.736
fewer than half
of teenage girls age 14 to 17

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.760
have ever masturbated.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.176
And then they go
into their partnered experience

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.896
and we expect that somehow
they'll think sex is about them,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.600
that they'll be able to articulate
their needs, their desires, their limits.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.920
It's unrealistic.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.640
Here's something, though.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.496
Girls' investment
in their partner's pleasure remains

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.960
regardless of the gender of the partner.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.936
So in same-sex encounters,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.440
the orgasm gap disappears.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.960
And young women climax
at the same rate as men.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.296
Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.896
that they felt liberated
to get off the script --

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.336
free to create an encounter
that worked for them.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.016
Gay girls also challenged
the idea of first intercourse

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.976
as the definition of virginity.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.576
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.976
but it's worth questioning
why we consider this one act,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.816
which most girls associate
with discomfort or pain,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.336
to be the line in the sand
of sexual adulthood --

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.816
so much more meaningful,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.600
so much more transformative
than anything else.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.096
And it's worth considering
how this is serving girls;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.136
whether it's keeping them
safer from disease,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.040
coercion, betrayal, assault.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.640
Whether it's encouraging
mutuality and caring;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.976
what it means about the way
they see other sex acts;

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.216
whether it's giving them more control over

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.080
and joy in their experience,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.616
and what it means about gay teens,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.680
who can have multiple sex partners
without heterosexual intercourse.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.800
So I asked a gay girl that I met,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.680
"How'd you know
you weren't a virgin anymore?"

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.016
She said she had to Google it.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.216
(Laughter)

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.800
And Google wasn't sure.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.016
(Laughter)

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.976
She finally decided
that she wasn't a virgin anymore

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.720
after she'd had
her first orgasm with a partner.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.536
And I thought --

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.760
whoa.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.776
What if just for a second

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.160
we imagined that was the definition?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.896
Again, not because
intercourse isn't a big deal --

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.216
of course it is --

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.560
but it isn't the only big deal,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.136
and rather than thinking about sex
as a race to a goal,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.256
this helps us reconceptualize it
as a pool of experiences

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.896
that include warmth, affection, arousal,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.720
desire, touch, intimacy.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.856
And it's worth asking young people:

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.416
who's really the more sexually
experienced person?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.496
The one who makes out
with a partner for three hours

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.096
and experiments with sensual
tension and communication,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.936
or the one who gets wasted at a party
and hooks up with a random

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.640
in order to dump their "virginity"
before they get to college?

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.816
The only way that shift
in thinking can happen though

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.896
is if we talk to young people
more about sex --

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.256
if we normalize those discussions,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.176
integrating them into everyday life,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.736
talking about those intimate acts
in a different way --

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.536
the way we mostly have changed

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.200
in the way that we talk
about women in the public realm.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.296
Consider a survey
of 300 randomly chosen girls

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.696
from a Dutch and an American university,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.456
two similar universities,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.400
talking about their early
experience of sex.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.216
The Dutch girls embodied everything
we say we want from our girls.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.176
They had fewer negative consequences,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.040
like disease, pregnancy, regret --

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.416
more positive outcomes

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.856
like being able to communicate
with their partner,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.576
who they said they knew very well;

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.176
preparing for the experience responsibly;

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.760
enjoying themselves.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.880
What was their secret?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.976
The Dutch girls said
that their doctors, teachers and parents

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.616
talked to them candidly,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.376
from an early age,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.320
about sex, pleasure
and the importance of mutual trust.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.696
What's more,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.496
while American parents weren't necessarily
less comfortable talking about sex,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.016
we tend to frame those conversations

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.640
entirely in terms or risk and danger,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.280
whereas Dutch parents talk
about balancing responsibility and joy.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.416
I have to tell you,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.296
as a parent myself,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.376
that hit me hard,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.936
because I know,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.216
had I not delved into that research,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.016
I would have talked to my own child
about contraception,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.896
about disease protection,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.656
about consent because I'm a modern parent,

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.014
and I would have thought ...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.200
job well done.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.600
Now I know that's not enough.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.960
I also know what I hope for for our girls.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.216
I want them to see sexuality
as a source of self-knowledge,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.456
creativity and communication,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.096
despite its potential risks.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.576
I want them to be able
to revel in their bodies' sensuality

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.120
without being reduced to it.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.336
I want them to be able
to ask for what they want in bed,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.600
and to get it.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.016
I want them to be safe
from unwanted pregnancy,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.256
disease,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.496
cruelty,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.096
dehumanization,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.320
violence.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.856
If they are assaulted,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.336
I want them to have recourse
from their schools,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.776
their employers,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.000
the courts.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.520
It's a lot to ask,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.440
but it's not too much.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.536
As parents, teachers,
advocates and activists,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.336
we have raised a generation
of girls to have a voice,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.216
to expect egalitarian
treatment in the home,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.496
in the classroom,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.720
in the workplace.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.376
Now it's time to demand
that intimate justice

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.560
in their personal lives as well.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.976
Thank you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.600
(Applause)
