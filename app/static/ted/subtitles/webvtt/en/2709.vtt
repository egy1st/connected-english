00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.576
Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.896
how we define them

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.176
and how they, almost as revenge,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.456
define us.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.536
The English language
is a magnificent sponge.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.216
I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.816
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.280
which is the hunger for disaster.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.296
You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.606
and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.016
In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" --

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.056
I'm not pronouncing that correctly --

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.776
which means the longing
to feel intensely again

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800
the way you did when you were a kid.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.816
In Polish, they have a word "jouska"

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.376
which is the kind of
hypothetical conversation

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.520
that you compulsively
play out in your head.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.536
And finally, in German,
of course in German,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.416
they have a word called "zielschmerz"

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.856
which is the dread
of getting what you want.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.976
(Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.960
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.096
I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.736
Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.416
as I go about my day,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.576
but I'm really glad they exist.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.336
But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.976
I am the author of "The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.096
which I've been writing
for the last seven years.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.136
And the whole mission of the project

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.336
is to find holes
in the language of emotion

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.576
and try to fill them

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.496
so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.936
and quirks of the human condition

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.936
that we all feel
but may not think to talk about

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.656
because we don't have the words to do it.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.096
And about halfway through this project,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.736
I defined "sonder,"

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.136
the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.816
and everyone else is just extras.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.536
But in reality,
we're all the main character,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.639
and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.256
And so as soon as I published that,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.976
I got a lot of response from people

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.616
saying, "Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.656
but there was no word for that."

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440
So it made them feel less alone.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.960
That's the power of words,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.640
to make us feel less alone.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.136
And it was not long after that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.936
that I started to notice sonder

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.256
being used earnestly
in conversations online,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.176
and not long after I actually noticed it,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.696
I caught it next to me
in an actual conversation in person.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.176
There is no stranger feeling
than making up a word

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.496
and then seeing it
take on a mind of its own.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.616
I don't have a word
for that yet, but I will.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.056
(Laughter)

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.280
I'm working on it.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.280
I started to think
about what makes words real,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.056
because a lot of people ask me,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.416
the most common thing
I got from people is,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.696
"Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.776
And I didn't really know what to tell them

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.736
because once sonder started to take off,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.440
who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.216
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.696
as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.736
we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.856
and just sort of get on with things.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.440
But once you realize that people --

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.056
that this world was built
by people no smarter than you,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.176
then you can reach out
and touch those walls

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.896
and even put your hand through them

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280
and realize that you have
the power to change it.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.736
And when people ask me,
"Are these words real?"

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.856
I had a variety of answers
that I tried out.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.016
Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.616
But one of them I tried out was,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.176
"Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.416
The way that this path is real
because people wanted it to be there.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.136
(Laughter)

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.256
It happens on college
campuses all the time.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.616
It's called a "desire path."

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.656
(Laughter)

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.016
But then I decided,
what people are really asking

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.936
when they're asking if a word is real,
they're really asking,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.279
"Well, how many brains
will this give me access to?"

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.816
Because I think that's
a lot of how we look at language.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.616
A word is essentially a key

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.616
that gets us into certain people's heads.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.080
And if it gets us into one brain,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.176
it's not really worth it,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.456
not really worth knowing.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.936
Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.160
A million brains, OK, now we're talking.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.256
And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.536
That's what makes it worth knowing.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.376
Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.616
[O.K.]

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.856
That's it.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.136
The realest word we have.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.736
That is the closest thing we have
to a master key.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.336
That's the most commonly
understood word in the world,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.616
no matter where you are.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.856
The problem with that is,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.576
no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.896
(Laughter)

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.976
Which is kind of weird, right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.456
I mean, it could be a misspelling
of "all correct," I guess,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.736
or "old kinderhook."

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.616
No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.136
says something about
how we add meaning to words.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.960
The meaning is not
in the words themselves.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.680
We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.200
And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.896
and searching for the meaning of life,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.160
I think words have
something to do with that.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.816
And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.840
the dictionary is a decent place to start.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.136
It brings a sense of order

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.920
to a very chaotic universe.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.720
Our view of things is so limited

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.336
that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.656
and try to figure out
a way to interpret it

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.520
and be able to get on with our day.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.520
We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.440
I think a lot of us feel boxed in

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.896
by how we use these words.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.256
We forget that words are made up.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.640
It's not just my words.
All words are made up,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.960
but not all of them mean something.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.976
We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.736
that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.376
and so I think I feel us drifting apart
a little more every year,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.480
the more seriously we take words.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.680
Because remember, words are not real.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.640
They don't have meaning. We do.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.280
And I'd like to leave you with a reading

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.376
from one of my favorite philosophers,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.936
Bill Watterson, who created
"Calvin and Hobbes."

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.160
He said,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.856
"Creating a life that reflects
your values and satisfies your soul

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.536
is a rare achievement.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.016
To invent your own life's meaning

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.576
is not easy,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.416
but it is still allowed,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.640
and I think you'll be
happier for the trouble."

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.536
Thank you.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.280
(Applause)
