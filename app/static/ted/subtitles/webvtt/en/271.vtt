00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, I'm in Chile,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I have this picture up on my screen,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and a woman comes up behind me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And, you know, "Excuse me!"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I could sense

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
(Laughter)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
taking pictures of penguins.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, literally, a few minutes before that,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I downloaded this scientific paper

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
about calculations on avian defecation,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which is really quite interesting, because it turns out

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and you can learn an awful lot

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about the physics of the avian rectum.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
At this point, she stops me,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and she says, "Who are you?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Wha -- what do you do?"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I was stuck,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so, in some sense,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this talk today

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is my answer to that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
so I'm not sure that you can.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
often at four in the morning.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, some people are afraid of what I do.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and in response, I have ordered

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a bulletproof pocket protector.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm not sure what these people think,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because I don't speak Norsk.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I don't know, you know?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, one of the things that I love to do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to study past civilizations,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and see where they succeeded

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and where they failed.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Use science to, you know,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And recently, I was in Easter Island,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is an incredibly beautiful place,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and an incredibly mysterious place,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because no matter where you go in Easter Island,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
you're struck by these statues, called the moai.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The place is 64 square miles.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Why on Earth? And if you haven't read

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I totally recommend that you do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He's got a great chapter about it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Basically, these people

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
committed ecological suicide

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in order to make more of these.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And somewhere along the line, somebody said,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"I know! Let's cut down the last tree

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and commit suicide, because

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we need more identical statues."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Where did they get that inspiration?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And then I met Yoyo,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and if you look at Yoyo's face,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
you kind of figure out where they got it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There's many mysteries, these statues.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
how did they transport them?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and she has detailed records of every single statue.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, this used to be completely smooth.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But after 1,000 years out in the weather,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
they look like this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
first because it's a way of preserving them.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
learn a few of the mysteries about them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
How long have they been standing in what positions?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
what caused them to be the way they are.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
so you get a gratuitous picture

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of a moai with a comet.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I also have an archaeological project going on

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in Egypt.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We're trying to get all of the permissions

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to get everything all set, to get it going.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Not a joke.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This is the conventional

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
nuclear fuel cycle.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The red line is what is done in

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where you reprocess.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, this is the normal way it's done.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's got the huge advantage that it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
does not create carbon pollution.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It has a lot of disadvantages:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
each one of these steps is extremely expensive,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it's potentially dangerous

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and they have the interesting property that the step

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which is a problem.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So, our reactor eliminates these steps,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
There's -- no reactor's been even built

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
for 25 years.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
thing that we do.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Changing into a totally different field,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
particularly in an area called metamaterials.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
A metamaterial is an artificial material,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
this is how you would view it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
come in, and they just squish around the cell,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and they come back the other side.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Metamaterials, unfortunately --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A, it only works on microwave,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
it's a zero billion dollar business, but,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in fact, it's negative.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
diseases in developing countries.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and went to a chef school in France.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I used to work, also while at Microsoft,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
at a leading restaurant in Seattle,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
so I do a lot of cooking.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I've been on a team that won

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the world championship of barbecue.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
like chili, or bouillabaisse.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Various parts of the world will have a cult food

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that people get enormously attached to --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And I'm trying to use a very

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
scientific approach.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So, this is my latest cooker,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that's because it is.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you can make some terrific ribs.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is a high-speed centrifuge.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You should all have one in your kitchen,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
beside your Turbochef.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that of normal gravity,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You would not believe it!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I perform a series of ghoulish experiments

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
on food --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so that one can predict exactly

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what the internal cooking times are.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Theory is red,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
black is experiment.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So, I'm either really good at faking it,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or this particular model seems to work.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, another random thing I do

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
or SETI.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
which sort of popularized that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It turns out there are real people who go out

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
In fact, almost everybody in the movie

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
is based on a real character, a real person.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So, the Jodie Foster character here

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and Jill has dedicated her life to this.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You know, a lot of people risk their lives

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in a brief act of heroism,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
which is kind of cool,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but Jill has

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
what I call slow heroism.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
She is risking her professional life on something

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that her own calculations show

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
My kids saw the movie,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and afterwards they came to me and they said,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"So, Dad, so -- so --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that character -- that's Jill, right?"

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Is that you?"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Laughter)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So, the SETI Institute,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and a variety of other people,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is building a dedicated radio telescope

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in Hat Creek, California,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
so they can do this SETI work.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and the one person who always gets updated

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is Jill, because I really don't want to miss

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
"the call."

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
(Laughter)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And I resemble that remark.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
which is the finding of them.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
looking for a dinosaur.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's horrible conditions, because

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
wherever you have nice weather,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
plants grow,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, you always find dinosaurs

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
in deserts or badlands,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
areas that have very little plant growth

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and have flash floods in the spring.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
You know, skiers pray for snow?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Paleontologists pray for erosion.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So, you hike around

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You hike around, you see something like this.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You've got this bentonite clay,


00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which is -- sort of swells up and expands.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and you look up close, and you say,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
from the shape, that these are skull fragments.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And then when you look at this,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
you say, "That's a tooth.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's a big tooth."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It's about the size of a banana.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It has a big serration on the edge.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and I don't have room for two.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You know.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
is that it is both an intellectual thing,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
because you're trying to reconstruct the environment

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
of millions of years ago.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It's something that can inform all sorts of science

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
in unexpected ways.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The study of dinosaurs led to the realization

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that there's a problem with asteroid impact,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
for example.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The study of dinosaurs may, literally,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
one day save the planet.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Study of the ancient climate is very important.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
had much higher CO2 than today,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
for the effects of CO2 on climate.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But, besides being intellectually

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and scientifically interesting, it's also very different

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
so we're not going to go into it further.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now, I'm also really big on photography.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I travel all over the world taking pictures --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
some of them good, most of them not.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
you've got to spend more time sorting through them.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
of king penguins on a beach.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and we had looked for a week,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And the last day, the sun comes out,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I get lots of pictures like this.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Then, a little bit later,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I start getting some pictures like this.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
this would be the centerfold.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It's true.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So, there's more and more activity near the boat,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and all of a sudden somebody shouts,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
"What's that in the water?"

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
(Laughter)

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
The first thing you learn

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
is the overwhelming importance of hands.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
They don't have them.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I think Paul Simon is in the audience,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and he has --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
"Slip-Slidin' Away."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
That's kind of what it's like.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
they curl their toes too.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Laughter)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in finding a great thing, passion in life,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and focusing all your energy on it,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and I've never been able to do that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I just -- you know, because, yes,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I'll focus passion on something,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And you know, when I was at Microsoft,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that was so engrossing,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and the whole industry was expanding so much,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But ultimately,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I decided

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but embrace it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And say, "Yeah, you know, I --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
but that's really what works for me."

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
or metamaterials or whale sex,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
That's it, thank you.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
(Applause)
