WEBVTT

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:04.676
What if I told you
there was a new technology

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.268
that, when placed in the hands
of doctors and nurses,

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:14.435
improved outcomes for children
and adults, patients of all ages;

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:18.034
reduced pain and suffering,

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:21.247
reduced time in the operating rooms,

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.124
reduced anesthetic times,

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:26.046
had the ultimate dose-response curve

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.816
that the more you did it,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.162
the better it benefitted patients?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.742
Here's a kicker: it has no side effects,

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.783
and it's available no matter
where care is delivered.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.947
I can tell you as an ICU doctor
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.278
this would be a game changer for me.

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:47.935
That technology is lifelike rehearsal.

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:53.259
This lifelike rehearsal is being delivered
through medical simulation.

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:57.892
I thought I would start with a case,

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.626
just to really describe
the challenge ahead,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.021
and why this technology is not just
going to improve health care

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:06.735
but why it's critical to health care.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.441
This is a child that's born, young girl.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:12.225
"Day of life zero," we call it,

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.548
the first day of life,
just born into the world.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:15.963
And just as she's being born,

00:01:15.987 --> 00:01:18.419
we notice very quickly
that she is deteriorating.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.852
Her heart rate is going up,
her blood pressure is going down,

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.518
she's breathing very, very fast.

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:29.179
And the reason for this
is displayed in this chest X-ray.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.514
That's called a babygram,

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:33.812
a full X-ray of a child's body,
a little infant's body.

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:35.742
As you look on the top side of this,

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.249
that's where the heart and lungs
are supposed to be.

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:41.050
As you look at the bottom end,
that's where the abdomen is,

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:43.496
and that's where the intestines
are supposed to be.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.249
And you can see how
there's sort of that translucent area

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.444
that made its way up into the right side
of this child's chest.

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:53.476
And those are the intestines --
in the wrong place.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.670
As a result, they're pushing on the lungs

00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:58.665
and making it very difficult
for this poor baby to breathe.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.711
The fix for this problem

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:03.389
is to take this child immediately
to the operating room,

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.544
bring those intestines
back into the abdomen,

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:06.983
let the lungs expand

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:08.888
and allow this child to breathe again.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:11.546
But before she can go
to the operating room,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.862
she must get whisked away
to the ICU, where I work.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.754
I work with surgical teams.

00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:18.080
We gather around her,

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:22.205
and we place this child
on heart-lung bypass.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.217
We put her to sleep,

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.837
we make a tiny
little incision in the neck,

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.999
we place catheters into the major
vessels of the neck --

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:34.717
and I can tell you that these vessels
are about the size of a pen,

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.646
the tip of a pen --

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.754
and then we have blood
drawn from the body,

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:41.186
we bring it through a machine,
it gets oxygenated,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.062
and it goes back into the body.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.662
We save her life,

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:47.210
and get her safely to the operating room.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.328
Here's the problem:

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.445
these disorders --

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.758
what is known is congenital
diaphragmatic hernia --

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:00.378
this hole in the diaphragm that has
allowed these intestines to sneak up --

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.368
these disorders are rare.

00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:07.118
Even in the best hands in the world,

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:10.652
there is still a challenge
to get the volume --

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:12.574
the natural volume of these patients --

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:15.120
in order to get our expertise
curve at 100 percent.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.244
They just don't present that often.

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.635
So how do you make the rare common?

00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.398
Here's the other problem:

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.960
in the health care system
that I trained for over 20 years,

00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:32.169
what currently exists,

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:35.137
the model of training is called
the apprenticeship model.

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.076
It's been around for centuries.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.048
It's based on this idea that you see
a surgery maybe once,

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.600
maybe several times,

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:45.414
you then go do that surgery,

00:03:45.438 --> 00:03:48.996
and then ultimately you teach
that surgery to the next generation.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:53.192
And implicit in this model --

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.390
I don't need to tell you this --

00:03:55.414 --> 00:04:00.371
is that we practice on the very patients
that we are delivering care to.

00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:03.982
That's a problem.

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:09.473
I think there's a better approach.

00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:13.862
Medicine may very well be the last
high-stakes industry

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.608
that does not practice prior to game time.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.490
I want to describe to you a better
approach through medical simulation.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.696
Well, the first thing we did is we went
to other high-stakes industries

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.590
that had been using this type
of methodology for decades.

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.279
This is nuclear power.

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:36.344
Nuclear power runs scenarios
on a regular basis

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:39.585
in order to practice
what they hope will never occur.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.960
And as we're all very familiar,
the airline industry --

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:47.281
we all get on planes now,
comforted by the idea

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:53.101
that pilots and crews have trained
on simulators much like these,

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.686
training on scenarios
that we hope will never occur,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.890
but we know if they did,

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:00.427
they would be prepared for the worst.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.335
In fact, the airline industry has gone
as far as to create fuselages

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:06.902
of simulation environments,

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:10.167
because of the importance
of the team coming together.

00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:13.077
This is an evacuation drill simulator.

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:17.573
So again, if that ever were to happen,
these rare, rare events,

00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:20.887
they're ready to act
on the drop of a dime.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:28.204
I guess the most compelling for me
in some ways is the sports industry --

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:29.860
arguably high stakes.

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:33.734
You think about a baseball team:
baseball players practice.

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:36.429
I think it's a beautiful example
of progressive training.

00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:39.213
The first thing they do
is go out to spring training.

00:05:39.237 --> 00:05:41.501
They go to a spring training camp,

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:44.044
perhaps a simulator in baseball.

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.614
They're not on the real field,
but they're on a simulated field,

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.671
and they're playing in the pregame season.

00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:53.192
Then they make their way to the field
during the season games,

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:56.314
and what's the first thing they do
before they start the game?

00:05:56.338 --> 00:06:00.769
They go into the batting cage
and do batting practice for hours,

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.124
having different types of pitches
being thrown at them,

00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:08.480
hitting ball after ball
as they limber their muscles,

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:10.477
getting ready for the game itself.

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.351
And here's the most
phenomenal part of this,

00:06:14.525 --> 00:06:17.025
and for all of you who watch
any sport event,

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:18.964
you will see this phenomenon happen.

00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:22.529
The batter gets into the batter's box,

00:06:22.553 --> 00:06:24.674
the pitcher gets ready to pitch.

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:27.804
Right before the pitch is thrown,

00:06:27.828 --> 00:06:29.037
what does that batter do?

00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:30.965
The batter steps out of the box

00:06:32.277 --> 00:06:34.320
and takes a practice swing.

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:36.169
He wouldn't do it any other way.

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:40.807
I want to talk to you about how
we're building practice swings like this

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.986
in medicine.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.192
We are building batting cages
for the patients that we care about

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:47.444
at Boston Children's.

00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:49.961
I want to use this case
that we recently built.

00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:54.755
It's the case of a four-year-old
who had a progressively enlarging head,

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.056
and as a result,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.212
had loss of developmental milestones,
neurologic milestones,

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:02.253
and the reason for this problem is here --

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.927
it's called hydrocephalus.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.423
So, a quick study in neurosurgery.

00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:08.612
There's the brain,

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.184
and you can see the cranium
surrounding the brain.

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.993
What surrounds the brain,
between the brain and cranium,

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.235
is something called
cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.993
which acts as a shock absorber.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:21.908
In your heads right now,

00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:25.189
there is cerebrospinal fluid
just bathing your brains

00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:27.039
and making its way around.

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.689
It's produced in one area
and flows through,

00:07:29.713 --> 00:07:31.004
and then is re-exchanged.

00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:33.925
And this beautiful flow pattern
occurs for all of us.

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:36.490
But unfortunately in some children,

00:07:36.514 --> 00:07:39.017
there's a blockage of this flow pattern,

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.593
much like a traffic jam.

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:43.888
As a result, the fluid accumulates,

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:46.428
and the brain is pushed aside.

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:48.964
It has difficulty growing.

00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:53.094
As a result, the child loses
neurologic milestones.

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:55.529
This is a devastating disease in children.

00:07:56.973 --> 00:08:00.047
The cure for this is surgery.

00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:02.981
The traditional surgery is to take
a bit of the cranium off,

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:04.163
a bit of the skull,

00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:07.130
drain this fluid out,
stick a drain in place,

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.882
and then eventually bring
this drain internal to the body.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.122
Big operation.

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:16.413
But some great news is that advances
in neurosurgical care

00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:20.146
have allowed us to develop
minimally invasive approaches

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.330
to this surgery.

00:08:21.354 --> 00:08:25.679
Through a small pinhole,
a camera can be inserted,

00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:29.660
led into the deep brain structure,

00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:33.637
and cause a little hole in a membrane
that allows all that fluid to drain,

00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.709
much like it would in a sink.

00:08:35.733 --> 00:08:38.848
All of a sudden, the brain
is no longer under pressure,

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:40.329
can re-expand

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.232
and we cure the child
through a single-hole incision.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:46.073
But here's the problem:

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:48.241
hydrocephalus is relatively rare.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.320
And there are no good training methods

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:54.968
to get really good at getting
this scope to the right place.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:59.306
But surgeons have been quite creative
about this, even our own.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.338
And they've come up with training models.

00:09:01.362 --> 00:09:03.087
Here's the current training model.

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:05.069
(Laughter)

00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:06.750
I kid you not.

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:09.213
This is a red pepper,
not made in Hollywood;

00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:10.565
it's real red pepper.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.947
And what surgeons do is they stick
a scope into the pepper,

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:17.069
and they do what is called a "seedectomy."

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:18.860
(Laughter)

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:24.984
They use this scope to remove seeds
using a little tweezer.

00:09:25.812 --> 00:09:28.440
And that is a way to get under their belts

00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:31.460
the rudimentary components
of doing this surgery.

00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:34.552
Then they head right into
the apprenticeship model,

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:37.448
seeing many of them
as they present themselves,

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:39.735
then doing it, and then teaching it --

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.776
waiting for these patients to arrive.

00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:44.066
We can do a lot better.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.817
We are manufacturing
reproductions of children

00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.747
in order for surgeons and surgical
teams to rehearse

00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:55.151
in the most relevant possible ways.

00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:56.550
Let me show you this.

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:58.654
Here's my team

00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:02.583
in what's called the SIM Engineering
Division of the Simulator Program.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.163
This is an amazing team of individuals.

00:10:06.187 --> 00:10:08.462
They are mechanical engineers;

00:10:08.486 --> 00:10:10.911
you're seeing here, illustrators.

00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:15.507
They take primary data
from CT scans and MRIs,

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:18.861
translate it into digital information,

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:20.191
animate it,

00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:25.006
put it together into the components
of the child itself,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.824
surface-scan elements of the child
that have been casted as needed,

00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:31.433
depending on the surgery itself,

00:10:31.457 --> 00:10:35.348
and then take this digital data
and be able to output it

00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:39.120
on state-of-the-art,
three-dimensional printing devices

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:41.414
that allow us to print the components

00:10:41.438 --> 00:10:47.106
exactly to the micron detail of what
the child's anatomy will look like.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.434
You can see here,

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.892
the skull of this child being printed

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.402
in the hours before
we performed this surgery.

00:10:54.618 --> 00:10:57.194
But we could not do this work

00:10:57.218 --> 00:11:01.605
without our dear friends on the West Coast
in Hollywood, California.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.010
These are individuals
that are incredibly talented

00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:08.458
at being able to recreate reality.

00:11:08.482 --> 00:11:12.906
It was not a long leap for us.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.506
The more we got into this field,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.290
the more it became clear to us
that we are doing cinematography.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.867
We're doing filmmaking,

00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:23.115
it's just that the actors are not actors.

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:26.405
They're real doctors and nurses.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.569
So these are some photos
of our dear friends at Fractured FX

00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.062
in Hollywood California,

00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:35.660
an Emmy-Award-winning
special effects firm.

00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:38.854
This is Justin Raleigh and his group --

00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:40.526
this is not one of our patients --

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.908
(Laughter)

00:11:41.932 --> 00:11:45.000
but kind of the exquisite work
that these individuals do.

00:11:45.024 --> 00:11:48.628
We have now collaborated
and fused our experience,

00:11:48.652 --> 00:11:51.058
bringing their group
to Boston Children's Hospital,

00:11:51.082 --> 00:11:53.738
sending our group
out to Hollywood, California

00:11:53.762 --> 00:11:55.131
and exchanging around this

00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:58.158
to be able to develop
these type of simulators.

00:11:58.182 --> 00:12:02.651
What I'm about to show you
is a reproduction of this child.

00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:12.300
You'll notice here that every hair
on the child's head is reproduced.

00:12:12.324 --> 00:12:16.027
And in fact, this is also
that reproduced child --

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:19.244
and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,

00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:22.128
but that is a reproduction and simulation

00:12:22.152 --> 00:12:24.246
of the child they're about to operate on.

00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:28.931
Here's that membrane we had talked about,

00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:31.114
the inside of this child's brain.

00:12:31.538 --> 00:12:36.506
What you're going to be seeing here
is, on one side, the actual patient,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.809
and on the other side, the simulator.

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:43.183
As I mentioned, a scope, a little camera,
needs to make its way down,

00:12:43.207 --> 00:12:44.608
and you're seeing that here.

00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:46.956
It needs to make a small hole
in this membrane

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.689
and allow this fluid to seep out.

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:55.796
I won't do a quiz show to see
who thinks which side is which,

00:12:56.962 --> 00:12:59.266
but on the right is the simulator.

00:13:00.683 --> 00:13:04.481
So surgeons can now produce
training opportunities,

00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.558
do these surgeries
as many times as they want,

00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:10.424
to their heart's content,
until they feel comfortable.

00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:14.013
And then, and only then,
bring the child into the operating room.

00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:15.206
But we don't stop here.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.540
We know that a key step to this
is not just the skill itself,

00:13:19.564 --> 00:13:24.095
but combining that skill with a team
who's going to deliver that care.

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:26.461
Now we turn to Formula One.

00:13:27.025 --> 00:13:30.275
And here is an example
of a technician putting on a tire

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:33.508
and doing that time and time
again on this car.

00:13:33.532 --> 00:13:36.517
But that is very quickly
going to be incorporated

00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:38.472
within team-training experiences,

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:42.705
now as a full team orchestrating
the exchange of tires

00:13:42.729 --> 00:13:45.727
and getting this car back on the speedway.

00:13:46.274 --> 00:13:49.551
We've done that step in health care,

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.697
so now what you're about to see
is a simulated operation.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.147
We've taken the simulator
I just described to you,

00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:00.572
we've brought it into the operating room
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:14:00.596 --> 00:14:04.251
and these individuals --
these native teams, operative teams --

00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:07.798
are doing the surgery before the surgery.

00:14:07.822 --> 00:14:09.559
Operate twice;

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:10.789
cut once.

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:12.515
Let me show that to you.

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:16.530
(Video) Surgical team member 1:
You want the head down or head up?

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:18.258
STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?

00:14:18.282 --> 00:14:20.931
STM 3: And then lower
the whole table down a little bit?

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:22.209
STM 4: Table coming down.

00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:27.561
STM 3: All right, this
is behaving like a vessel.

00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:29.672
Could we have the scissors back, please?

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:32.997
STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,
8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.

00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:35.422
STM 6: Great! Thank you.

00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:38.169
Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:40.285
The second step to this,
which is critical,

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.408
is we take these teams out
immediately and debrief them.

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:44.896
We use the same technologies

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.608
that are used in Lean
and Six Sigma in the military,

00:14:49.632 --> 00:14:52.717
and we bring them out
and talk about what went right,

00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:54.386
but more importantly,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.877
we talk about what didn't go well,

00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:58.836
and how we're going to fix it.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.614
Then we bring them right back in
and do it again.

00:15:01.638 --> 00:15:06.829
Deliberative batting practice
in the moments when it matters most.

00:15:08.438 --> 00:15:10.460
Let's go back to this case now.

00:15:11.083 --> 00:15:12.460
Same child,

00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:14.874
but now let me describe
how we care for this child

00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:16.361
at Boston Children's Hospital.

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.871
This child was born
at three o'clock in the morning.

00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:20.902
At two o'clock in the morning,

00:15:20.926 --> 00:15:23.052
we assembled the team,

00:15:23.076 --> 00:15:24.877
and took the reproduced anatomy

00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:28.606
that we would gain
out of scans and images,

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.396
and brought that team
to the virtual bedside,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.007
to a simulated bedside --

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:36.572
the same team that's going to operate
on this child in the hours ahead --

00:15:36.596 --> 00:15:38.979
and we have them do the procedure.

00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:41.271
Let me show you a moment of this.

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:44.372
This is not a real incision.

00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:47.651
And the baby has not yet been born.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.481
Imagine this.

00:15:52.133 --> 00:15:56.021
So now the conversations
that I have with families

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.745
in the intensive care unit
at Boston Children's Hospital

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:00.157
are totally different.

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.498
Imagine this conversation:

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:08.500
"Not only do we take care of this disorder
frequently in our ICU,

00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:10.702
and not only have we done surgeries

00:16:10.726 --> 00:16:13.161
like the surgery we're going
to do on your child,

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:16.899
but we have done your child's surgery.

00:16:17.956 --> 00:16:20.486
And we did it two hours ago.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.242
And we did it 10 times.

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:27.087
And now we're prepared to take them
back to the operating room."

00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:31.061
So a new technology in health care:

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:35.035
lifelike rehearsal.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:38.613
Practicing prior to game time.

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:40.812
Thank you.

00:16:40.836 --> 00:16:45.501
(Applause)
