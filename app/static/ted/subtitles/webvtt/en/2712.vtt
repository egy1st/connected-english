WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.976
We all have milestones in life
that we remember so vividly.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.616
The first one for me
was when I was entering kindergarten.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
My big brother was in school,
and by golly, it was my time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.256
And I went trottin' down that hallway.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.760
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.096
And I go to the door,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.736
and there was the teacher
with a warm welcome,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.896
and she took me into the classroom,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.496
showed me my little cubbyhole --

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.136
we all remember those
little cubbyholes, don't we --

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.600
and we put our stuff in there.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.216
And then she said, "Go over to the circle

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.520
and play with the kids
until class starts."

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.616
So I went over there
and plopped down like I owned the place,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.056
and I'm playing,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.985
and all of a sudden, the boy next to me,

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.056
he was wearing a white shirt
with blue shorts.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.800
I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.496
Suddenly he stopped playing and he said,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.120
"Why are you so short?"

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.816
And I just kept playing.
I didn't think he was talking to me.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.856
(Laughter)

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.696
And in a louder voice, he said,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.000
"Hey, why are you so short?"

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.016
So I looked up and I said,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.736
"What are you talking about?
Let's just play. We're happy.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.120
I've been waiting for this."

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.096
And so we played,
and about a minute later,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.776
the girl next to him,
in a white shirt and a pink skirt,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.536
stood up, put her hands on her hips,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.600
and said, "Yeah,
why do you look so different?"

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.456
And I went, "What are you talking about?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.840
I don't look different. I'm not short.
Again, let's just play."

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.016
About this time, I looked
all around the circle I was in,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.400
and all the kids had stopped playing
and they were all looking at me.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.696
And I'm thinking --

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.496
in today's language,
it would be "OMG" or "WTF."

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.160
(Laughter)

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.080
What just happened?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.856
So all the confidence
that I went in with that morning

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.216
was withering away as the morning went on

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.920
and the questions kept coming.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.176
And at the end of the morning,
before I went home,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.136
the teacher had us in a circle,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.856
and I actually found myself
outside of the circle.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.216
I couldn't look at anybody.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.880
I could not understand what just happened.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.936
And over the next few years,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.056
I hated to go out in public.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.976
I felt every stare, every giggle,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.656
every pointed finger,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.096
not the finger,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.056
but every pointed finger,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.336
and I hated it.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.280
I would hide behind my parents' legs
like nobody could see me.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.576
And as a child,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.936
you can't understand
another child's curiosity,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.720
nor an adult's ignorance.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.016
It became very apparent to me
that the real world was not built

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.040
for someone of my size,
both literally or figuratively.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.776
And so I have no anonymity,
as you can probably tell,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.536
and while you can see my size,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.056
we all go through many challenges
through our lifetime.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.056
And some you can see, like mine.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.656
Most you can't.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.656
You can't tell if someone's dealing
with a mental illness,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.256
or they're struggling
with their gender identity,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.816
they're caring for an aging parent,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.576
they're having financial difficulty.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.520
You can't see that kind of stuff.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.376
So while you can see

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.216
one of my challenges is my size,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.576
seeing does not mean you understand

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.416
what it's truly to be me on a daily basis,
or what I go through.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.896
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.056
I do not believe you can
walk in someone else's shoes,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.696
and because of that, we must adopt
a new way of giving of ourselves.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.616
Simply stated, I will never know
what it's like to be you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.456
and you will never know
what it's like to be me.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.256
I cannot face your fears
or chase your dreams,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.136
and you can't do that for me,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.680
but we can be supportive of each other.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.976
Instead of trying to walk
in each other's shoes,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.240
we must adopt a new way
of giving of ourselves.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.296
I learned at an early age

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.176
that I did have to do some things
different than most people,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.656
but I also learned there were things
I was on equal footing with,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.816
and one of those was the classroom.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.800
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.896
As a matter of fact,
I excelled in the classroom.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.495
This was vitally important,
I discovered as I grew older

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.816
and realized I wasn't going to be able
to do a physical job.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.680
I needed an education.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.176
So I went on and got a university degree,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.976
but I felt to be one step ahead
of everyone for employment,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.216
I needed to have
an advanced university degree,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.656
so I went ahead and got that.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.576
Now I'm ready for my interview.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.456
Remember your first interview?
What am I going to wear?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.696
What questions?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.520
And don't forget that firm handshake.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.776
I was right there with you.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.816
So 24 hours before my interview,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.376
a friend of mine
who I've known all my life

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.696
called and said, "Michele,
the building you're going in has steps."

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.896
And she knew I couldn't climb steps.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.776
So suddenly, my focus changed.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.240
In my shoes, I was worried
about how am I going to get there?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.576
So I went early and found a loading dock
and got in and had a great interview.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.560
They had no idea what I went through
for the day and that's OK.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.976
You're probably thinking my greatest
challenge that day was the interview,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.896
or getting in the building.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.536
In reality, my biggest challenge that day

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.465
was getting through the loading dock
without getting run over.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.160
I am very vulnerable
in certain situations:

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.296
airports, hallways, parking lots,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.520
loading docks.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.096
And so I have to be very careful.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.056
I have to anticipate and be flexible

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.400
and move as quickly as I can sometimes.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.696
So I got the job,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.776
and in my current role
I travel quite a bit.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.680
And travel is a challenge
for all of us these days.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.616
And so you probably get to the airport,
run through security, get to the gate.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.320
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?
Did I get my upgrade?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.376
Me, first of all,
I don't run through anything.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.576
(Laughter)

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.656
And I especially don't run through the TSA

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.520
because I get to experience
the personal patdown.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.336
I won't comment on that.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.336
And then I make my way to the gate,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.136
and with my gift of gab
that my parents said I was born with,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.776
I talk to the gate agent, and then I say,
"By the way, my scooter weighs this much,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.416
I have a dry cell battery,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.840
and I can drive it down
to the door of the plane."

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.016
Also, the day before, I had called
the city where I'm traveling to

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.200
to find out where I could rent a scooter
in case mine gets broken on the way.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.840
So in my shoes,
it's a little bit different.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.736
When I get onto the plane,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.200
I use my gift of gab to ask the lady
to put my bag up, and they graciously do.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.536
I try not to eat or drink on a plane

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.456
because I don't want to have to
get up and walk on the plane,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.056
but nature has its own schedule,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.656
and not long ago,
it knocked and I answered.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.056
So I walked up to the front of the plane

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.096
and gabbed with the flight attendant,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.440
and said, "Can you watch the door?
I can't reach the lock."

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.416
So I'm in there doing my business,
and the door flies open.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.000
And there's a gentleman there

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.416
with a look of horror on his face.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.821
I'm sure I had the same look.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.200
As I came out, I noticed
that he was sitting right across from me,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.400
and he's in total, complete embarrassment.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.816
So I walk up to him and I quietly go,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.136
"Are you going to remember this
as much as I am?"

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.840
(Laughter)

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.096
And he goes, "I think so."

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.776
(Laughter)

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.096
Now, while he's probably
not talking about it publicly, I am.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.936
(Laughter)

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.736
But we talked for the rest of the flight,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.656
and we got to know each other,
our families, sports, work,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.376
and when we landed, he said,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.576
"Michele, I noticed
someone put your bag up.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.816
Can I get that for you?"

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.520
And I said, "Of course, thank you."

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.576
And we wished each other well,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.496
and the most important thing that day

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.296
was that he was not going to leave
with that embarrassment,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.736
that experience of embarrassment.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.176
He won't forget it, and neither will I,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.456
but I think he will remember more

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.200
our chat and our different perspectives.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.216
When you travel internationally,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.816
it can be even more challenging
in certain ways.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.576
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.216
and I come wheeling in,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.440
and think about that.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.895
Short, white, blond woman in a chair.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.880
That doesn't probably happen every day.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.936
So I go up, and with my gift of gab,
I start to talk to the agent.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.376
So friendly, and I ask
about their culture and so forth,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.216
and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.176
So I had to kind of say,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.256
"Not only do you have to lift my chair,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.520
I could use some help
getting up the steps."

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.776
So we got to spend about an hour together
while we waited for the flight,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.656
and it was the most magnificent hour.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.136
Our perspective changed
for both of us that day.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.576
And once I got on the flight,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.536
he patted me on the back
and wished me well,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.776
and I thanked him so much.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.256
And again, I think he's going
to remember that experience more

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.840
than when I first came in,
and there was a bit of hesitation.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.856
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.816
I would not be where I am today

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.176
if it was not for my family,
my friends, my colleagues

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.896
and the many strangers

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.200
that help me every single day of my life.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.856
And it's important
that we all have a support system.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.496
Asking for help is a strength,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.736
not a weakness.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.320
(Applause)

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.776
We all need help throughout our lifetime,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.216
but it is just as important

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.656
that we are part
of other people's support systems.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.856
We must adopt that way of giving back.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.760
We all obviously have a role to play
in our own successes,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.176
but think about the role we have to play
in other people's successes,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.880
just like people do for me
every single day.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.536
It's vitally important
that we help each other,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.880
because society is increasingly
placing people in silos

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.560
based on biases and ideologies.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.120
And we must look past the surface

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.216
and be confronted with the truth

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.096
that none of us are what you can see.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.216
There's more to us than that,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.520
and we're all dealing with things
that you cannot see.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.216
So living a life free of judgment

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.576
allows all of us to share
those experiences together

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.656
and have a totally different perspective,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.360
just like the couple of people
I mentioned earlier in my stories.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.576
So remember, the only shoes

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.080
you truly can walk in are your own.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.680
I cannot walk in yours.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.256
I know you can't walk in my size 1s --

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.376
(Laughter)

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.600
but you can try.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.440
But we can do something better than that.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.776
With compassion,
courage and understanding,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.496
we can walk side by side

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.576
and support one another,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.256
and think about how society can change

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.936
if we all do that

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.400
instead of judging
on only what you can see.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.176
Thank you.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.880
(Applause)

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.280
Thank you.
