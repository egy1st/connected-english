WEBVTT

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.136
In the last couple of years,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.896
I have produced what I call
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.176
32 short films and counting
about dead malls.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.616
Now, for those of you who are
not familiar with what a dead mall is,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.056
it's basically a shopping mall

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.560
that has fallen into hard times.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.976
So it either has few shops
and fewer shoppers,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.240
or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.496
No sale at Penny's.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.336
(Laughter)

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.736
I started producing this series

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.080
in early 2015

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.096
after going through
kind of a dark period in my life

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.616
where I just didn't want
to create films anymore.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.880
I put my camera away

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.200
and I just stopped.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.520
So in 2015, I decided to make
a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.576
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.480
I should know because
I was there on opening day.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.896
I was there with my family,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.080
along with every other
family in Baltimore,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.656
and you had to drive around

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.376
for 45 minutes

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.176
just to find a parking spot.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.736
So if you can imagine,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.680
that's not happening at the malls today.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.816
My first mall job that I had as a teenager

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.376
was at a sporting goods store
called Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.616
Maybe you remember.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.536
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.136
You guys remember that?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.056
(Laughter)

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.896
I worked in a leather goods store,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.800
and I also worked in a video store,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.680
and not being one who was
very fond of the retail arts --

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.536
(Laughter)

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.416
I got fired from every single job.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.256
(Laughter)

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.480
In between these low-paying retail jobs,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.216
I did what any normal teenager did

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.440
in the 1990s.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.120
I shoplifted.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.295
I'm just kidding.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.216
I hung out with my friends at the mall.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.776
(Laughter)

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.816
Everyone's like, "Oh my God,
what kind of talk is this?"

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080
(Laughter)

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.416
Hanging out at the mall could be fun,
but it could be really lame, too,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.896
like sharing a cigarette
with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.056
who has put on
black lipstick for the night

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.040
while you're on your break
from your crappy minimum wage job.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.680
As I stand here today,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.800
Owings Mills has been gutted

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.802
and it's ready for the wrecking ball.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.136
The last time I was there,
it was in the evening,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.080
and it was about three days
before they closed the mall for good.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.096
And you kind of felt --

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.136
they never announced the mall was closing,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.776
but you had this sort of feeling,
this ominous feeling,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.576
that something big was going to happen,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.136
like it was the end of the road.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.696
It was a very creepy walk
through the mall.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.960
Let me show you.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.360
(Music)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.416
So when I started producing
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.176
I put the videos up onto YouTube,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.336
and while I thought they were interesting,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.936
frankly I didn't think others
would share the enthusiasm

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.400
for such a drab and depressing topic.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.616
But apparently I was wrong,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.696
because a lot of people
started to comment.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.600
And at first the comments were like --

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.496
basically like, "Oh my God,
that's the mall from my childhood.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.720
What happened?"

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.120
And then I would get comments
from people who were like,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.800
"There's a dead mall in my town.
You should come and film it."

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.056
So I started to travel around
the mid-Atlantic region

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.696
filming these dead malls.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.920
Some were open.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.080
Some were abandoned.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.536
It was kind of always hard
to get into the ones that were abandoned,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.056
but I somehow always found a way in.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.456
(Laughter)

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.536
The malls that are still open,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.176
they always do this weird thing --
like the dead malls.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.736
They'll have three stores left,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.776
but they try to spruce it up

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.136
to make it appear
like things are on the up-and-up.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.016
For example,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.056
you'll have an empty store

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.856
and they bring the gate down.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.056
So at Owings Mills, for example,
they put this tarp over the gate.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.336
Right?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.936
And it's got a stock photo

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.616
of a woman who is so happy

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.256
and she's holding a blouse,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.496
and she's like --

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.440
(Laughter)

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.776
And then there's a guy
standing next to her, with, like,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.056
an espresso cup, and he's like --

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.856
(Laughter)

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.640
And it says, "What brings you today?"

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.536
(Laughter)

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.736
I wanted to be scared and depressed.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.960
Thank you.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.080
So the comments just kept pouring in

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.296
on the videos,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.480
from all over the country,
and then all over the world.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.616
And I started to think,
this could really be something,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.936
but I had to get creative,
because I'm like,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.776
how long are people going to sit and watch
me waddling through an empty mall?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.560
(Laughter)

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.656
So the original episodes
I filmed with an iPhone.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.480
So I'd walk through the mall
with an iPhone, and, you know.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.176
Like that.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.656
(Laughter)

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.496
And security -- because malls,
they don't like photography --

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.256
so the security would come up and be like,
"Put that away," and I'm like, "OK."

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.616
So I had to get creative and sneaky,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.216
so I started using a hidden camera
and different techniques

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.856
to get the footage that I needed,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.016
and basically what I wanted to do

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.256
was make the video

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.616
like it was a first-person experience,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.680
like you are sitting --

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.736
put your headphones on
watching the screen --

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.656
it's like, you're there in the video,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.400
like a video game, basically.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.976
I also started to use music,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.256
collaborating with artists
who create music called vaporwave.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.216
And vaporwave is a music genre

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.216
that emerged in the early 2010s
among internet communities.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.536
Here's an example.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.880
(Music)

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.976
That's by an artist named Disconscious

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.176
from an album he did
called "Hologram Plaza."

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.856
So if you look that up,
you can hear more of those tunes.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.560
Vaporwave is more than an art form.
It's like a movement.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.520
It's nihilistic, it's angsty,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.856
but it's somehow comforting.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.096
The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing
with things you can't do anything about,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.256
like no jobs, or sitting in your parents'
basement eating ramen noodles.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.456
Vaporwave came out of this generation's
desire to express their hopelessness,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.216
the same way that
the pre-internet generation did

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.520
sitting around in the food court.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.560
One of my favorite malls

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.960
I've been to

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.616
is in Corpus Christi,
and it's called the Sunrise Mall.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.456
When I was a kid,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.536
my favorite thing to do was watch movies,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.496
and I used to watch movies
over and over and over again.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.080
And one of my favorite films
was "The Legend of Billie Jean."

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.376
Now, for those of you who have seen
"The Legend of Billie Jean,"

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.736
you'll know that it's a great film.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.976
I love it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.905
And Helen Slater and Christian Slater --

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:51.056
and if you didn't know,
they are not related.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.256
Many people thought that they
were brother and sister. They're not.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.656
But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used
in the film as a filming location.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.216
The mall is exactly the same
as it was in 1984.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.976
We're talking 32 years later.
Let me show you.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.496
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean
running across the fountain,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.360
being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.200
And she jumps over here.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.760
And you can see the shot right here
is what it looks like today.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.016
It's pretty incredible.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.080
I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.416
And there they are
falling in the fountain,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.776
and she runs up the stairs.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.640
This is a nice shot
of the whole thing here.

00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:43.216
Dan Bell: I love that so much.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.600
(Laughter)

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.736
I always think in my head,
if I owned a dead mall --

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.416
why don't they embrace their vintage look?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.640
Put in a bar,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.936
like, put vegan food in the food court

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.056
and invite millennials and hipsters

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.856
to come and drink and eat,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.816
and I guarantee you within three weeks

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.976
H&amp;M and Levi's will be banging
on the door trying to get space.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.736
I don't know why they don't do this,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.136
but apparently,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.616
it's only in my mind, it goes all day.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.000
(Laughter)

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.296
Anyway, in closing --

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.360
(Laughter)

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.480
When they first asked me to do this talk,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.840
I said,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.136
"Do you have the right person?"

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.440
(Laughter)

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.296
These talks are supposed
to be kind of inspiring and --

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.960
(Laughter)

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.416
I remembered something, though.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.960
I put my camera down
three or four years ago,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.456
and it took going to these malls

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.120
for me to be inspired again.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.296
And to see my audience

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.216
and people from all over the world
writing me and saying,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.456
"God, I love your videos,"

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.400
is incredible.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.976
I don't know how to even explain it,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.376
as an artist,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.296
how fulfilling that is.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.440
If you would have told me a year ago

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.440
that I would be standing on this stage

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.336
talking to all of you wonderful people,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.856
I would have never believed it.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.296
I am humbled

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.600
and so appreciative.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.376
Thank you very much.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.800
