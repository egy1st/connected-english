WEBVTT

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.815
Well, as many of you know,

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.221
the results of the recent
election were as follows:

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.776
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.696
won a landslide victory

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.800
with 52 percent of the overall vote.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.776
Jill Stein, the Green candidate,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.400
came a distant second, with 19 percent.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.536
Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.840
was hot on her heels with 14 percent,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.096
and the remainder of the vote
were shared between abstainers

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.160
and Gary Johnson,
the Libertarian candidate.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.830
(Laughter)

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.280
Now, what parallel universe
do you suppose I live in?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.776
Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.600
I live in the world,
and that is how the world voted.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.800
So let me take you back
and explain what I mean by that.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.016
In June this year,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.200
I launched something
called the Global Vote.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.880
And the Global Vote
does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.296
For the first time in history,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.056
it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
vote in the elections
of other people's countries.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.326
Now, why would you do that?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.736
What's the point?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.096
Well, let me show you what it looks like.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.520
You go to a website,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.086
rather a beautiful website,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.656
and then you select an election.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.720
Here's a bunch that we've already covered.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.096
We do about one a month, or thereabouts.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.936
So you can see Bulgaria,
the United States of America,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.456
Secretary-General of the United Nations,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.416
the Brexit referendum at the end there.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.216
You select the election
that you're interested in,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.496
and you pick the candidates.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.456
These are the candidates
from the recent presidential election

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.576
in the tiny island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.976
199,000 inhabitants,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.381
off the coast of West Africa.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.016
And then you can look at the brief summary
of each of those candidates

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.536
which I dearly hope is very neutral,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.376
very informative and very succinct.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.720
And when you've found
the one you like, you vote.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.176
These were the candidates

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.056
in the recent Icelandic
presidential election,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.366
and that's the way it goes.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.640
So why on earth would you want to vote
in another country's election?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.816
Well, the reason
that you wouldn't want to do it,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.056
let me reassure you,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.976
is in order to interfere in the democratic
processes of another country.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.656
That's not the purpose at all.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.096
In fact, you can't,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.576
because usually what I do
is I release the results

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.136
after the electorate in each
individual country has already voted,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.976
so there's no way that we could
interfere in that process.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.376
But more importantly,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.976
I'm not particularly interested

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.256
in the domestic issues
of individual countries.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.840
That's not what we're voting on.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.616
So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton
proposed to do for the Americans

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.656
is frankly none of our business.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.696
That's something that only
the Americans can vote on.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.256
No, in the global vote,
you're only considering one aspect of it,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480
which is what are those leaders
going to do for the rest of us?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.136
And that's so very important
because we live,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.576
as no doubt you're sick
of hearing people tell you,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.840
in a globalized, hyperconnected,
massively interdependent world

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.616
where the political decisions
of people in other countries

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.856
can and will have an impact on our lives

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.120
no matter who we are,
no matter where we live.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.296
Like the wings of the butterfly

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.616
beating on one side of the Pacific

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.176
that can apparently create
a hurricane on the other side,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.856
so it is with the world
that we live in today

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.576
and the world of politics.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.800
There is no longer a dividing line between
domestic and international affairs.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.336
Any country, no matter how small,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.416
even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.976
could produce the next Nelson Mandela

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.200
or the next Stalin.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.616
They could pollute the atmosphere
and the oceans, which belong to all of us,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.560
or they could be responsible
and they could help all of us.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.696
And yet, the system is so strange

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.416
because the system hasn't caught up
with this globalized reality.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.656
Only a small number of people
are allowed to vote for those leaders,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.736
even though their impact is gigantic

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960
and almost universal.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.456
What number was it?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.016
140 million Americans voted

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.296
for the next president
of the United States,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.255
and yet, as all of us knows,
in a few weeks time,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.896
somebody is going to hand over
the nuclear launch codes

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.120
to Donald J. Trump.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.536
Now, if that isn't having
a potential impact on all of us,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.760
I don't know what is.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.240
Similarly, the election
for the referendum on the Brexit vote,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.616
a small number of millions
of British people voted on that,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.336
but the outcome of the vote,
whichever way it went,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.056
would have had a significant impact

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.496
on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions
of people around the world.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
And yet, only a tiny number could vote.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.440
What kind of democracy is that?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.336
Huge decisions that affect all of us

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.216
being decided by relatively
very small numbers of people.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.576
And I don't know about you,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760
but I don't think
that sounds very democratic.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.136
So I'm trying to clear it up.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.616
But as I say,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.496
we don't ask about domestic questions.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.576
In fact, I only ever ask two questions
of all of the candidates.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.096
I send them the same
two questions every single time.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.536
I say, one,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.696
if you get elected, what are you
going to do for the rest of us,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.136
for the remainder of the seven billion
who live on this planet?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.096
Second question:

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.336
What is your vision
for your country's future in the world?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.920
What role do you see it playing?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.680
Every candidate,
I send them those questions.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.456
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.256
I reckon if you're standing

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.656
to become the next president
of the United States,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.056
you're probably pretty tied up
most of the time,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.136
so I'm not altogether surprised
that they don't all answer, but many do.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.656
More every time.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.736
And some of them do much more than answer.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.896
Some of them answer in the most
enthusiastic and most exciting way

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.136
you could imagine.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.656
I just want to say a word here
for Saviour Chishimba,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.096
who was one of the candidates

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.376
in the recent Zambian
presidential election.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.936
His answers to those two questions
were basically an 18-page dissertation

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.616
on his view of Zambia's
potential role in the world

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.656
and in the international community.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.120
I posted it on the website
so anybody could read it.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.240
Now, Saviour won the global vote,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.840
but he didn't win the Zambian election.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.696
So I found myself wondering,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.656
what am I going to do
with this extraordinary group of people?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.536
I've got some wonderful people here
who won the global vote.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.256
We always get it wrong, by the way.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.496
The one that we elect

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.400
is never the person who's elected
by the domestic electorate.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.560
That may be partly because
we always seem to go for the woman.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.536
But I think it may also be a sign

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.136
that the domestic electorate
is still thinking very nationally.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.296
They're still thinking very inwardly.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.816
They're still asking themselves:
What's in it for me? ...

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.936
instead of what
they should be asking today,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.720
which is, what's in it for we?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.216
But there you go.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.376
So suggestions, please, not right now,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400
but send me an email if you've got an idea

00:06:59.424 --> 00:07:02.700
about what we can do
with this amazing team of glorious losers.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.776
(Laughter)

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.256
We've got Saviour Chishimba,
who I mentioned before.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.656
We've got Halla Tómasdóttir,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.576
who was the runner up
in the Icelandic presidential election.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.296
Many of you may have seen
her amazing talk at TEDWomen

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.536
just a few weeks ago

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.136
where she spoke about the need
for more women to get into politics.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.680
We've got Maria das Neves
from São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.136
We've got Hillary Clinton.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.216
I don't know if she's available.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.440
We've got Jill Stein.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.336
And we covered also the election

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840
for the next Secretary-General
of the United Nations.

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.656
We've got the ex-prime minister
of New Zealand,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.776
who would be a wonderful
member of the team.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.296
So I think maybe those people,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.976
the glorious loser's club,
could travel around the world

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.376
wherever there's an election

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.776
and remind people
of the necessity in our modern age

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.416
of thinking a little bit outwards

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.631
and thinking of
the international consequences.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.336
So what comes next for the global vote?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.136
Well, obviously,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.616
the Donald and Hillary show
is a bit of a difficult one to follow,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.576
but there are some other
really important elections coming up.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.416
In fact, they seem to be multiplying.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.576
There's something going on,
I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.840
And the next row of elections
are all critically important.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.776
In just a few day's time

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.856
we've got the rerun
of the Austrian presidential election,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.656
with the prospect of Norbert Hofer

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.656
becoming what is commonly described

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.160
as the first far-right head of state
in Europe since the Second World War.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.696
Next year we've got Germany,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.936
we've got France,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.096
we've got presidential elections in Iran

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.320
and a dozen others.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.056
It doesn't get less important.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.679
It gets more and more important.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.176
Clearly, the global vote
is not a stand-alone project.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.679
It's not just there on its own.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.016
It has some background.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.056
It's part of a project
which I launched back in 2014,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.640
which I call the Good Country.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.000
The idea of the Good Country
is basically very simple.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.296
It's my simple diagnosis
of what's wrong with the world

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.520
and how we can fix it.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.216
What's wrong with the world
I've already hinted at.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.976
Basically, we face
an enormous and growing number

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.176
of gigantic, existential
global challenges:

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.856
climate change, human rights abuses,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.080
mass migration, terrorism,
economic chaos, weapons proliferation.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.256
All of these problems
which threaten to wipe us out

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.416
are by their very nature
globalized problems.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.840
No individual country has the capability
of tackling them on its own.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.496
And so very obviously

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.136
we have to cooperate
and we have to collaborate as nations

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.018
if we're going to solve these problems.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.920
It's so obvious, and yet we don't.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.760
We don't do it nearly often enough.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.216
Most of the time,
countries still persist in behaving

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.896
as if they were warring, selfish tribes
battling against each other,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.656
much as they have done
since the nation-state was invented

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.256
hundreds of years ago.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.416
And this has got to change.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.776
This is not a change in political systems
or a change in ideology.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.736
This is a change in culture.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760
We, all of us, have to understand

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.656
that thinking inwards is not the solution
to the world's problems.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.656
We have to learn how to cooperate
and collaborate a great deal more

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.080
and compete just a tiny bit less.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.576
Otherwise things
are going to carry on getting bad

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.800
and they're going to get much worse,
much sooner than we anticipate.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.656
This change will only happen

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.416
if we ordinary people

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.256
tell our politicians
that things have changed.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.816
We have to tell them
that the culture has changed.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.416
We have to tell them
that they've got a new mandate.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.336
The old mandate
was very simple and very single:

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.536
if you're in a position
of power or authority,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.176
you're responsible for your own people
and your own tiny slice of territory,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.416
and that's it.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.136
And if in order to do
the best thing for your own people,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.216
you screw over everybody else
on the planet, that's even better.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.976
That's considered to be a bit macho.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.376
Today, I think everybody
in a position of power and responsibility

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.016
has got a dual mandate,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.016
which says if you're in a position
of power and responsibility,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.896
you're responsible for your own people

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.160
and for every single man, woman,
child and animal on the planet.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.656
You're responsible
for your own slice of territory

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.376
and for every single square mile
of the earth's surface

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.776
and the atmosphere above it.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.136
And if you don't like that responsibility,
you should not be in power.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.216
That for me is the rule of the modern age,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.616
and that's the message that we've got
to get across to our politicians,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.936
and show them that that's the way
things are done these days.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.640
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.656
I don't have a problem, actually,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.616
with Donald Trump's credo
of "America first."

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.056
It seems to me that that's
a pretty banal statement

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.256
of what politicians have always done
and probably should always do.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.720
Of course they're elected to represent
the interests of their own people.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.456
But what I find so boring
and so old-fashioned

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.216
and so unimaginative
about his take on that

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.760
is that America first
means everyone else last,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.456
that making America great again
means making everybody else small again,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.680
and it's just not true.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.536
In my job as a policy advisor
over the last 20 years or so,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.176
I've seen so many hundreds
of examples of policies

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.736
that harmonize the international
and the domestic needs,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.736
and they make better policy.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.336
I'm not asking nations
to be altruistic or self-sacrificing.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.696
That would be ridiculous.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.120
No nation would ever do that.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.656
I'm asking them to wake up and understand
that we need a new form of governance,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.880
which is possible

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.456
and which harmonizes those two needs,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.520
those good for our own people
and those good for everybody else.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.736
Since the US election and since Brexit

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.136
it's become more and more obvious to me

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.776
that those old distinctions
of left wing and right wing

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.096
no longer make sense.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.760
They really don't fit the pattern.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.056
What does seem to matter today

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.696
is very simple,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.896
whether your view of the world is

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.616
that you take comfort
from looking inwards and backwards,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.360
or whether, like me, you find hope
in looking forwards and outwards.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.736
That's the new politics.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.400
That's the new division that is
splitting the world right down the middle.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.696
Now, that may sound judgmental,
but it's not meant to be.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.656
I don't at all misunderstand

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.800
why so many people find their comfort
in looking inwards and backwards.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.056
When times are difficult,
when you're short of money,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.176
when you're feeling
insecure and vulnerable,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.696
it's almost a natural
human tendency to turn inwards,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.736
to think of your own needs

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.856
and to discard everybody else's,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.616
and perhaps to start to imagine
that the past was somehow better

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.040
than the present or the future
could ever be.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.176
But I happen to believe
that that's a dead end.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.456
History shows us that it's a dead end.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.616
When people turn inwards
and turn backwards,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.416
human progress becomes reversed

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.000
and things get worse for everybody
very quickly indeed.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.136
If you're like me

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.856
and you believe in forwards and outwards,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.576
and you believe that the best thing
about humanity is its diversity,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.376
and the best thing about globalization

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.696
is the way that it stirs up
that diversity, that cultural mixture

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.736
to make something more creative,
more exciting, more productive

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.696
than there's ever been before
in human history,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.240
then, my friends,
we've got a job on our hands,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.056
because the inwards and backwards brigade

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.616
are uniting as never before,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.576
and that creed of inwards and backwards,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.160
that fear, that anxiety,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.856
playing on the simplest instincts,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.416
is sweeping across the world.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.376
Those of us who believe,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.136
as I believe, in forwards and outwards,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.040
we have to get ourselves organized,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.720
because time is running out
very, very quickly.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.456
Thank you.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.800
(Applause)
