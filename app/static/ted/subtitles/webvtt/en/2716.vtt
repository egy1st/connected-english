00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:05.580
Chris Anderson: Welcome
to this next edition of TED Dialogues.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.670
We're trying to do
some bridging here today.

00:00:08.694 --> 00:00:11.614
You know, the American dream
has inspired millions of people

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:14.398
around the world for many years.

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:20.654
Today, I think, you can say
that America is divided,

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:22.339
perhaps more than ever,

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.418
and the divisions seem
to be getting worse.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.283
It's actually really hard
for people on different sides

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:29.761
to even have a conversation.

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.097
People almost feel...

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.767
disgusted with each other.

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.872
Some families can't even speak
to each other right now.

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.229
Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.913
to try to have a different kind
of conversation,

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:51.178
to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:54.630
And I have two people with us
to help us do that.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.893
They're not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.681
This is not like cable news.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:05.198
This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life

00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:07.509
in the political center
or right of the center.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.497
They've immersed themselves
in conservative worldviews, if you like.

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:13.644
They know that space very well.

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:15.377
And we're going to explore together

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.422
how to think about
what is happening right now,

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:21.591
and whether we can find new ways to bridge

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.832
and just to have wiser,
more connected conversations.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:27.959
With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:33.273
who has spent a decade
working at Fox News,

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:37.775
hosting "Fox and Friends"
and then "The Real Story,"

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.572
before taking a courageous stance
in filing sexual harassment claims

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:44.812
against Roger Ailes,

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:48.201
which eventually led
to his departure from Fox News.

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:51.465
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.403
of many of [The New York Times's]
left-leaning readers

00:01:54.427 --> 00:01:57.315
because of his conservative views,

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:00.273
and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:03.564
because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:06.724
Yet, his columns are usually

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:11.144
the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.408
because they're brilliant,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.731
because they bring psychology
and social science

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:18.208
to providing understanding
for what's going on.

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:21.505
So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.687
Come and join me.

00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.424
(Applause)

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:28.814
So, Gretchen.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.529
Sixty-three million Americans
voted for Donald Trump.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.219
Why did they do this?

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:39.763
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:43.062
I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.894
It didn't just happen overnight.

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:47.829
"Anger" would be the first word
that I would think of --

00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:52.116
anger with nothing
being done in Washington,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.204
anger about not being heard.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.371
I think there was a huge swath
of the population

00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:01.144
that feels like Washington
never listens to them,

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:05.402
you know, a good part of the middle
of America, not just the coasts,

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:09.635
and he was somebody they felt
was listening to their concerns.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:14.382
So I think those two issues
would be the main reason.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:16.456
I have to throw in there also celebrity.

00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:23.058
I think that had a huge impact
on Donald Trump becoming president.

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:25.712
CA: Was the anger justified?

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.624
David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.

00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:31.722
In 2015 and early 2016,
I wrote about 30 columns

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:33.097
with the following theme:

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.108
don't worry, Donald Trump will never
be the Republican nominee.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.292
(Laughter)

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.514
And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:42.722
I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:45.616
and I found a lot of economic dislocation.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.210
I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:52.702
She said, "The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don't have to speak,

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:54.998
and that's good,
because we're not word people."

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:57.004
That phrase rung in my head: word people.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.804
A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:02.955
but if you're not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.616
and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.249
because those jobs are done away.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:09.813
A lot of social injury.

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:13.134
You used to be able to say,
"I'm not the richest person in the world,

00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:14.376
I'm not the most famous,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.705
but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that."

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.283
And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,

00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:22.465
you feel invisible.

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.801
And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,

00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:29.680
and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:33.274
which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you're a success,

00:04:33.298 --> 00:04:35.386
and if you don't fit in that formula,

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.167
you feel like you're not respected.

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:39.009
And so that accumulation of things --

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:41.225
and when I talked to Trump
voters and still do,

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.934
I found most of them completely
realistic about his failings,

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.596
but they said, this is my shot.

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:50.580
GC: And yet I predicted
that he would be the nominee,

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:52.788
because I've known him for 27 years.

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:54.602
He's a master marketer,

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:56.629
and one of the things
he did extremely well

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:58.847
that President Obama also did
extremely well,

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.909
was simplifying the message,

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.721
simplifying down to phrases

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:05.794
and to a populist message.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:08.543
Even if he can't achieve it,
it sounded good.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.805
And many people latched on
to that simplicity again.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.774
It's something they could grasp onto:

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:18.195
"I get that. I want that.
That sounds fantastic."

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.875
And I remember when he used to come
on my show originally,

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.300
before "The Apprentice"
was even "The Apprentice,"

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.503
and he'd say it was the number
one show on TV.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:28.284
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not."

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.218
And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen."

00:05:30.242 --> 00:05:32.126
And I would say, "No it's not."

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.685
But people at home would see that,
and they'd be like,

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.285
"Wow, I should be watching
the number one show on TV."

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.262
And -- lo and behold -- it became
the number one show on TV.

00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:43.588
So he had this, I've seen
this ability in him

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:45.810
to be the master marketer.

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:48.418
CA: It's puzzling
to a lot of people on the left

00:05:48.442 --> 00:05:51.701
that so many women voted for him,

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.262
despite some of his comments.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.001
GC: I wrote a column
about this for Time Motto,

00:05:56.025 --> 00:06:00.317
saying that I really believe
that lot of people put on blinders,

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:04.183
and maybe for the first time,

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.979
some people decided
that policies they believed in

00:06:07.003 --> 00:06:09.551
and being heard
and not being invisible anymore

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:11.526
was more important to them

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.126
than the way in which he had acted
or acts as a human.

00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:17.959
And so human dignity --

00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:21.451
whether it would be the dust-up
about the disabled reporter,

00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:24.015
or what happened
in that audiotape with Billy Bush

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.244
and the way in which he spoke
about women --

00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:29.248
they put that aside

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:31.893
and pretended as if
they hadn't seen that or heard that,

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:35.953
because to them,
policies were more important.

00:06:35.977 --> 00:06:38.788
CA: Right, so just because
someone voted for Trump,

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:42.539
it's not blind adherence to everything
that he's said or stood for.

00:06:42.563 --> 00:06:45.385
GC: No. I heard a lot of people
that would say to me,

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.472
"Wow, I just wish he would shut up
before the election.

00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:51.198
If he would just stay quiet,
he'd get elected."

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:55.020
CA: And so, maybe for people on the left
there's a trap there,

00:06:55.044 --> 00:07:00.622
to sort of despise
or just be baffled by the support,

00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:03.730
assuming that it's for some
of the unattractive features.

00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:06.299
Actually, maybe they're supporting
him despite those,

00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:08.109
because they see something exciting.

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:09.475
They see a man of action.

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:14.557
They see the choking hold of government
being thrown off in some way

00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:15.920
and they're excited by that.

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:19.320
GC: But don't forget we saw that
on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.

00:07:19.344 --> 00:07:23.298
So this is one of the commonalities
that I think we can talk about today,

00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:26.365
"The Year of the Outsider,"
David -- right?

00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:30.268
And even though Bernie Sanders
has been in Congress for a long time,

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.505
he was deemed an outsider this time.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.871
And so there was anger
on the left as well,

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:38.346
and so many people were in favor
of Bernie Sanders.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:42.742
So I see it as a commonality.

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:45.345
People who like Trump,
people who like Bernie Sanders,

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:49.172
they were liking different policies,
but the underpinning was anger.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:53.766
CA: David, there's often
this narrative, then,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.981
that the sole explanation
for Trump's victory and his rise

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:03.957
is his tapping into anger
in a very visceral way.

00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.639
But you've written a bit about
that it's actually more than that,

00:08:08.663 --> 00:08:11.861
that there's a worldview
that's being worked on here.

00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:13.158
Could you talk about that?

00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:15.737
DB: I would say he understood what,
frankly, I didn't,

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.617
which is what debate we were having.

00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:20.074
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:23.002
and it was the big government
versus small government debate.

00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.215
It was Barry Goldwater
versus George McGovern,

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:29.344
and that was the debate
we had been having for a generation.

00:08:29.368 --> 00:08:33.533
It was: Democrats wanted to use
government to enhance equality,

00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:36.305
Republicans wanted to limit government
to enhance freedom.

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:37.512
That was the debate.

00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:40.346
He understood what I think
the two major parties did not,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.314
which was that's not the debate anymore.

00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:44.667
The debate is now open versus closed.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.957
On one side are those who have
the tailwinds of globalization

00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:50.214
and the meritocracy blowing at their back,

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.637
and they tend to favor open trade,

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:54.646
open borders, open social mores,

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.632
because there are so many opportunities.

00:08:56.656 --> 00:09:00.112
On the other side are those
who feel the headwinds of globalization

00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:02.528
and the meritocracy
just blasting in their faces,

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:06.483
and they favor closed trade,
closed borders, closed social mores,

00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:08.598
because they just want some security.

00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:10.766
And so he was right
on that fundamental issue,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.442
and people were willing
to overlook a lot to get there.

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:15.573
And so he felt that sense of security.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:19.926
We're speaking the morning after
Trump's joint session speech.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.776
There are three traditional
groups in the Republican Party.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.578
There are the foreign policies hawks

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:26.657
who believe in America
as global policeman.

00:09:26.681 --> 00:09:28.534
Trump totally repudiated that view.

00:09:28.558 --> 00:09:30.604
Second, there was the social conservatives

00:09:30.628 --> 00:09:32.335
who believed in religious liberty,

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:34.272
pro-life,

00:09:34.296 --> 00:09:36.765
prayer in schools.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.355
He totally ignored that.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:42.814
There was not a single mention
of a single social conservative issue.

00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:44.657
And then there were the fiscal hawks,

00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:47.799
the people who wanted to cut down
on the national debt, Tea Party,

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:49.129
cut the size of government.

00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:51.008
He's expanding the size of government!

00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:54.714
Here's a man who has single-handedly
revolutionized a major American party

00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:57.711
because he understood
where the debate was headed

00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:59.082
before other people.

00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:01.121
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:03.172
and give him substance to his impulses.

00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:05.976
CA: And so take that a bit further,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.755
and maybe expand a bit more
on your insights

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:12.042
into Steve Bannon's worldview.

00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:14.798
Because he's sometimes tarred
in very simple terms

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:21.433
as this dangerous, racist,
xenophobic, anger-sparking person.

00:10:21.457 --> 00:10:25.973
There's more to the story;
that is perhaps an unfair simplification.

00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:27.433
DB: I think that part is true,

00:10:27.457 --> 00:10:29.927
but there's another part
that's probably true, too.

00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:32.111
He's part of a global movement.

00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:34.820
It's like being around Marxists in 1917.

00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:39.040
There's him here, there's the UKIP party,
there's the National Front in France,

00:10:39.064 --> 00:10:42.109
there's Putin, there's a Turkish version,
a Philippine version.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.604
So we have to recognize that this
is a global intellectual movement.

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:46.843
And it believes

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:52.124
that wisdom and virtue is not held
in individual conversation and civility

00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:55.550
the way a lot of us
in the enlightenment side of the world do.

00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:59.152
It's held in -- the German word
is the "volk" -- in the people,

00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:02.036
in the common, instinctive wisdom
of the plain people.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.678
And the essential virtue of that people
is always being threatened by outsiders.

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.385
And he's got a strategy
for how to get there.

00:11:10.409 --> 00:11:14.437
He's got a series of policies
to bring the people up

00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:16.787
and repudiate the outsiders,

00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:21.580
whether those outsiders
are Islam, Mexicans, the media,

00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:23.474
the coastal elites...

00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:26.811
And there's a whole worldview there;
it's a very coherent worldview.

00:11:26.835 --> 00:11:28.734
I sort of have more respect for him.

00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:32.009
I loathe what he stands for
and I think he's wrong on the substance,

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:34.740
but it's interesting to see someone
with a set of ideas

00:11:34.764 --> 00:11:36.737
find a vehicle, Donald Trump,

00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:39.879
and then try to take control
of the White House

00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:42.005
in order to advance his viewpoint.

00:11:42.029 --> 00:11:46.855
CA: So it's almost become, like,
that the core question of our time now is:

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:51.900
Can you be patriotic
but also have a global mindset?

00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:56.195
Are these two things
implacably opposed to each other?

00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:59.680
I mean, a lot of conservatives

00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.151
and, to the extent
that it's a different category,

00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:03.456
a lot of Trump supporters,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.406
are infuriated by the coastal elites
and the globalists

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.416
because they see them
as, sort of, not cheering for America,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.102
not embracing fully American values.

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:17.678
I mean, have you seen that
in your conversations with people,

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:19.606
in your understanding of their mindset?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.831
GC: I do think that there's
a huge difference between --

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:24.837
I hate to put people in categories, but,

00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:28.822
Middle America versus
people who live on the coasts.

00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:30.912
It's an entirely different existence.

00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:34.602
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have
an understanding of Middle America,

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:35.982
and I've never forgotten it.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.513
And maybe that's why I have
an understanding of what happened here,

00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:44.361
because those people often feel
like nobody's listening to them,

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:48.873
and that we're only concentrating
on California and New York.

00:12:48.897 --> 00:12:53.421
And so I think that was a huge reason
why Trump was elected.

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:57.533
I mean, these people felt like
they were being heard.

00:12:57.557 --> 00:13:01.707
Whether or not patriotism falls into that,

00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:02.900
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:04.095
I do know one thing:

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:08.174
a lot of things Trump talked about
last night are not conservative things.

00:13:08.198 --> 00:13:10.675
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up
and given that speech,

00:13:10.699 --> 00:13:13.056
not one Republican would have
stood up to applaud.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.707
I mean, he's talking about spending
a trillion dollars on infrastructure.

00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:18.569
That is not a conservative viewpoint.

00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:21.572
He talked about government-mandated
maternity leave.

00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:25.330
A lot of women may love that;
it's not a conservative viewpoint.

00:13:25.354 --> 00:13:26.505
So it's fascinating

00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:30.229
that people who loved what his message
was during the campaign,

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.855
I'm not sure -- how do you
think they'll react to that?

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:35.065
DB: I should say I grew up
in Lower Manhattan,

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:37.820
in the triangle between ABC Carpets,
the Strand Bookstore

00:13:37.844 --> 00:13:39.158
and The Odeon restaurant.

00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:40.813
(Laughter)

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.691
GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!

00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:43.948
(Laughter)

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:49.622
CA: You are a card-carrying member
of the coastal elite, my man.

00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:51.898
But what did you make
of the speech last night?

00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:55.369
It seemed to be a move
to a more moderate position,

00:13:55.393 --> 00:13:56.544
on the face of it.

00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:58.595
DB: Yeah, I thought it
was his best speech,

00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:00.657
and it took away the freakishness of him.

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:02.537
I do think he's a moral freak,

00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:05.363
and I think he'll be undone by that fact,

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:08.166
the fact that he just doesn't know
anything about anything

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.443
and is uncurious about it.

00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:10.560
(Laughter)

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.749
But if you take away these minor flaws,

00:14:12.773 --> 00:14:14.845
I think we got to see him at his best,

00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:17.987
and it was revealing for me
to see him at his best,

00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:22.528
because to me, it exposed a central
contradiction that he's got to confront,

00:14:22.552 --> 00:14:25.556
that a lot of what he's doing
is offering security.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.378
So, "I'm ordering closed borders,

00:14:27.402 --> 00:14:30.265
I'm going to secure the world
for you, for my people."

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:33.337
But then if you actually look
at a lot of his economic policies,

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:37.142
like health care reform, which is about
private health care accounts,

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:40.031
that's not security, that's risk.

00:14:40.055 --> 00:14:43.751
Educational vouchers: that's risk.
Deregulation: that's risk.

00:14:43.775 --> 00:14:47.752
There's really a contradiction
between the security of the mindset

00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:50.560
and a lot of the policies,
which are very risk-oriented.

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:54.085
And what I would say, especially
having spent this year,

00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:57.974
the people in rural Minnesota,
in New Mexico --

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.063
they've got enough risk in their lives.

00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:03.402
And so they're going to say,
"No thank you."

00:15:03.426 --> 00:15:07.194
And I think his health care repeal
will fail for that reason.

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:10.163
CA: But despite the criticisms
you just made of him,

00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:14.399
it does at least seem that he's listening

00:15:14.423 --> 00:15:16.597
to a surprisingly wide range of voices;

00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:19.392
it's not like everyone
is coming from the same place.

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:24.676
And maybe that leads to a certain
amount of chaos and confusion, but --

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.922
GC: I actually don't think he's listening
to a wide range of voices.

00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:29.976
I think he's listening to very few people.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.803
That's just my impression of it.

00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:34.282
I believe that some of the things
he said last night

00:15:34.306 --> 00:15:36.329
had Ivanka all over them.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:40.267
So I believe he was listening
to her before that speech.

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:44.514
And he was Teleprompter Trump
last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.

00:15:44.538 --> 00:15:46.663
And that's why, before we came out here,

00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:50.898
I said, "We better check Twitter
to see if anything's changed."

00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:53.111
And also I think you have to keep in mind

00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:56.318
that because he's such a unique character,

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:59.187
what was the bar that we
were expecting last night?

00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.067
Was it here or here or here?

00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.853
And so he comes out
and gives a looking political speech,

00:16:05.877 --> 00:16:09.265
and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it."

00:16:09.289 --> 00:16:11.311
It just depends
on which direction he goes.

00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:13.700
DB: Yeah, and we're trying
to build bridges here,

00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.761
and especially for an audience
that may have contempt for Trump,

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:19.034
it's important to say,
no, this is a real thing.

00:16:19.058 --> 00:16:22.912
But as I try my best to go an hour
showing respect for him,

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:24.927
my thyroid is surging,

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.323
because I think the oddities
of his character

00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.828
really are condemnatory
and are going to doom him.

00:16:30.852 --> 00:16:36.310
CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.

00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:38.708
People would you describe you
as right of center,

00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:42.965
and yet here you are
with this visceral reaction against him

00:16:42.989 --> 00:16:44.615
and some of what he stands for.

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:48.266
I mean, I'm -- how do you have
a conversation?

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.219
The people who support him,
on evidence so far,

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.435
are probably pretty excited.

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:58.617
He's certainly shown real engagement

00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:00.757
in a lot of what he promised to do,

00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:04.882
and there is a strong desire
to change the system radically.

00:17:04.906 --> 00:17:09.036
People hate what government has become
and how it's left them out.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.842
GC: I totally agree with that,

00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:14.533
but I think that when he was proposing
a huge government program last night

00:17:14.557 --> 00:17:18.625
that we used to call the bad s-word,
"stimulus," I find it completely ironic.

00:17:18.649 --> 00:17:20.657
To spend a trillion dollars
on something --

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:22.456
that is not a conservative viewpoint.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.966
Then again, I don't really believe
he's a Republican.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.011
DB: And I would say, as someone
who identifies as conservative:

00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:29.198
first of all,

00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:32.260
to be conservative is to believe
in the limitations of politics.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:35.402
Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the things
that human hearts endure,

00:17:35.426 --> 00:17:37.873
how few are those that kings
can cause and cure."

00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:39.542
Politics is a limited realm;

00:17:39.566 --> 00:17:42.603
what matters most
is the moral nature of the society.

00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:44.796
And so I have to think
character comes first,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.193
and a man who doesn't pass
the character threshold

00:17:47.217 --> 00:17:48.557
cannot be a good president.

00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:51.246
Second, I'm the kind
of conservative who --

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.957
I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,

00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:56.311
who was a Latino hip-hop star
from the heights --

00:17:56.335 --> 00:18:00.410
(Laughter)

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:05.805
but his definition of America
was very future-oriented.

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:08.185
He was a poor boy from the islands

00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:12.522
who had this rapid and amazing
rise to success,

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:15.499
and he wanted government to give
poor boys and girls like him

00:18:15.523 --> 00:18:16.677
a chance to succeed,

00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:19.922
using limited but energetic government
to create social mobility.

00:18:19.946 --> 00:18:23.530
For him and for Lincoln
and for Teddy Roosevelt,

00:18:23.554 --> 00:18:25.889
the idea of America
was the idea of the future.

00:18:25.913 --> 00:18:28.804
We may have division and racism
and slavery in our past,

00:18:28.828 --> 00:18:30.720
but we have a common future.

00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:34.942
The definition of America that Steve
Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.

00:18:34.966 --> 00:18:36.913
It's nostalgic; it's for the past.

00:18:36.937 --> 00:18:39.417
And that is not traditionally
the American identity.

00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:41.901
That's traditionally, frankly,
the Russian identity.

00:18:41.925 --> 00:18:43.407
That's how they define virtue.

00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:46.284
And so I think it is a fundamental
and foundational betrayal

00:18:46.308 --> 00:18:48.237
of what conservatism used to stand for.

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:50.609
CA: Well, I'd like actually
like to hear from you,

00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:53.655
and if we see some comments coming in
from some of you, we'll --

00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:55.151
oh, well here's one right now.

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:58.315
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried
to convince progressive friends

00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:01.231
that they need to understand
what motivates Trump supporters,

00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:03.672
yet many of them have given up
trying to understand

00:19:03.696 --> 00:19:06.840
in the face of what they perceive
as lies, selfishness and hatred.

00:19:06.864 --> 00:19:10.049
How would you reach out to such people,
the Tea Party of the left,

00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:11.886
to try to bridge this divide?

00:19:13.078 --> 00:19:16.156
GC: I actually think
there are commonalities in anger,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.618
as I expressed earlier.

00:19:17.642 --> 00:19:22.072
So I think you can come to the table,
both being passionate about something.

00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:23.626
So at least you care.

00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:28.142
And I would like to believe --
the c-word has also become

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.742
a horrible word -- "compromise," right?

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:32.837
So you have the far left
and the far right,

00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.244
and compromise -- forget it.

00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:36.549
Those groups don't want
to even think about it.

00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:39.663
But you have a huge swath
of voters, myself included,

00:19:39.687 --> 00:19:41.415
who are registered independents,

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:43.407
like 40 percent of us, right?

00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:47.732
So there is a huge faction of America
that wants to see change

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:50.390
and wants to see people come together.

00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:52.180
It's just that we have to figure out

00:19:52.204 --> 00:19:53.615
how to do that.

00:19:53.639 --> 00:19:55.757
CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,

00:19:55.781 --> 00:19:59.001
because we're having these TED Dialogues,
we're trying to bridge.

00:19:59.025 --> 00:20:02.701
There's a lot of people out there,
right now, perhaps especially on the left,

00:20:02.725 --> 00:20:04.516
who think this is a terrible idea,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:10.479
that actually, the only moral response
to the great tyranny

00:20:10.503 --> 00:20:14.514
that may be about to emerge in America

00:20:14.538 --> 00:20:18.170
is to resist it at every stage,
is to fight it tooth and nail,

00:20:18.194 --> 00:20:20.075
it's a mistake to try and do this.

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:21.281
Just fight!

00:20:22.001 --> 00:20:24.346
Is there a case for that?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.950
DB: It depends what "fight" means.
If it means literal fighting, then no.

00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:31.098
If it means marching, well maybe
marching to raise consciousness,

00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:32.387
that seems fine.

00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:36.542
But if you want change in this country,
we do it through parties and politics.

00:20:36.566 --> 00:20:41.343
We organize parties, and those parties
are big, diverse, messy coalitions,

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:42.985
and we engage in politics,

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:45.337
and politics is always
morally unsatisfying

00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:47.838
because it's always
a bunch of compromises.

00:20:47.862 --> 00:20:51.644
But politics is essentially
a competition between partial truths.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.303
The Trump people have a piece
of the truth in America.

00:20:54.327 --> 00:20:57.440
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer
to the right question,

00:20:57.464 --> 00:20:59.475
but they have some truth,

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:03.648
and it's truth found in the epidemic
of opiates around the country,

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:06.664
it's truth found in
the spread of loneliness,

00:21:06.688 --> 00:21:09.647
it's the truth found in people
whose lives are inverted.

00:21:09.671 --> 00:21:12.093
They peaked professionally at age 30,

00:21:12.117 --> 00:21:14.142
and it's all been downhill since.

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.680
And so, understanding that
doesn't take fighting,

00:21:16.704 --> 00:21:18.655
it takes conversation and then asking,

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.689
"What are we going to replace Trump with?"

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:23.380
GC: But you saw fighting last night,
even at the speech,

00:21:23.404 --> 00:21:26.272
because you saw the Democratic women
who came and wore white

00:21:26.296 --> 00:21:28.004
to honor the suffragette movement.

00:21:28.028 --> 00:21:30.055
I remember back during the campaign

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.568
where some Trump supporters wanted
to actually get rid of the amendment

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.306
that allowed us to vote as women.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.498
It was like, what?

00:21:37.522 --> 00:21:39.848
So I don't know if
that's the right way to fight.

00:21:39.872 --> 00:21:42.680
It was interesting,
because I was looking in the audience,

00:21:42.704 --> 00:21:45.259
trying to see Democratic women
who didn't wear white.

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:46.833
So there's a lot going on there,

00:21:46.857 --> 00:21:53.492
and there's a lot of ways to fight
that are not necessarily doing that.

00:21:53.516 --> 00:21:55.990
CA: I mean, one of the key
questions, to me, is:

00:21:56.014 --> 00:22:01.663
The people who voted for Trump
but, if you like, are more in the center,

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:05.269
like they're possibly
amenable to persuasion --

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:11.084
are they more likely to be persuaded
by seeing a passionate uprising

00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:14.621
of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!"

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:18.559
or will that actually piss them off
and push them away?

00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.231
DB: How are any of us persuaded?

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:23.582
Am I going to persuade you by saying,
"Well, you're kind of a bigot,

00:22:23.606 --> 00:22:26.547
you're supporting bigotry,
you're supporting sexism.

00:22:26.571 --> 00:22:31.199
You're a primitive, fascistic rise
from some authoritarian past"?

00:22:31.223 --> 00:22:33.908
That's probably not going to be
too persuasive to you.

00:22:33.932 --> 00:22:36.573
And so the way any of us
are persuaded is by:

00:22:36.597 --> 00:22:40.939
a) some basic show of respect
for the point of view, and saying,

00:22:40.963 --> 00:22:44.282
"I think this guy is not going
to get you where you need to go."

00:22:44.306 --> 00:22:47.686
And there are two phrases
you've heard over and over again,

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.203
wherever you go in the country.

00:22:49.227 --> 00:22:51.118
One, the phrase "flyover country."

00:22:51.142 --> 00:22:52.990
And that's been heard for years,

00:22:53.014 --> 00:22:56.710
but I would say this year,
I heard it almost on an hourly basis,

00:22:56.734 --> 00:22:58.245
a sense of feeling invisible.

00:22:58.269 --> 00:23:02.027
And then the sense a sense of the phrase
"political correctness."

00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:06.130
Just that rebellion: "They're not even
letting us say what we think."

00:23:06.154 --> 00:23:07.479
And I teach at Yale.

00:23:07.503 --> 00:23:11.772
The narrowing of debate is real.

00:23:12.449 --> 00:23:15.653
CA: So you would say this is a trap
that liberals have fallen into

00:23:15.677 --> 00:23:18.773
by celebrating causes
they really believe in,

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:22.759
often expressed through the language
of "political correctness."

00:23:22.783 --> 00:23:27.118
They have done damage.
They have pushed people away.

00:23:27.142 --> 00:23:29.290
DB: I would say
a lot of the argument, though,

00:23:29.314 --> 00:23:31.675
with "descent to fascism,"
"authoritarianism" --

00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:33.888
that just feels over-the-top to people.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.695
And listen, I've written
eight million anti-Trump columns,

00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:39.389
but it is a problem, especially
for the coastal media,

00:23:39.413 --> 00:23:43.586
that every time he does something
slightly wrong, we go to 11,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.796
and we're at 11 every day.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.660
And it just strains
credibility at some point.

00:23:48.684 --> 00:23:51.410
CA: Crying wolf a little too loud
and a little too early.

00:23:51.434 --> 00:23:54.301
But there may be a time
when we really do have to cry wolf.

00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:56.897
GC: But see -- one of the most
important things to me

00:23:56.921 --> 00:23:59.542
is how the conservative media
handles Trump.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:05.012
Will they call him out
when things are not true,

00:24:05.036 --> 00:24:07.219
or will they just go along with it?

00:24:07.243 --> 00:24:11.272
To me, that is what is essential
in this entire discussion,

00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:15.880
because when you have
followers of somebody

00:24:15.904 --> 00:24:19.536
who don't really care
if he tells the truth or not,

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.845
that can be very dangerous.

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:26.155
So to me, it's: How is the conservative
media going to respond to it?

00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:28.673
I mean, you've been calling them out.

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:33.082
But how will other forms
of conservative media deal with that

00:24:33.106 --> 00:24:34.264
as we move forward?

00:24:34.288 --> 00:24:35.684
DB: It's all shifted, though.

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.346
The conservative media used to be Fox
or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.374
They're no longer the conservative media.

00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:44.229
Now there's another whole set
of institutions further right,

00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:49.850
which is Breitbart and Infowars,
Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,

00:24:49.874 --> 00:24:53.675
and so they're the ones who are now
his base, not even so much Fox.

00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:57.786
CA: My last question for the time being
is just on this question of the truth.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.689
I mean, it's one of the scariest
things to people right now,

00:25:00.713 --> 00:25:04.396
that there is no agreement,
nationally, on what is true.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.210
I've never seen anything like it,

00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:09.571
where facts are so massively disputed.

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:13.146
Your whole newspaper, sir,
is delivering fake news every day.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.678
DB: And failing.

00:25:14.702 --> 00:25:15.790
(Laughter)

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:17.770
CA: And failing. My commiserations.

00:25:17.794 --> 00:25:24.084
But is there any path

00:25:24.108 --> 00:25:27.918
whereby we can start to get
some kind of consensus,

00:25:27.942 --> 00:25:30.802
to believe the same things?

00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:34.394
Can online communities play a role here?

00:25:34.418 --> 00:25:35.587
How do we fix this?

00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:37.649
GC: See, I understand how that happened.

00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:39.872
That's another groundswell kind of emotion

00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:41.911
that was going on in the middle of America

00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:43.168
and not being heard,

00:25:43.192 --> 00:25:46.223
in thinking that the mainstream
media was biased.

00:25:46.247 --> 00:25:50.313
There's a difference, though,
between being biased and being fake.

00:25:50.337 --> 00:25:53.910
To me, that is a very important
distinction in this conversation.

00:25:53.934 --> 00:25:58.432
So let's just say that there was some bias
in the mainstream media.

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:01.389
OK. So there are ways
to try and mend that.

00:26:01.413 --> 00:26:05.488
But what Trump's doing
is nuclearizing that and saying,

00:26:05.512 --> 00:26:08.050
"Look, we're just going to call
all of that fake."

00:26:08.074 --> 00:26:09.620
That's where it gets dangerous.

00:26:09.644 --> 00:26:12.505
CA: Do you think enough of his supporters

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:16.774
have a greater loyalty
to the truth than to any ...

00:26:16.798 --> 00:26:21.437
Like, the principle
of not supporting something

00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:23.459
that is demonstrably not true

00:26:23.483 --> 00:26:26.444
actually matters, so there will be
a correction at some point?

00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:28.758
DB: I think the truth
eventually comes out.

00:26:28.782 --> 00:26:31.938
So for example, Donald Trump
has based a lot of his economic policy

00:26:31.962 --> 00:26:34.966
on this supposition that Americans
have lost manufacturing jobs

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.032
because they've been stolen
by the Chinese.

00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:39.982
That is maybe 13 percent
of the jobs that left.

00:26:40.006 --> 00:26:43.588
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs
were replaced by technology.

00:26:43.612 --> 00:26:45.390
That is just the truth.

00:26:45.414 --> 00:26:48.076
And so as a result, when he says,

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.067
"I'm going to close TPP
and all the jobs will come roaring back,"

00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:53.652
they will not come roaring back.

00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:56.760
So that is an actual fact, in my belief.

00:26:56.784 --> 00:26:57.942
And --

00:26:57.966 --> 00:26:59.265
(Laughter)

00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:02.005
GC: But I'm saying what
his supporters think is the truth,

00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:04.164
no matter how many times
you might say that,

00:27:04.188 --> 00:27:05.394
they still believe him.

00:27:05.418 --> 00:27:09.177
DB: But eventually either jobs
will come back or they will not come back,

00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:12.296
and at that point, either something
will work or it doesn't work,

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.115
and it doesn't work or not work
because of great marketing,

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:17.684
it works because it actually
addresses a real problem

00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:20.194
and so I happen to think
the truth will out.

00:27:20.218 --> 00:27:24.161
CA: If you've got a question,
please raise your hand here.

00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.805
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.

00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:29.823
My name's Yael Eisenstat.

00:27:29.847 --> 00:27:31.458
I hear a lot of this talk

00:27:31.482 --> 00:27:34.161
about how we all need to start
talking to each other more

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:35.861
and understanding each other more,

00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:39.425
and I've even written about this,
published on this subject as well,

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:44.559
but now today I keep hearing liberals --
yes, I live in New York,

00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:46.306
I can be considered a liberal --

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.029
we sit here and self-analyze:

00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:50.362
What did we do to not understand
the Rust Belt?

00:27:50.386 --> 00:27:53.236
Or: What can we do to understand
Middle America better?

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.708
And what I'd like to know:

00:27:54.732 --> 00:27:58.658
Have you seen any attempts
or conversations from Middle America

00:27:58.682 --> 00:28:01.899
of what can I do to understand
the so-called coastal elites better?

00:28:01.923 --> 00:28:05.926
Because I'm just offended
as being put in a box as a coastal elite

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.174
as someone in Middle America is
as being considered a flyover state

00:28:09.198 --> 00:28:10.675
and not listened to.

00:28:10.699 --> 00:28:13.442
CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook
cheering as you --

00:28:13.466 --> 00:28:14.566
(Laughter)

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.140
DB: I would say -- and this is someone
who has been conservative

00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:19.330
all my adult life --

00:28:19.354 --> 00:28:21.121
when you grow up conservative,

00:28:21.145 --> 00:28:23.100
you learn to speak both languages.

00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:26.210
Because if I'm going to listen to music,

00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:28.352
I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:33.057
So a lot of my favorite rock bands
are all on the left.

00:28:33.081 --> 00:28:34.619
If I'm going to go to a school,

00:28:34.643 --> 00:28:37.396
I'm going probably to school
where the culture is liberal.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.027
If I'm going to watch a sitcom

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:41.614
or a late-night comedy show,
it's going to be liberal.

00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:44.821
If I'm going to read a good newspaper,
it'll be the New York Times.

00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:47.111
As a result, you learn
to speak both languages.

00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:50.019
And that actually, at least
for a number of years,

00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:52.861
when I started at National Review
with William F. Buckley,

00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:54.365
it made us sharper,

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:58.016
because we were used to arguing
against people every day.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.349
The problem now that's happened
is you have ghettoization on the right

00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:03.734
and you can live entirely in rightworld,

00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:07.229
so as a result, the quality of argument
on the right has diminished,

00:29:07.253 --> 00:29:09.796
because you're not in the other side

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.073
all the time.

00:29:11.097 --> 00:29:16.049
But I do think if you're living
in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,

00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:18.408
the coastal elites
make themselves aware to you,

00:29:18.432 --> 00:29:20.118
so you know that language as well,

00:29:20.142 --> 00:29:21.570
but it's not the reverse.

00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:25.825
CA: But what does Middle America
not get about coastal elites?

00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:28.889
So the critique is,

00:29:28.913 --> 00:29:31.675
you are not dealing
with the real problems.

00:29:31.699 --> 00:29:38.160
There's a feeling of a snobbishness,
an elitism that is very off-putting.

00:29:38.184 --> 00:29:39.352
What are they missing?

00:29:39.376 --> 00:29:42.879
If you could plant one piece of truth

00:29:42.903 --> 00:29:48.093
from the mindset of someone
in this room, for example,

00:29:48.117 --> 00:29:50.845
what would you say to them?

00:29:50.869 --> 00:29:52.784
DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.

00:29:52.808 --> 00:29:54.411
(Laughter)

00:29:54.435 --> 00:29:56.785
No, I reject the category.

00:29:56.809 --> 00:30:00.293
The problem with populism
is the same problem with elitism.

00:30:00.317 --> 00:30:02.615
It's just a prejudice on the basis

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:05.589
of probably an over-generalized 
social class distinction

00:30:05.613 --> 00:30:08.668
which is too simplistic
to apply in reality.

00:30:08.692 --> 00:30:11.634
Those of us in New York know
there are some people in New York

00:30:11.658 --> 00:30:14.585
who are completely awesome,
and some people who are pathetic,

00:30:14.609 --> 00:30:18.343
and if you live in Iowa, some people
are awesome and some people are pathetic.

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:20.435
It's not a question
of what degree you have

00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:22.507
or where you happen to live
in the country.

00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:26.005
The distinction is just a crude
simplification to arouse political power.

00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:30.614
GC: But I would encourage people
to watch a television news show

00:30:30.638 --> 00:30:33.307
or read a column
that they normally wouldn't.

00:30:34.221 --> 00:30:39.247
So if you are a Trump supporter,
watch the other side for a day,

00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:41.292
because you need to come out of the bubble

00:30:41.316 --> 00:30:43.418
if you're ever going
to have a conversation.

00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:46.056
And both sides -- so if you're a liberal,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.911
then watch something
that's very conservative.

00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:52.583
Read a column that is not something
you would normally read,

00:30:52.607 --> 00:30:55.897
because then you gain perspective
of what the other side is thinking,

00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:58.381
and to me, that's a start
of coming together.

00:30:58.405 --> 00:31:01.246
I worry about the same thing
you worry about, these bubbles.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.290
I think if you only watch
certain entities,

00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:06.245
you have no idea what the rest
of the world is talking about.

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:08.778
DB: I think not only watching,

00:31:08.802 --> 00:31:11.816
being part of an organization
that meets at least once a month

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.170
that puts you in direct contact
with people completely unlike yourself

00:31:15.194 --> 00:31:17.345
is something we all have
a responsibility for.

00:31:17.369 --> 00:31:18.836
I may get this a little wrong,

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.105
but I think of the top-selling
automotive models in this country,

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:25.451
I think the top three or four
are all pickup trucks.

00:31:25.475 --> 00:31:29.287
So ask yourself: How many people
do I know who own a pickup truck?

00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:32.740
And it could be very few or zero
for a lot of people.

00:31:32.764 --> 00:31:35.718
And that's sort of a warning sign
kind of a problem.

00:31:35.742 --> 00:31:37.491
Where can I join a club

00:31:37.515 --> 00:31:40.929
where I'll have a lot in common
with a person who drives a pickup truck

00:31:40.953 --> 00:31:43.128
because we have a common
interest in whatever?

00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:45.964
CA: And so the internet is definitely
contributing to this.

00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:48.141
A question here from Chris Ajemian:

00:31:48.165 --> 00:31:50.290
"How do you feel structure
of communications,

00:31:50.314 --> 00:31:54.044
especially the prevalence of social
media and individualized content,

00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:56.538
can be used to bring together
a political divide,

00:31:56.562 --> 00:31:59.797
instead of just filing communities
into echo chambers?"

00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:04.270
I mean, it looks like Facebook
and Google, since the election,

00:32:04.294 --> 00:32:05.973
are working hard on this question.

00:32:05.997 --> 00:32:09.815
They're trying to change the algorithms

00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:13.478
so that they don't amplify fake news

00:32:13.502 --> 00:32:15.908
to the extent that it happened
last time round.

00:32:15.932 --> 00:32:18.156
Do you see any other
promising signs of ...?

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.283
GC: ... or amplify one side
of the equation.

00:32:20.307 --> 00:32:21.458
CA: Exactly.

00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:25.847
GC: I think that was the constant
argument from the right,

00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:28.441
that social media
and the internet in general

00:32:28.465 --> 00:32:32.287
was putting articles towards the top
that were not their worldview.

00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:35.253
I think, again, that fed into the anger.

00:32:35.277 --> 00:32:36.812
It fed into the anger of:

00:32:36.836 --> 00:32:39.616
"You're pushing something
that's not what I believe."

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.060
But social media has obviously
changed everything,

00:32:42.084 --> 00:32:46.461
and I think Trump is the example
of Twitter changing absolutely everything.

00:32:46.485 --> 00:32:48.488
And from his point of view,

00:32:48.512 --> 00:32:52.809
he's reaching the American people
without a filter,

00:32:52.833 --> 00:32:55.548
which he believes the media is.

00:32:57.365 --> 00:32:59.784
CA: Question from the audience.

00:33:00.498 --> 00:33:02.323
Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:06.677
I have a question regarding political
correctness, and I'm curious:

00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:11.371
When did political correctness
become synonymous with silencing,

00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:16.510
versus a way that we speak
about other people

00:33:16.534 --> 00:33:19.673
to show them respect
and preserve their dignity?

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:23.085
GC: Well, I think the conservative media
really pounded this issue

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:24.973
for the last 10 years.

00:33:24.997 --> 00:33:28.358
I think that they really, really
spent a lot of time

00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:30.188
talking about political correctness,

00:33:30.212 --> 00:33:33.615
and how people should have
the ability to say what they think.

00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:35.809
Another reason why Trump
became so popular:

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:37.711
because he says what he thinks.

00:33:37.735 --> 00:33:42.367
It also makes me think about the fact

00:33:43.756 --> 00:33:46.791
that I do believe there are a lot
of people in America

00:33:46.815 --> 00:33:50.707
who agree with Steve Bannon,

00:33:50.731 --> 00:33:52.670
but they would never say it publicly,

00:33:52.694 --> 00:33:55.778
and so voting for Trump
gave them the opportunity

00:33:55.802 --> 00:33:57.406
to agree with it silently.

00:33:58.816 --> 00:34:03.780
DB: On the issue of immigration,
it's a legitimate point of view

00:34:03.804 --> 00:34:06.231
that we have too many immigrants
in the country,

00:34:06.255 --> 00:34:07.721
that it's economically costly.

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.101
CA: That we have too many --

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.734
DB: Immigrants in the country,
especially from Britain.

00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:12.932
(Laughter)

00:34:12.956 --> 00:34:15.706
GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.077
CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.

00:34:18.101 --> 00:34:19.756
(Laughter)

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.497
I'll go now.

00:34:21.521 --> 00:34:27.445
DB: But it became
sort of impermissible to say that,

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.914
because it was a sign that somehow
you must be a bigot of some sort.

00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:34.889
So the political correctness
was not only cracking down on speech

00:34:34.913 --> 00:34:37.136
that we would all find
completely offensive,

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.942
it was cracking down on some speech
that was legitimate,

00:34:39.966 --> 00:34:44.514
and then it was turning speech
and thought into action

00:34:44.538 --> 00:34:46.598
and treating it as a crime,

00:34:46.622 --> 00:34:49.542
and people getting fired
and people thrown out of schools,

00:34:49.566 --> 00:34:51.308
and there were speech codes written.

00:34:51.332 --> 00:34:53.126
Now there are these diversity teams,

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.830
where if you say something
that somebody finds offensive,

00:34:55.854 --> 00:34:59.550
like, "Smoking is really dangerous,"
you can say "You're insulting my group,"

00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:03.112
and the team from the administration
will come down into your dorm room

00:35:03.136 --> 00:35:05.677
and put thought police upon you.

00:35:05.701 --> 00:35:10.890
And so there has been a genuine narrowing
of what is permissible to say.

00:35:10.914 --> 00:35:12.782
And some of it is legitimate.

00:35:12.806 --> 00:35:18.169
There are certain words that there
should be some social sanction against,

00:35:18.193 --> 00:35:21.167
but some of it was used
to enforce a political agenda.

00:35:21.191 --> 00:35:22.404
CA: So is that a project

00:35:22.428 --> 00:35:25.408
you would urge on liberals,
if you like -- progressives --

00:35:25.432 --> 00:35:30.349
to rethink the ground rules
around political correctness

00:35:30.373 --> 00:35:36.068
and accept a little more
uncomfortable language

00:35:36.092 --> 00:35:38.926
in certain circumstances?

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.684
Can you see that being solved

00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:44.911
to an extent that others
won't be so offended?

00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:48.259
DB: I mean, most American universities,
especially elite universities,

00:35:48.283 --> 00:35:49.816
are overwhelmingly on the left,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.702
and there's just an ease of temptation

00:35:51.726 --> 00:35:55.919
to use your overwhelming cultural power
to try to enforce some sort of thought

00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:58.232
that you think is right
and correct thought.

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:01.459
So, be a little more self-suspicious
of, are we doing that?

00:36:01.483 --> 00:36:04.959
And second, my university,
the University of Chicago,

00:36:04.983 --> 00:36:07.713
sent out this letter saying,
we will have no safe spaces.

00:36:07.737 --> 00:36:10.147
There will be no critique
of micro-aggression.

00:36:10.171 --> 00:36:13.632
If you get your feelings hurt,
well, welcome to the world of education.

00:36:13.656 --> 00:36:15.070
I do think that policy --

00:36:15.094 --> 00:36:18.428
which is being embraced by a lot
of people on the left, by the way --

00:36:18.452 --> 00:36:20.618
is just a corrective to what's happened.

00:36:20.642 --> 00:36:22.751
CA: So here's a question
from Karen Holloway:

00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:25.105
How do we foster an American culture

00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:27.653
that's forward-looking, like Hamilton,

00:36:27.677 --> 00:36:30.205
that expects and deals with change,

00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:33.913
rather than wanting to have everything
go back to some fictional past?

00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:36.682
That's an easy question, right?

00:36:36.706 --> 00:36:39.297
GC: Well, I'm still a believer
in the American dream,

00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:42.755
and I think what we can teach
our children is the basics,

00:36:42.779 --> 00:36:46.176
which is that hard work

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.710
and believing in yourself

00:36:49.597 --> 00:36:51.817
in America, you can achieve
whatever you want.

00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:53.502
I was told that every single day.

00:36:53.526 --> 00:36:57.557
When I got in the real world, I was like,
wow, that's maybe not always so true.

00:36:57.581 --> 00:36:59.252
But I still believe in that.

00:36:59.276 --> 00:37:00.849
Maybe I'm being too optimistic.

00:37:00.873 --> 00:37:04.584
So I still look towards the future
for that to continue.

00:37:05.108 --> 00:37:07.270
DB: I think you're being too optimistic.

00:37:07.294 --> 00:37:08.452
GC: You do?

00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:12.508
DB: The odds of an American young person
exceeding their parents' salary --

00:37:12.532 --> 00:37:15.069
a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.

00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:16.852
Now 51 percent do it.

00:37:16.876 --> 00:37:20.144
There's just been a problem
in social mobility in the country.

00:37:20.168 --> 00:37:24.997
CA: You've written that this entire
century has basically been a disaster,

00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:30.654
that the age of sunny growth is over
and we're in deep trouble.

00:37:30.678 --> 00:37:35.137
DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged,
in real terms, population-adjusted,

00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:37.281
two or three percent growth for 50 years,

00:37:37.305 --> 00:37:39.849
and now we've had less
than one percent growth.

00:37:39.873 --> 00:37:42.372
And so there's something seeping out.

00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:46.969
And so if I'm going to tell people
that they should take risks,

00:37:46.993 --> 00:37:50.040
one of the things we're seeing
is a rapid decline in mobility,

00:37:50.064 --> 00:37:53.433
the number of people who are moving
across state lines,

00:37:53.457 --> 00:37:56.472
and that's especially true
among millennials.

00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:58.386
It's young people that are moving less.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.311
So how do we give people the security
from which they can take risk?

00:38:02.335 --> 00:38:05.917
And I'm a big believer in attachment
theory of raising children,

00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:08.525
and attachment theory
is based on the motto

00:38:08.549 --> 00:38:12.971
that all of life is a series
of daring adventures from a secure base.

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:15.952
Have you parents given you a secure base?

00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:18.349
And as a society,
we do not have a secure base,

00:38:18.373 --> 00:38:22.761
and we won't get to that "Hamilton,"
risk-taking, energetic ethos

00:38:22.785 --> 00:38:25.242
until we can supply a secure base.

00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:28.665
CA: So I wonder whether
there's ground here

00:38:28.689 --> 00:38:33.446
to create almost like a shared agenda,
a bridging conversation,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:38.816
on the one hand recognizing
that there is this really deep problem

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.345
that the system,
the economic system that we built,

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:44.289
seems to be misfiring right now.

00:38:45.244 --> 00:38:50.614
Second, that maybe, if you're right
that it's not all about immigrants,

00:38:50.638 --> 00:38:52.596
it's probably more about technology,

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.644
if you could win that argument,

00:38:54.668 --> 00:38:59.837
that de-emphasizes what seems to me
the single most divisive territory

00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:03.915
between Trump supporters and others,
which is around the role of the other.

00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:07.989
It's very offensive to people on the left
to have the other demonized

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:10.718
to the extent that the other
seems to be demonized.

00:39:10.742 --> 00:39:13.320
That feels deeply immoral,

00:39:13.344 --> 00:39:16.214
and maybe people on the left
could agree, as you said,

00:39:16.238 --> 00:39:19.099
that immigration
may have happened too fast,

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:23.700
and there is a limit beyond which
human societies struggle,

00:39:23.724 --> 00:39:27.813
but nonetheless this whole problem
becomes de-emphasized

00:39:27.837 --> 00:39:29.972
if automation is the key issue,

00:39:29.996 --> 00:39:32.950
and then we try to work together
on recognizing that it's real,

00:39:32.974 --> 00:39:36.103
recognizing that the problem
probably wasn't properly addressed

00:39:36.127 --> 00:39:37.473
or seen or heard,

00:39:37.497 --> 00:39:40.806
and try to figure out
how to rebuild communities

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.838
using, well, using what?

00:39:42.862 --> 00:39:46.898
That seems to me to become
the fertile conversation of the future:

00:39:46.922 --> 00:39:50.042
How do we rebuild communities
in this modern age,

00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:52.398
with technology doing what it's doing,

00:39:52.422 --> 00:39:54.617
and reimagine this bright future?

00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:56.744
GC: That's why I go back to optimism.

00:39:56.768 --> 00:40:00.643
I'm not being ... it's not like
I'm not looking at the facts,

00:40:00.667 --> 00:40:03.105
where we've come or where we've come from.

00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:07.116
But for gosh sakes, if we don't look
at it from an optimistic point of view --

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.844
I'm refusing to do that just yet.

00:40:08.868 --> 00:40:13.082
I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old
to say, "Look, the world is dim."

00:40:13.106 --> 00:40:16.102
CA; We're going to have
one more question from the room here.

00:40:16.126 --> 00:40:19.792
Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.

00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:23.320
You both mentioned
the infrastructure plan and Russia

00:40:23.344 --> 00:40:28.709
and some other things that wouldn't be
traditional Republican priorities.

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:35.302
What do you think, or when,
will Republicans be motivated

00:40:35.326 --> 00:40:39.311
to take a stand against Trumpism?

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:42.662
GC: After last night, not for a while.

00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:45.036
He changed a lot last night, I believe.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.711
DB: His popularity among Republicans --
he's got 85 percent approval,

00:40:48.735 --> 00:40:50.955
which is higher than Reagan
had at this time,

00:40:50.979 --> 00:40:53.895
and that's because society
has just gotten more polarized.

00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:56.568
So people follow the party
much more than they used to.

00:40:56.592 --> 00:40:59.748
So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan
and the Republicans in Congress

00:40:59.772 --> 00:41:00.931
to flake away,

00:41:00.955 --> 00:41:02.604
it's going to take a little while.

00:41:02.628 --> 00:41:06.110
GC: But also because they're all
concerned about reelection,

00:41:06.134 --> 00:41:09.829
and Trump has so much power
with getting people either for you

00:41:09.853 --> 00:41:11.294
or against you,

00:41:11.318 --> 00:41:13.656
and so, they're vacillating
every day, probably:

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.796
"Well, should I go against
or should I not?"

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.319
But last night, where he finally
sounded presidential,

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:23.075
I think most Republicans are breathing
a sigh of relief today.

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:25.389
DB: The half-life of that is short.

00:41:25.413 --> 00:41:28.668
GC: Right -- I was just going to say,
until Twitter happens again.

00:41:28.692 --> 00:41:31.760
CA: OK, I want to give
each of you the chance

00:41:31.784 --> 00:41:35.611
to imagine you're speaking
to -- I don't know --

00:41:35.635 --> 00:41:37.586
the people online who are watching this,

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.156
who may be Trump supporters,

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.232
who may be on the left,
somewhere in the middle.

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:49.624
How would you advise them to bridge
or to relate to other people?

00:41:49.648 --> 00:41:53.797
Can you share any final wisdom on this?

00:41:53.821 --> 00:41:57.595
Or if you think that they shouldn't,
tell them that as well.

00:41:57.619 --> 00:41:59.255
GC: I would just start by saying

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:03.590
that I really think any change
and coming together starts from the top,

00:42:03.614 --> 00:42:05.552
just like any other organization.

00:42:06.714 --> 00:42:09.592
And I would love if, somehow,

00:42:09.616 --> 00:42:14.179
Trump supporters or people on the left
could encourage their leaders

00:42:14.203 --> 00:42:16.755
to show that compassion from the top,

00:42:16.779 --> 00:42:20.453
because imagine the change
that we could have

00:42:20.477 --> 00:42:22.605
if Donald Trump tweeted out today,

00:42:22.629 --> 00:42:24.290
to all of his supporters,

00:42:24.314 --> 00:42:26.974
"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.

00:42:26.998 --> 00:42:28.672
Let's have more understanding.

00:42:28.696 --> 00:42:31.526
As a leader, I'm going
to be more inclusive

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.485
to all of the people of America."

00:42:34.392 --> 00:42:36.485
To me, it starts at the top.

00:42:36.509 --> 00:42:39.886
Is he going to do that? I have no idea.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.610
But I think that everything
starts from the top,

00:42:42.634 --> 00:42:44.363
and the power that he has

00:42:44.387 --> 00:42:47.376
in encouraging his supporters

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.213
to have an understanding of where
people are coming from on the other side.

00:42:52.497 --> 00:42:54.996
CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.762
I don't think we can teach
each other to be civil,

00:42:57.786 --> 00:42:59.529
and give us sermons on civility.

00:42:59.553 --> 00:43:00.797
That's not going to do it.

00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:02.505
It's substance and how we act,

00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:06.148
and the nice thing about Donald Trump
is he smashed our categories.

00:43:06.172 --> 00:43:10.294
All the categories that we thought
we were thinking in, they're obsolete.

00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:13.400
They were great for the 20th century.
They're not good for today.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:16.655
He's got an agenda which is about
closing borders and closing trade.

00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:18.504
I just don't think it's going to work.

00:43:18.528 --> 00:43:21.349
I think if we want to rebuild
communities, recreate jobs,

00:43:21.373 --> 00:43:23.027
we need a different set of agenda

00:43:23.051 --> 00:43:26.622
that smashes through all our current
divisions and our current categories.

00:43:26.646 --> 00:43:30.162
For me, that agenda is Reaganism
on macroeconomic policy,

00:43:30.186 --> 00:43:32.356
Sweden on welfare policy

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.582
and cuts across right and left.

00:43:34.606 --> 00:43:37.543
I think we have to have a dynamic
economy that creates growth.

00:43:37.567 --> 00:43:39.400
That's the Reagan on economic policy.

00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:41.389
But people have to have that secure base.

00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:43.464
There have to be
nurse-family partnerships;

00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:45.266
there has to be universal preschool;

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.285
there have to be charter schools;

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:50.277
there have to be college programs
with wraparound programs

00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:51.782
for parents and communities.

00:43:51.806 --> 00:43:56.802
We need to help heal the crisis
of social solidarity in this country

00:43:56.826 --> 00:43:58.322
and help heal families,

00:43:58.346 --> 00:44:00.680
and government just has to get
a lot more involved

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:04.367
in the way liberals like
to rebuild communities.

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:07.613
At the other hand, we have to have
an economy that's free and open

00:44:07.637 --> 00:44:09.563
the way conservatives used to like.

00:44:09.587 --> 00:44:12.645
And so getting the substance right
is how you smash through

00:44:12.669 --> 00:44:14.061
the partisan identities,

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:17.388
because the substance is what
ultimately shapes our polarization.

00:44:18.752 --> 00:44:20.721
CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much

00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:22.880
for an absolutely
fascinating conversation.

00:44:22.904 --> 00:44:26.041
Thank you. That was really,
really interesting.

00:44:26.065 --> 00:44:29.388
(Applause)

00:44:29.412 --> 00:44:33.680
Hey, let's keep the conversation going.

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.821
We're continuing to try and figure out

00:44:35.845 --> 00:44:37.481
whether we can add something here,

00:44:37.505 --> 00:44:39.546
so keep the conversation
going on Facebook.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.260
Give us your thoughts from whatever part
of the political spectrum you're on,

00:44:43.284 --> 00:44:45.345
and actually, wherever
in the world you are.

00:44:45.369 --> 00:44:48.127
This is not just about America.
It's about the world, too.

00:44:49.476 --> 00:44:51.810
But we're not going
to end today without music,

00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:56.626
because if we put music
in every political conversation,

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.088
the world would be
completely different, frankly.

00:44:59.112 --> 00:45:00.890
It just would.

00:45:00.914 --> 00:45:03.521
(Applause)

00:45:03.545 --> 00:45:05.635
Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman,

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:08.084
Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here --

00:45:08.108 --> 00:45:09.349
let's get a shot of her.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:12.742
(Applause)

00:45:12.766 --> 00:45:17.049
She created this program
that brings teens together,

00:45:17.073 --> 00:45:20.517
teaches them the joy
and the impact of gospel music,

00:45:20.541 --> 00:45:24.520
and hundreds of teens have gone
through this program.

00:45:24.544 --> 00:45:26.063
It's transformative for them.

00:45:26.087 --> 00:45:28.275
The music they made, as you already heard,

00:45:28.299 --> 00:45:29.605
is extraordinary,

00:45:29.629 --> 00:45:34.003
and I can't think of a better way
of ending this TED Dialogue

00:45:34.027 --> 00:45:37.834
than welcoming Vy Higginsen's
Gospel Choir from Harlem.

00:45:37.858 --> 00:45:39.035
Thank you.

00:45:39.059 --> 00:45:42.217
(Applause)

00:45:58.888 --> 00:46:03.522
(Singing) Choir: O beautiful
for spacious skies

00:46:03.546 --> 00:46:08.478
For amber waves of grain

00:46:08.502 --> 00:46:13.226
For purple mountain majesties

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.956
Above the fruited plain

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.151
America!

00:46:22.649 --> 00:46:25.273
America!

00:46:27.182 --> 00:46:29.388
America!

00:46:30.546 --> 00:46:33.806
America!

00:46:36.318 --> 00:46:40.970
God shed his grace on thee

00:46:40.994 --> 00:46:45.409
And crown thy good with brotherhood

00:46:45.433 --> 00:46:52.420
From sea to shining sea

00:46:59.648 --> 00:47:06.645
From sea to shining sea

00:47:13.417 --> 00:47:20.247
(Applause)
