00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:03.647
I'm going to be talking
about statistics today.

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.809
If that makes you immediately feel
a little bit wary, that's OK,

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.692
that doesn't make you some
kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:11.012
it makes you skeptical.

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.922
And when it comes to numbers,
especially now, you should be skeptical.

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:17.957
But you should also be able to tell
which numbers are reliable

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:19.141
and which ones aren't.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.371
So today I want to try to give you
some tools to be able to do that.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.564
But before I do,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.427
I just want to clarify which numbers
I'm talking about here.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.086
I'm not talking about claims like,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.559
"9 out of 10 women recommend
this anti-aging cream."

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.555
I think a lot of us always
roll our eyes at numbers like that.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.563
What's different now is people
are questioning statistics like,

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:38.601
"The US unemployment
rate is five percent."

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.141
What makes this claim different is
it doesn't come from a private company,

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.553
it comes from the government.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.913
About 4 out of 10 Americans
distrust the economic data

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:48.510
that gets reported by government.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.025
Among supporters of President Trump
it's even higher;

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.682
it's about 7 out of 10.

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.510
I don't need to tell anyone here

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.545
that there are a lot of dividing lines
in our society right now,

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.394
and a lot of them start to make sense,

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.105
once you understand people's relationships
with these government numbers.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.465
On the one hand, there are those who say
these statistics are crucial,

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.119
that we need them to make sense
of society as a whole

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:11.307
in order to move beyond
emotional anecdotes

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.741
and measure progress
in an [objective] way.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:15.232
And then there are the others,

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:17.412
who say that these statistics are elitist,

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:18.644
maybe even rigged;

00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:21.062
they don't make sense
and they don't really reflect

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:23.382
what's happening
in people's everyday lives.

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.893
It kind of feels like that second group
is winning the argument right now.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.025
We're living in a world
of alternative facts,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.984
where people don't find statistics
this kind of common ground,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.644
this starting point for debate.

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:34.954
This is a problem.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.045
There are actually
moves in the US right now

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.930
to get rid of some government
statistics altogether.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.341
Right now there's a bill in congress
about measuring racial inequality.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:46.166
The draft law says that government
money should not be used

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.092
to collect data on racial segregation.

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:50.001
This is a total disaster.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:51.773
If we don't have this data,

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:53.575
how can we observe discrimination,

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.877
let alone fix it?

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:56.089
In other words:

00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:58.172
How can a government create fair policies

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.967
if they can't measure
current levels of unfairness?

00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.785
This isn't just about discrimination,

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:04.479
it's everything -- think about it.

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:06.193
How can we legislate on health care

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.488
if we don't have good data
on health or poverty?

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:10.710
How can we have public debate
about immigration

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.984
if we can't at least agree

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.651
on how many people are entering
and leaving the country?

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.733
Statistics come from the state;
that's where they got their name.

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:19.914
The point was to better
measure the population

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:21.295
in order to better serve it.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.044
So we need these government numbers,

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:25.715
but we also have to move
beyond either blindly accepting

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.007
or blindly rejecting them.

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.028
We need to learn the skills
to be able to spot bad statistics.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.580
I started to learn some of these

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:33.770
when I was working
in a statistical department

00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:35.437
that's part of the United Nations.

00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.867
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis
had been forced from their homes

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.049
as a result of the war,

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:41.231
and what they needed.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.433
It was really important work,
but it was also incredibly difficult.

00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:46.475
Every single day, we were making decisions

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.656
that affected the accuracy
of our numbers --

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.424
decisions like which parts
of the country we should go to,

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:52.604
who we should speak to,

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:54.196
which questions we should ask.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.900
And I started to feel
really disillusioned with our work,

00:02:56.924 --> 00:02:59.442
because we thought we were doing
a really good job,

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:02.744
but the one group of people
who could really tell us were the Iraqis,

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:06.308
and they rarely got the chance to find
our analysis, let alone question it.

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.163
So I started to feel really determined

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.498
that the one way to make
numbers more accurate

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:13.575
is to have as many people as possible
be able to question them.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.033
So I became a data journalist.

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:18.961
My job is finding these data sets
and sharing them with the public.

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:22.158
Anyone can do this,
you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.537
You can ignore those words;
they're used by people

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:27.383
trying to say they're smart
while pretending they're humble.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.996
Absolutely anyone can do this.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.087
I want to give you guys three questions

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.116
that will help you be able to spot
some bad statistics.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.647
So, question number one
is: Can you see uncertainty?

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.035
One of things that's really changed
people's relationship with numbers,

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.700
and even their trust in the media,

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:44.982
has been the use of political polls.

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.544
I personally have a lot of issues
with political polls

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:50.944
because I think the role of journalists
is actually to report the facts

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:52.521
and not attempt to predict them,

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:55.541
especially when those predictions
can actually damage democracy

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.297
by signaling to people:
don't bother to vote for that guy,

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.526
he doesn't have a chance.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.204
Let's set that aside for now and talk
about the accuracy of this endeavor.

00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:07.836
Based on national elections
in the UK, Italy, Israel

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.624
and of course, the most recent
US presidential election,

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:12.785
using polls to predict electoral outcomes

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.621
is about as accurate as using the moon
to predict hospital admissions.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:20.845
No, seriously, I used actual data
from an academic study to draw this.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:24.596
There are a lot of reasons why
polling has become so inaccurate.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.590
Our societies have become really diverse,

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:30.435
which makes it difficult for pollsters
to get a really nice representative sample

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.086
of the population for their polls.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.116
People are really reluctant to answer
their phones to pollsters,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.416
and also, shockingly enough,
people might lie.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.251
But you wouldn't necessarily
know that to look at the media.

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:43.036
For one thing, the probability
of a Hillary Clinton win

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.851
was communicated with decimal places.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:48.496
We don't use decimal places
to describe the temperature.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.748
How on earth can predicting the behavior
of 230 million voters in this country

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.601
be that precise?

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.627
And then there were those sleek charts.

00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:00.624
See, a lot of data visualizations
will overstate certainty, and it works --

00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.268
these charts can numb
our brains to criticism.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:05.850
When you hear a statistic,
you might feel skeptical.

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.509
As soon as it's buried in a chart,

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.662
it feels like some kind
of objective science,

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:10.935
and it's not.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.062
So I was trying to find ways
to better communicate this to people,

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.590
to show people the uncertainty
in our numbers.

00:05:16.614 --> 00:05:18.860
What I did was I started taking
real data sets,

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.536
and turning them into
hand-drawn visualizations,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.232
so that people can see
how imprecise the data is;

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.252
so people can see that a human did this,

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:28.248
a human found the data and visualized it.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.944
For example, instead
of finding out the probability

00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:33.094
of getting the flu in any given month,

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:35.910
you can see the rough
distribution of flu season.

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:37.101
This is --

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.143
(Laughter)

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:39.653
a bad shot to show in February.

00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:42.132
But it's also more responsible
data visualization,

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.611
because if you were to show
the exact probabilities,

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.227
maybe that would encourage
people to get their flu jabs

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:48.707
at the wrong time.

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:50.856
The point of these shaky lines

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.791
is so that people remember
these imprecisions,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:57.042
but also so they don't necessarily
walk away with a specific number,

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:58.932
but they can remember important facts.

00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:02.980
Facts like injustice and inequality
leave a huge mark on our lives.

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:07.193
Facts like Black Americans and Native
Americans have shorter life expectancies

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:08.617
than those of other races,

00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:10.779
and that isn't changing anytime soon.

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:14.704
Facts like prisoners in the US
can be kept in solitary confinement cells

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:18.070
that are smaller than the size
of an average parking space.

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:21.870
The point of these visualizations
is also to remind people

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:24.244
of some really important
statistical concepts,

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:25.904
concepts like averages.

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:27.596
So let's say you hear a claim like,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.054
"The average swimming pool in the US
contains 6.23 fecal accidents."

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.875
That doesn't mean every single
swimming pool in the country

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:37.093
contains exactly 6.23 turds.

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:38.534
So in order to show that,

00:06:38.558 --> 00:06:41.399
I went back to the original data,
which comes from the CDC,

00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:43.488
who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.

00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:45.903
And I just spent one evening
redistributing poop.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:48.609
So you can kind of see
how misleading averages can be.

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.915
(Laughter)

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.840
OK, so the second question
that you guys should be asking yourselves

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:55.365
to spot bad numbers is:

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.356
Can I see myself in the data?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.293
This question is also
about averages in a way,

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:02.922
because part of the reason
why people are so frustrated

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:04.441
with these national statistics,

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.738
is they don't really tell the story
of who's winning and who's losing

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:08.918
from national policy.

00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:12.260
It's easy to understand why people
are frustrated with global averages

00:07:12.284 --> 00:07:14.963
when they don't match up
with their personal experiences.

00:07:14.987 --> 00:07:18.250
I wanted to show people the way
data relates to their everyday lives.

00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:20.520
I started this advice column
called "Dear Mona,"

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.270
where people would write to me
with questions and concerns

00:07:23.294 --> 00:07:25.078
and I'd try to answer them with data.

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:26.302
People asked me anything.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:29.587
questions like, "Is it normal to sleep
in a separate bed to my wife?"

00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:31.202
"Do people regret their tattoos?"

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:33.390
"What does it mean to die
of natural causes?"

00:07:33.414 --> 00:07:36.380
All of these questions are great,
because they make you think

00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:38.740
about ways to find
and communicate these numbers.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.267
If someone asks you,
"How much pee is a lot of pee?"

00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.749
which is a question that I got asked,

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:46.753
you really want to make sure
that the visualization makes sense

00:07:46.777 --> 00:07:48.524
to as many people as possible.

00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:50.123
These numbers aren't unavailable.

00:07:50.147 --> 00:07:53.654
Sometimes they're just buried
in the appendix of an academic study.

00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:55.517
And they're certainly not inscrutable;

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.516
if you really wanted to test
these numbers on urination volume,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.797
you could grab a bottle
and try it for yourself.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:01.829
(Laughter)

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:03.547
The point of this isn't necessarily

00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:06.448
that every single data set
has to relate specifically to you.

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.352
I'm interested in how many women
were issued fines in France

00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:11.335
for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:13.977
even if I don't live in France
or wear the face veil.

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.836
The point of asking where you fit in
is to get as much context as possible.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.051
So it's about zooming out
from one data point,

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.179
like the unemployment rate
is five percent,

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.960
and seeing how it changes over time,

00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:26.634
or seeing how it changes
by educational status --

00:08:26.658 --> 00:08:29.762
this is why your parents always
wanted you to go to college --

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.818
or seeing how it varies by gender.

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:33.969
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:35.693
than the female unemployment rate.

00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:38.412
Up until the early '80s,
it was the other way around.

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:40.553
This is a story of one
of the biggest changes

00:08:40.577 --> 00:08:42.297
that's happened in American society,

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.597
and it's all there in that chart,
once you look beyond the averages.

00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.786
The axes are everything;

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.479
once you change the scale,
you can change the story.

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:52.883
OK, so the third and final question
that I want you guys to think about

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.726
when you're looking at statistics is:

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.623
How was the data collected?

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.606
So far, I've only talked about the way
data is communicated,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.906
but the way it's collected
matters just as much.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.097
I know this is tough,

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:07.202
because methodologies can be opaque
and actually kind of boring,

00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:10.099
but there are some simple steps
you can take to check this.

00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:11.962
I'll use one last example here.

00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:16.196
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims
in this country support jihad,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.745
which is obviously pretty scary,

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:20.411
and it was reported everywhere in 2015.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.050
When I want to check a number like that,

00:09:23.074 --> 00:09:25.575
I'll start off by finding
the original questionnaire.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:28.525
It turns out that journalists
who reported on that statistic

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:30.780
ignored a question
lower down on the survey

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:33.150
that asked respondents
how they defined "jihad."

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.155
And most of them defined it as,

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:39.121
"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle
to be more religious."

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:43.339
Only 16 percent defined it as,
"violent holy war against unbelievers."

00:09:43.363 --> 00:09:45.793
This is the really important point:

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:47.972
based on those numbers,
it's totally possible

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:51.101
that no one in the survey
who defined it as violent holy war

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.457
also said they support it.

00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:54.689
Those two groups might not overlap at all.

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:57.759
It's also worth asking
how the survey was carried out.

00:09:57.783 --> 00:09:59.781
This was something called an opt-in poll,

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:03.207
which means anyone could have found it
on the internet and completed it.

00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:06.570
There's no way of knowing
if those people even identified as Muslim.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:09.206
And finally, there were 600
respondents in that poll.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.884
There are roughly three million
Muslims in this country,

00:10:11.908 --> 00:10:13.515
according to Pew Research Center.

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:16.532
That means the poll spoke to roughly
one in every 5,000 Muslims

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:17.724
in this country.

00:10:17.748 --> 00:10:19.014
This is one of the reasons

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:22.645
why government statistics
are often better than private statistics.

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:25.704
A poll might speak to a couple
hundred people, maybe a thousand,

00:10:25.728 --> 00:10:28.786
or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell
skin care products in 2005,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.227
then you spoke to 48 women
to claim that they work.

00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:32.277
(Laughter)

00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:35.857
Private companies don't have a huge
interest in getting the numbers right,

00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.636
they just need the right numbers.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.680
Government statisticians aren't like that.

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.151
In theory, at least,
they're totally impartial,

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.676
not least because most of them do
their jobs regardless of who's in power.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.862
They're civil servants.

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:48.850
And to do their jobs properly,

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:51.237
they don't just speak
to a couple hundred people.

00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.579
Those unemployment numbers
I keep on referencing

00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:55.607
come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:56.966
and to make their estimates,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.479
they speak to over 140,000
businesses in this country.

00:11:00.503 --> 00:11:02.228
I get it, it's frustrating.

00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:05.367
If you want to test a statistic
that comes from a private company,

00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:08.752
you can buy the face cream for you
and a bunch of friends, test it out,

00:11:08.776 --> 00:11:11.367
if it doesn't work,
you can say the numbers were wrong.

00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:13.537
But how do you question
government statistics?

00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:15.191
You just keep checking everything.

00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:17.128
Find out how they collected the numbers.

00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:20.277
Find out if you're seeing everything
on the chart you need to see.

00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:23.266
But don't give up on the numbers
altogether, because if you do,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.729
we'll be making public policy
decisions in the dark,

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:28.015
using nothing but private
interests to guide us.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.205
Thank you.

00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:31.690
(Applause)
