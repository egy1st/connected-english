00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:03.296
It was just an ordinary Saturday.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.536
My dad was outside mowing the lawn,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.816
my mom was upstairs folding laundry,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.976
my sister was in her room doing homework

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.360
and I was in the basement
playing video games.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.416
And as I came upstairs
to get something to drink,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.656
I looked out the window

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.976
and realized that there was something
that I was supposed to be doing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.200
and this is what I saw.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.976
No, this wasn't
my family's dinner on fire.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.640
This was my science project.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.696
Flames were pouring out,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.936
smoke was in the air

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.176
and it looked like our wooden deck
was about to catch fire.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.016
I immediately started yelling.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.536
My mom was freaking out,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.656
my dad ran around to put out the fire

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.816
and of course my sister
started recording a Snapchat video.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.736
(Laughter)

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960
This was just the beginning
of my team's science project.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.136
My team is composed of me
and three other students

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.840
who are here in the audience today.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.296
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.856
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.736
and in addition to a robotics game,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.136
we also worked
on a separate science project,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.856
and this was the project
that we were working on.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.856
So the idea for this project all started

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.136
when a few months earlier,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.976
a couple of my teammates
took a trip to Central America

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.496
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.480
or expanded polystyrene foam.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.176
And when they came back
and told us about it,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.896
we really started thinking about the ways
in which we see Styrofoam every day.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.536
Get a new flat-screen TV?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.520
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.536
Drink a cup of coffee?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.736
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
are sure going to add up.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.136
And where do all these items go
after their one-time use?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.576
Since there aren't any good
existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.136
almost all of them
end up right in the landfill,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.496
or the oceans and beaches,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.216
taking over 500 years to degrade.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.456
And in fact, every year, the US alone

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.136
produces over two billion
pounds of Styrofoam,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.336
filling up a staggering
25 percent of landfills.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.440
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.840
Why can't we just recycle them
like many plastics?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.816
Well, simply put, recycled
polystyrene is too expensive

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.416
and potentially contaminated,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.656
so there is very little market demand
for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.216
And as a result, Styrofoam
is considered a nonrenewable material,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.000
because it is neither feasible
nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.176
And in fact, many cities across the US

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.616
have even passed ordinances

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.256
that simply ban the production
of many products containing polystyrene,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.336
which includes disposable utensils,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.536
packing peanuts, takeout containers

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.696
and even plastic beach toys,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.696
all products that are very useful
in today's society.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.896
And now France
has become the first country

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.176
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
cups and plates.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.696
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.456
and keep benefiting
from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.216
and excellent packing ability,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.576
while not having to suffer
from the repercussions

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.920
of having to dispose of it?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.816
What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.400
What if we could make
the impossible possible?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.976
My team hypothesized that we could use
the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.696
to create activated carbon,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.080
which is used in almost
every water filter today.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.096
And activated carbon works
by using very small micropores

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080
to filter out contaminants
from water or even air.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.016
So we started out
by doing a variety of heating tests,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.120
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.176
Literally, nothing worked.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.456
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.136
most of our samples
vaporized into nothing,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.576
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040
In fact, we were so saddened
by our failures that we almost gave up.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.696
So why did we keep trying

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.096
when all the adults
said it was impossible?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.040
Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
We don't know any better.

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.256
But the truth is, we kept trying
because we thought it was still possible.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.976
We knew that if we were successful,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.416
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.096
So we kept trying

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.856
and failing

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.536
and trying

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.136
and failing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.800
We were so ready to give up.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.216
But then it happened.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.936
With the right temperatures,
times and chemicals,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.216
we finally got that successful test result

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.055
showing us that we had created
activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.656
And at that moment,
the thing that had been impossible

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.920
all of a sudden wasn't.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.536
It showed us that although we had
many failures at the beginning,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.256
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.216
And moreover, not only were we able
to create activated carbon

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.496
for purifying water,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.976
but we were also able
to reduce Styrofoam waste,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.760
solving two global problems
with just one solution.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.256
So from then on, we were inspired
to take our project further,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.496
performing more tests
to make it more effective

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.856
and testing it in real world situations.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.616
We then proceeded to receive funding

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.616
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
STEM-in-Action program

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.376
sponsored by the US Army,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.776
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.080
sponsored by XPRIZE.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.896
And we were also honored

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.696
with the Scientific American
Innovator Award

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.960
from Google Science Fair.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.936
And using these funds, we plan
to file a full patent on our process

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.840
and to continue to work on our project.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.616
So yes, although we started
with catching my dad's grill on fire

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.136
and failing so many times
that we almost quit,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.696
it was well worth it
when we look back at it now.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.536
We took a problem
that many people said was impossible

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.056
and we made it possible,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.336
and we persevered when it looked
like nothing that we did would work.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.456
We learned that you can't have success

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.976
without a little,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.760
or a lot, of failure.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.056
So in the future, don't be afraid
if your grill goes up in flames,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.960
because you never know
when your idea might just catch fire.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.016
Thank you.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.520
(Applause)
