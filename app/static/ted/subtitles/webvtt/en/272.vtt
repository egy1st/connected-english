00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:04.190
Philosophers, dramatists, theologians

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.420
have grappled with
this question for centuries:

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:07.976
what makes people go wrong?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.976
Interestingly, I asked this question
when I was a little kid.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.056
I grew up in the South Bronx,
inner-city ghetto in New York,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.563
and I was surrounded by evil,

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:18.143
as all kids are who grew up
in an inner city.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.492
And I had friends
who were really good kids,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:24.808
who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde
scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:27.976
That is, they took drugs,
got in trouble, went to jail.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.859
Some got killed, and some did it
without drug assistance.

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:35.082
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,
that wasn't fiction.

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:37.330
The only question is,
what was in the juice?

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.976
And more importantly, that line
between good and evil --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.468
which privileged people like to think
is fixed and impermeable,

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:47.165
with them on the good side,
the others on the bad side --

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.252
I knew that line was movable,
and it was permeable.

00:00:50.276 --> 00:00:52.619
Good people could be
seduced across that line,

00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:56.847
and under good and some rare
circumstances, bad kids could recover

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.167
with help, with reform,
with rehabilitation.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.477
So I want to begin
with this wonderful illusion

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.775
by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.660
If you look at it and focus on the white,
what you see is a world full of angels.

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:11.252
But let's look more deeply, and as we do,

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:14.297
what appears is the demons,
the devils in the world.

00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:16.213
That tells us several things.

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:19.345
One, the world is, was, will always
be filled with good and evil,

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.417
because good and evil is the yin and yang
of the human condition.

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:23.727
It tells me something else.

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.779
If you remember,
God's favorite angel was Lucifer.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.727
Apparently, Lucifer means "the light."

00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:32.477
It also means "the morning star,"
in some scripture.

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:35.706
And apparently, he disobeyed God,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.222
and that's the ultimate
disobedience to authority.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:43.744
And when he did, Michael, the archangel,
was sent to kick him out of heaven

00:01:43.768 --> 00:01:45.771
along with the other fallen angels.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.976
And so Lucifer descends into hell,
becomes Satan,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
becomes the devil, and the force
of evil in the universe begins.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:56.493
Paradoxically, it was God
who created hell as a place to store evil.

00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.357
He didn't do a good job
of keeping it there though.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:03.970
So, this arc of the cosmic transformation
of God's favorite angel into the Devil,

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:07.638
for me, sets the context
for understanding human beings

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:11.976
who are transformed from good,
ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:16.604
So the Lucifer effect,
although it focuses on the negatives --

00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:19.283
the negatives that people can become,

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:21.269
not the negatives that people are --

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:24.647
leads me to a psychological definition.

00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:26.644
Evil is the exercise of power.

00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:28.907
And that's the key: it's about power.

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.496
To intentionally harm
people psychologically,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.250
to hurt people physically,
to destroy people mortally, or ideas,

00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:37.468
and to commit crimes against humanity.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.286
If you Google "evil," a word that should
surely have withered by now,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.976
you come up with 136 million hits
in a third of a second.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.498
A few years ago -- I am sure
all of you were shocked, as I was,

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:55.976
with the revelation of American soldiers
abusing prisoners in a strange place

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.976
in a controversial war,
Abu Ghraib in Iraq.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.007
And these were men and women

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.318
who were putting prisoners
through unbelievable humiliation.

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:07.786
I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.976
because I had seen
those same visual parallels

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.402
when I was the prison superintendent
of the Stanford Prison Study.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.141
Immediately the Bush
administration military said what?

00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:19.021
What all administrations say
when there's a scandal:

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:20.895
"Don't blame us. It's not the system.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.319
It's the few bad apples,
the few rogue soldiers."

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:26.374
My hypothesis is,
American soldiers are good, usually.

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:28.459
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.976
But how am I going to deal
with that hypothesis?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.520
I became an expert witness
for one of the guards,

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:35.687
Sergeant Chip Frederick,
and in that position,

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.624
I had access to the dozen
investigative reports.

00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:40.448
I had access to him.

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:43.773
I could study him, have him come
to my home, get to know him,

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:47.204
do psychological analysis to see,
was he a good apple or bad apple.

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:51.139
And thirdly, I had access
to all of the 1,000 pictures

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:52.376
that these soldiers took.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.375
These pictures are
of a violent or sexual nature.

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.358
All of them come from the cameras
of American soldiers.

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:01.668
Because everybody has
a digital camera or cell phone camera,

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:04.026
they took pictures of everything,
more than 1,000.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.004
And what I've done is I organized them
into various categories.

00:04:07.028 --> 00:04:11.967
But these are by United States
military police, army reservists.

00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:15.959
They are not soldiers prepared
for this mission at all.

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:19.656
And it all happened in a single place,
Tier 1-A, on the night shift.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.881
Why?

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:23.507
Tier 1-A was the center
for military intelligence.

00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:25.507
It was the interrogation hold.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:26.732
The CIA was there.

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:29.914
Interrogators from
Titan Corporation, all there,

00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:32.724
and they're getting no information
about the insurgency.

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:35.218
So they're going to put pressure
on these soldiers,

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.962
military police, to cross the line,

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:39.976
give them permission to break
the will of the enemy,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.477
to prepare them for interrogation,
to soften them up,

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:43.727
to take the gloves off.

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.879
Those are the euphemisms,
and this is how it was interpreted.

00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:49.404
Let's go down to that dungeon.

00:04:51.285 --> 00:04:52.594
(Typewriting)

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:58.627
[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008

00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:05.445

and graphic depictions of violence]

00:05:06.178 --> 00:05:07.311

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:36.425
(Bells end)

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.865
So, pretty horrific.

00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.148
That's one of the visual
illustrations of evil.

00:06:43.172 --> 00:06:44.933
And it should not have escaped you

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:48.194
that the reason I paired
the prisoner with his arms out

00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:50.976
with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.582
is that that prisoner was mentally ill.

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:55.959
That prisoner covered himself
with shit every day,

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.401
they had to roll him in dirt
so he wouldn't stink.

00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:00.773
But the guards ended up
calling him "Shit Boy."

00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:04.976
What was he doing in that prison
rather than in some mental institution?

00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:08.212
In any event, here's former
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.

00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:11.046
He comes down and says,
"I want to know, who is responsible?

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.449
Who are the bad apples?"

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:13.881
Well, that's a bad question.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.526
You have to reframe it and ask,
"What is responsible?"

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.198
"What" could be the who of people,

00:07:18.222 --> 00:07:20.759
but it could also be
the what of the situation,

00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:22.469
and obviously that's wrongheaded.

00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:26.338
How do psychologists try to understand
such transformations of human character,

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.362
if you believe
that they were good soldiers

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:30.196
before they went down to that dungeon?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.082
There are three ways.
The main way is called dispositional.

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:35.976
We look at what's inside
of the person, the bad apples.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.311
This is the foundation
of all of social science,

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:41.995
the foundation of religion,
the foundation of war.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.239
Social psychologists like me
come along and say,

00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.382
"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,

00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:49.756
but you'll have to be aware
of the situation.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.161
Who are the cast of characters?
What's the costume?

00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:53.644
Is there a stage director?"

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.335
And so we're interested in
what are the external factors

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:58.335
around the individual -- the bad barrel?

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:01.551
Social scientists stop there
and they miss the big point

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:04.814
that I discovered when I became
an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:06.389
The power is in the system.

00:08:06.413 --> 00:08:09.654
The system creates the situation
that corrupts the individuals,

00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:14.462
and the system is the legal, political,
economic, cultural background.

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:17.780
And this is where the power
is of the bad-barrel makers.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:20.640
If you want to change a person,
change the situation.

00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:24.053
And to change it, you've got to know
where the power is, in the system.

00:08:24.077 --> 00:08:26.125
So the Lucifer effect
involves understanding

00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:30.604
human character transformations
with these three factors.

00:08:31.124 --> 00:08:32.513
And it's a dynamic interplay.

00:08:32.537 --> 00:08:34.603
What do the people bring
into the situation?

00:08:34.627 --> 00:08:36.635
What does the situation bring out of them?

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.976
And what is the system
that creates and maintains that situation?

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.908
My recent book,
"The Lucifer Effect," is about,

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:45.171
how do you understand
how good people turn evil?

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:48.458
And it has a lot of detail
about what I'm going to talk about today.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.976
So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect,"
although it focuses on evil,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.160
really is a celebration of the human
mind's infinite capacity

00:08:56.184 --> 00:08:58.742
to make any of us kind or cruel,

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:01.288
caring or indifferent,
creative or destructive,

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.590
and it makes some of us villains.

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:06.711
And the good news that I'm going
to hopefully come to at the end

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:08.502
is that it makes some of us heroes.

00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:13.200
This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker
summarizes my whole talk:

00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:15.367
"I'm neither a good cop
nor a bad cop, Jerome.

00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:17.350
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam

00:09:17.374 --> 00:09:19.843
of positive and negative
personality traits

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:23.357
that emerge or not, depending
on the circumstances."

00:09:23.381 --> 00:09:25.366
(Laughter)

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.242
There's a study some of you
think you know about,

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:30.453
but very few people
have ever read the story.

00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:32.402
You watched the movie.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:35.775
This is Stanley Milgram,
little Jewish kid from the Bronx,

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:38.898
and he asked the question,
"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"

00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:42.427
People say, "No, that's Nazi Germany,
Hitler, you know, that's 1939."

00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.844
He said, "Yeah, but suppose
Hitler asked you,

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:48.038
'Would you electrocute a stranger?'
'No way, I'm a good person.'"

00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:50.158
He said, "Why don't
we put you in a situation

00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:52.421
and give you a chance
to see what you would do?"

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:55.530
And so what he did was he tested
1,000 ordinary people.

00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:59.621
500 New Haven, Connecticut,
500 Bridgeport.

00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:02.360
And the ad said, "Psychologists
want to understand memory.

00:10:02.384 --> 00:10:05.678
We want to improve people's memory,
because it is the key to success."

00:10:05.702 --> 00:10:06.902
OK?

00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:11.889
"We're going to give you five bucks --
four dollars for your time.

00:10:11.913 --> 00:10:15.367
We don't want college students.
We want men between 20 and 50."

00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.153
In the later studies, they ran women.

00:10:17.177 --> 00:10:20.250
Ordinary people: barbers,
clerks, white-collar people.

00:10:20.274 --> 00:10:21.854
So, you go down,

00:10:21.878 --> 00:10:24.389
one of you will be a learner,
one will be a teacher.

00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:26.318
The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.

00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:29.451
He gets tied up to the shock
apparatus in another room.

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:33.043
The learner could be middle-aged,
could be as young as 20.

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:36.283
And one of you is told by the authority,
the guy in the lab coat,

00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:38.922
"Your job as teacher is to give him
material to learn.

00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:40.160
Gets it right, reward.

00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:42.575
Gets it wrong, you press
a button on the shock box.

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.453
The first button is 15 volts.
He doesn't even feel it."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.163
That's the key.

00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:48.976
All evil starts with 15 volts.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.411
And then the next step
is another 15 volts.

00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:54.846
The problem is, at the end
of the line, it's 450 volts.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.976
And as you go along, the guy is screaming,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.191
"I've got a heart condition!
I'm out of here!"

00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:00.921
You're a good person. You complain.

00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:03.801
"Sir, who will be responsible
if something happens to him?"

00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:06.588
The experimenter says,
"Don't worry, I will be responsible.

00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:07.941
Continue, teacher."

00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:11.770
And the question is, who would go
all the way to 450 volts?

00:11:11.794 --> 00:11:14.370
You should notice here,
when it gets up to 375,

00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:15.919
it says, "Danger. Severe Shock."

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:19.283
When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" --
the pornography of power.

00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:21.847
So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,

00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:24.976
"What percent of American citizens
would go to the end?"

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.501
They said only one percent.

00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:30.091
Because that's sadistic behavior,
and we know, psychiatry knows,

00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:32.207
only one percent
of Americans are sadistic.

00:11:32.231 --> 00:11:33.431
OK.

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:36.593
Here's the data.
They could not be more wrong.

00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:39.438
Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.

00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:40.976
This was just one study.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.284
Milgram did more than 16 studies.

00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:44.541
And look at this.

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.168
In study 16, where you see
somebody like you go all the way,

00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:49.660
90 percent go all the way.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:52.475
In study five, if you see people rebel,

00:11:52.499 --> 00:11:53.842
90 percent rebel.

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:57.457
What about women?
Study 13 -- no different than men.

00:11:57.778 --> 00:12:01.319
So Milgram is quantifying evil
as the willingness of people

00:12:01.343 --> 00:12:04.136
to blindly obey authority,
to go all the way to 450 volts.

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:06.568
And it's like a dial on human nature.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:10.976
A dial in a sense that you can make
almost everybody totally obedient,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.690
down to the majority, down to none.

00:12:14.607 --> 00:12:17.607
What are the external parallels?
For all research is artificial.

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:19.441
What's the validity in the real world?

00:12:19.465 --> 00:12:22.479
912 American citizens
committed suicide or were murdered

00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:25.488
by family and friends
in Guyana jungle in 1978,

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:28.542
because they were blindly obedient
to this guy, their pastor --

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:31.273
not their priest -- their pastor,
Reverend Jim Jones.

00:12:31.297 --> 00:12:34.093
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.

00:12:34.117 --> 00:12:35.982
And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.858
a man of God who becomes
the Angel of Death.

00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:44.896
Milgram's study is all about individual
authority to control people.

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:47.976
Most of the time, we are in institutions,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.537
so the Stanford Prison Study
is a study of the power of institutions

00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:53.501
to influence individual behavior.

00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:57.129
Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I
were in the same high school class

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.857
in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.

00:13:00.976 --> 00:13:03.063
I did this study
with my graduate students,

00:13:03.087 --> 00:13:05.913
especially Craig Haney --
and it also began work with an ad.

00:13:05.937 --> 00:13:07.365
We had a cheap, little ad,

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:10.141
but we wanted college students
for a study of prison life.

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.529
75 people volunteered,
took personality tests.

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:14.803
We did interviews.

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.273
Picked two dozen: the most normal,
the most healthy.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.564
Randomly assigned them
to be prisoner and guard.

00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:21.608
So on day one, we knew we had good apples.

00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.585
I'm going to put them in a bad situation.

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:25.886
And secondly, we know
there's no difference

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.252
between the boys who will be guards
and those who will be prisoners.

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:30.802
To the prisoners, we said,

00:13:30.826 --> 00:13:32.952
"Wait at home. The study
will begin Sunday."

00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:34.176
We didn't tell them

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.395
that the city police were going
to come and do realistic arrests.

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:39.051
(Video) (Music)

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.039
[Day 1]

00:14:11.313 --> 00:14:16.287
Student: A police car pulls up in front,
and a cop comes to the front door,

00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:18.306
and knocks, and says he's looking for me.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.251
So they, right there, you know,
they took me out the door,

00:14:21.275 --> 00:14:24.773
they put my hands against the car.

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.998
It was a real cop car,
it was a real policeman,

00:14:27.022 --> 00:14:29.085
and there were real
neighbors in the street,

00:14:29.109 --> 00:14:32.135
who didn't know
that this was an experiment.

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:35.383
And there was cameras
all around and neighbors all around.

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.623
They put me in the car,
then they drove me around Palo Alto.

00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:45.171
They took me to the basement
of the police station.

00:14:52.213 --> 00:14:53.607
Then they put me in a cell.

00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.549
I was the first one to be picked up,
so they put me in a cell,

00:14:56.573 --> 00:14:59.366
which was just like a room
with a door with bars on it.

00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:02.080
You could tell it wasn't a real jail.

00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:05.866
They locked me in there,
in this degrading little outfit.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.185
They were taking
this experiment too seriously.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:13.042
Here are the prisoners, who are going
to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:15.958
Here are the guards
with the symbols of power and anonymity.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:19.431
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet
bowls out with their bare hands,

00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:20.927
to do other humiliating tasks.

00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:23.193
They strip them naked.
They sexually taunt them.

00:15:23.217 --> 00:15:26.754
They begin to do degrading activities,
like having them simulate sodomy.

00:15:26.778 --> 00:15:30.009
You saw simulating fellatio
in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:31.915
My guards did it in five days.

00:15:32.335 --> 00:15:34.162
The stress reaction was so extreme

00:15:34.186 --> 00:15:36.622
that normal kids we picked
because they were healthy

00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:38.229
had breakdowns within 36 hours.

00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:42.278
The study ended after six days,
because it was out of control.

00:15:42.302 --> 00:15:44.432
Five kids had emotional breakdowns.

00:15:46.306 --> 00:15:47.759
Does it make a difference

00:15:47.783 --> 00:15:50.508
if warriors go to battle
changing their appearance or not?

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:53.285
If they're anonymous,
how do they treat their victims?

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:56.468
In some cultures, they go to war
without changing their appearance.

00:15:56.492 --> 00:15:59.220
In others, they paint themselves
like "Lord of the Flies."

00:15:59.244 --> 00:16:00.436
In some, they wear masks.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.521
In many, soldiers
are anonymous in uniform.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:07.242
So this anthropologist, John Watson, found
23 cultures that had two bits of data.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.605
Do they change their appearance? 15.

00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:11.936
Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.063
If they don't change their appearance,

00:16:14.087 --> 00:16:16.300
only one of eight kills,
tortures or mutilates.

00:16:16.324 --> 00:16:17.628
The key is in the red zone.

00:16:17.652 --> 00:16:19.217
If they change their appearance,

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:22.458
12 of 13 -- that's 90 percent --
kill, torture, mutilate.

00:16:22.976 --> 00:16:24.596
And that's the power of anonymity.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.525
So what are the seven social processes

00:16:26.549 --> 00:16:28.407
that grease the slippery slope of evil?

00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:30.557
Mindlessly taking the first small step.

00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:33.223
Dehumanization of others.
De-individuation of self.

00:16:33.247 --> 00:16:35.149
Diffusion of personal responsibility.

00:16:35.173 --> 00:16:36.820
Blind obedience to authority.

00:16:36.844 --> 00:16:38.738
Uncritical conformity to group norms.

00:16:38.762 --> 00:16:41.976
Passive tolerance of evil
through inaction, or indifference.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.858
And it happens when you're
in a new or unfamiliar situation.

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:46.931
Your habitual response
patterns don't work.

00:16:46.955 --> 00:16:49.402
Your personality
and morality are disengaged.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.953
"Nothing is easier
than to denounce the evildoer;

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:55.999
nothing more difficult
than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.

00:16:56.023 --> 00:16:59.595
Understanding is not excusing.
Psychology is not excuse-ology.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:02.186
So social and psychological
research reveals

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.482
how ordinary, good people can be
transformed without the drugs.

00:17:05.506 --> 00:17:08.807
You don't need it. You just need
the social-psychological processes.

00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:10.526
Real world parallels?

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.734
Compare this with this.

00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:16.664
James Schlesinger --
I'm going to end with this -- says,

00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:19.287
"Psychologists have attempted
to understand how and why

00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.740
individuals and groups
who usually act humanely

00:17:21.764 --> 00:17:24.952
can sometimes act otherwise
in certain circumstances."

00:17:24.976 --> 00:17:26.215
That's the Lucifer effect.

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:28.668
And he goes on to say,
"The landmark Stanford study

00:17:28.692 --> 00:17:32.612
provides a cautionary tale
for all military operations."

00:17:32.636 --> 00:17:34.976
If you give people power
without oversight,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.483
it's a prescription for abuse.

00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:38.918
They knew that, and let that happen.

00:17:39.677 --> 00:17:42.757
So another report, an investigative
report by General Fay,

00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:44.731
says the system is guilty.

00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:48.218
In this report, he says it was
the environment that created Abu Ghraib,

00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:51.624
by leadership failures that contributed
to the occurrence of such abuse,

00:17:51.648 --> 00:17:53.558
and because it remained undiscovered

00:17:53.582 --> 00:17:55.822
by higher authorities
for a long period of time.

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.671
Those abuses went on for three months.

00:17:57.695 --> 00:17:59.303
Who was watching the store?

00:17:59.327 --> 00:18:01.574
The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.

00:18:01.598 --> 00:18:03.891
He gave the guards permission
to do those things,

00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:06.979
and they knew nobody was ever going
to come down to that dungeon.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.571
So you need a paradigm shift
in all of these areas.

00:18:09.595 --> 00:18:13.272
The shift is away from the medical model
that focuses only on the individual.

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:15.976
The shift is toward a public health model

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.782
that recognizes situational
and systemic vectors of disease.

00:18:19.806 --> 00:18:22.143
Bullying is a disease.
Prejudice is a disease.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:23.335
Violence is a disease.

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:27.127
Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing
with problems at the individual level.

00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:28.592
It doesn't work.

00:18:28.616 --> 00:18:31.432
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,
"The line between good and evil

00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:33.576
cuts through the heart
of every human being."

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.412
That means that line is not out there.

00:18:35.436 --> 00:18:38.407
That's a decision that you have
to make, a personal thing.

00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.976
So I want to end very quickly
on a positive note.

00:18:41.492 --> 00:18:43.952
Heroism as the antidote to evil,

00:18:43.976 --> 00:18:45.871
by promoting the heroic imagination,

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:48.393
especially in our kids,
in our educational system.

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:50.881
We want kids to think,
"I'm a hero in waiting,

00:18:50.905 --> 00:18:53.048
waiting for the right
situation to come along,

00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:54.615
and I will act heroically.

00:18:54.639 --> 00:18:57.317
My whole life, I'm now going
to focus away from evil --

00:18:57.341 --> 00:19:00.294
that I've been in since I was a kid
-- to understanding heroes.

00:19:00.318 --> 00:19:01.483
Banality of heroism.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.511
It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.

00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:06.481
It's the counterpoint
to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."

00:19:06.505 --> 00:19:10.466
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong,
because they are the exceptions.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.825
They organize their life around this.
That's why we know their names.

00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:16.127
Our kids' heroes
are also wrong models for them,

00:19:16.151 --> 00:19:18.095
because they have supernatural talents.

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:21.080
We want our kids to realize
most heroes are everyday people,

00:19:21.104 --> 00:19:23.208
and the heroic act is unusual.

00:19:23.232 --> 00:19:24.523
This is Joe Darby.

00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:26.833
He was the one that stopped
those abuses you saw,

00:19:26.857 --> 00:19:28.450
because when he saw those images,

00:19:28.474 --> 00:19:31.045
he turned them over
to a senior investigating officer.

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.797
He was a low-level private,
and that stopped it.

00:19:33.821 --> 00:19:34.999
Was he a hero? No.

00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:38.173
They had to put him in hiding,
because people wanted to kill him,

00:19:38.197 --> 00:19:39.849
and then his mother and his wife.

00:19:39.873 --> 00:19:41.758
For three years, they were in hiding.

00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:44.468
This is the woman who stopped
the Stanford Prison Study.

00:19:44.492 --> 00:19:47.741
When I said it got out of control,
I was the prison superintendent.

00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:50.764
I didn't know it was out of control.
I was totally indifferent.

00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:52.379
She saw that madhouse and said,

00:19:52.403 --> 00:19:55.308
"You know what, it's terrible
what you're doing to those boys.

00:19:55.332 --> 00:19:58.976
They're not prisoners nor guards,
they're boys, and you are responsible."

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.976
And I ended the study the next day.

00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:03.649
The good news
is I married her the next year.

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:05.976
(Laughter)

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
(Applause)

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:15.456
I just came to my senses, obviously.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.149
So situations have the power
to do [three things].

00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:20.954
But the point is,
this is the same situation

00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:24.444
that can inflame the hostile
imagination in some of us,

00:20:24.468 --> 00:20:26.205
that makes us perpetrators of evil,

00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:28.422
can inspire the heroic
imagination in others.

00:20:28.446 --> 00:20:31.560
It's the same situation
and you're on one side or the other.

00:20:31.584 --> 00:20:33.775
Most people are guilty
of the evil of inaction,

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:37.147
because your mother said, "Don't get
involved. Mind your own business."

00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:39.648
And you have to say,
"Mama, humanity is my business."

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:42.863
So the psychology of heroism is --
we're going to end in a moment --

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:45.314
how do we encourage children
in new hero courses,

00:20:45.338 --> 00:20:48.630
that I'm working on with Matt Langdon --
he has a hero workshop --

00:20:48.654 --> 00:20:51.697
to develop this heroic imagination,
this self-labeling,

00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:54.484
"I am a hero in waiting,"
and teach them skills.

00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:56.863
To be a hero, you have
to learn to be a deviant,

00:20:56.887 --> 00:20:59.887
because you're always going
against the conformity of the group.

00:21:00.537 --> 00:21:04.377
Heroes are ordinary people whose social
actions are extraordinary. Who act.

00:21:04.401 --> 00:21:06.152
The key to heroism is two things.

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:08.557
You have to act
when other people are passive.

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:11.348
B: You have to act socio-centrically,
not egocentrically.

00:21:11.372 --> 00:21:15.155
And I want to end with a known story
about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:18.976
Fifty-year-old African-American
construction worker standing on a subway.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.528
A white guy falls on the tracks.

00:21:20.552 --> 00:21:23.012
The subway train is coming.
There's 75 people there.

00:21:23.036 --> 00:21:24.532
You know what? They freeze.

00:21:24.556 --> 00:21:26.422
He's got a reason not to get involved.

00:21:26.446 --> 00:21:28.863
He's black, the guy's white,
and he's got two kids.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.840
Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,

00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:33.341
jumps on the tracks,
puts the guy between the tracks,

00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:35.535
lays on him, the subway goes over him.

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:38.817
Wesley and the guy --
20 and a half inches height.

00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:41.131
The train clearance is 21 inches.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.783
A half an inch
would have taken his head off.

00:21:44.377 --> 00:21:48.446
And he said, "I did what anyone could do,"
no big deal to jump on the tracks.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.118
And the moral imperative
is "I did what everyone should do."

00:21:52.142 --> 00:21:54.529
And so one day,
you will be in a new situation.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.620
Take path one, you're going
to be a perpetrator of evil.

00:21:57.644 --> 00:21:59.976
Evil, meaning you're going to be
Arthur Andersen.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.715
You're going to cheat,
or you're going to allow bullying.

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.553
Path two, you become guilty
of the evil of passive inaction.

00:22:05.577 --> 00:22:07.300
Path three, you become a hero.

00:22:07.324 --> 00:22:11.742
The point is, are we ready to take
the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:13.970
waiting for the right
situation to come along

00:22:13.994 --> 00:22:16.060
to put heroic imagination into action?

00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:18.878
Because it may only happen
once in your life,

00:22:18.902 --> 00:22:21.045
and when you pass it by,
you'll always know,

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:23.504
I could have been a hero
and I let it pass me by.

00:22:23.528 --> 00:22:25.701
So the point is thinking it
and then doing it.

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:28.347
So I want to thank you. Thank you.

00:22:28.371 --> 00:22:31.373
Let's oppose the power of evil systems
at home and abroad,

00:22:31.397 --> 00:22:32.976
and let's focus on the positive.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.521
Advocate for respect of personal dignity,
for justice and peace,

00:22:36.545 --> 00:22:38.883
which sadly our administration
has not been doing.

00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:40.157
Thanks so much.

00:22:40.181 --> 00:22:43.290
(Applause)
