00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.719
Have you ever heard the one
about how breastfeeding is free?

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.416
(Laughter)

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.656
Yeah, it's pretty funny,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.760
because it's only free if we don't value
women's time and energy.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.696
Any mother can tell you
how much time and energy it takes

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.656
to liquify her body --

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.216
to literally dissolve herself --

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.816
(Laughter)

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.720
as she feeds this precious
little cannibal.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.336
(Laughter)

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.680
Milk is why mammals suck.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.296
At Arizona State University,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.256
in the Comparative Lactation Lab,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.056
I decode mothers' milk composition

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.056
to understand its complexity

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.480
and how it influences infant development.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080
The most important thing that I've learned

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.920
is that we do not do enough
to support mothers and babies.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.896
And when we fail mothers and babies,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.280
we fail everyone
who loves mothers and babies:

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.256
the fathers, the partners,
the grandparents, the aunties,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.360
the friends and kin
that make our human social networks.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.216
It's time that we abandon
simple solutions and simple slogans,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.960
and grapple with the nuance.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.776
I was very fortunate

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.456
to run smack-dab
into that nuance very early,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.520
during my first interview
with a journalist

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.856
when she asked me,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.160
"How long should a mother
breastfeed her baby?"

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.920
And it was that word "should"
that brought me up short,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.960
because I will never tell a woman
what she should do with her body.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.576
Babies survive and thrive

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.256
because their mother's milk
is food, medicine and signal.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.496
For young infants,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.456
mother's milk is a complete diet

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.056
that provides all the building
blocks for their bodies,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.456
that shapes their brain

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.640
and fuels all of their activity.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.776
Mother's milk also feeds the microbes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.240
that are colonizing
the infant's intestinal tract.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.536
Mothers aren't just eating for two,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.720
they're eating for two to the trillions.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.000
Milk provides immunofactors
that help fight pathogens

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and mother's milk provides hormones
that signal to the infant's body.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.296
But in recent decades,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.456
we have come to take milk for granted.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.456
We stopped seeing
something in plain sight.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.616
We began to think of milk as standardized,
homogenized, pasteurized,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.600
packaged, powdered,
flavored and formulated.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.856
We abandoned the milk of human kindness

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.920
and turned our priorities elsewhere.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.296
At the National Institutes of Health

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.936
in Washington DC

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.800
is the National Library of Medicine,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.256
which contains 25 million articles --

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.520
the brain trust of life science
and biomedical research.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.456
We can use keywords
to search that database,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.736
and when we do that,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.840
we discover nearly a million
articles about pregnancy,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.000
but far fewer about
breast milk and lactation.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.840
When we zoom in on the number of articles
just investigating breast milk,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.976
we see that we know much more
about coffee, wine and tomatoes.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.200
(Laughter)

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.216
We know over twice as much
about erectile dysfunction.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760
(Laughter)

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.816
I'm not saying we shouldn't
know about those things --

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.536
I'm a scientist, I think
we should know about everything.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.896
But that we know so much less --

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.696
(Laughter)

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.016
about breast milk --

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.816
the first fluid a young mammal
is adapted to consume --

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.200
should make us angry.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.456
Globally, nine out of 10 women will
have at least one child in her lifetime.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.936
That means that nearly 130 million
babies are born each year.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.080
These mothers and babies
deserve our best science.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.736
Recent research has shown
that milk doesn't just grow the body,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000
it fuels behavior
and shapes neurodevelopment.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.816
In 2015, researchers discovered

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.816
that the mixture of breast milk
and baby saliva --

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.896
specifically, baby saliva --

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.736
causes a chemical reaction
that produces hydrogen peroxide

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520
that can kill staph and salmonella.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.056
And from humans and other mammal species,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.496
we're starting to understand
that the biological recipe of milk

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.640
can be different when produced
for sons or daughters.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.176
When we reach for donor milk
in the neonatal intensive care unit,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.176
or formula on the store shelf,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.520
it's nearly one-size-fits-all.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.216
We aren't thinking about how sons
and daughters may grow at different rates,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.456
or different ways,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.200
and that milk may be a part of that.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.136
Mothers have gotten the message

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.576
and the vast majority of mothers
intend to breastfeed,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.440
but many do not reach
their breastfeeding goals.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.616
That is not their failure;

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.080
it's ours.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.336
Increasingly common medical conditions
like obesity, endocrine disorders,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.976
C-section and preterm births

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.600
all can disrupt the underlying
biology of lactation.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.000
And many women do not have
knowledgeable clinical support.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.896
Twenty-five years ago,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.776
the World Health Organization
and UNICEF established criteria

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.376
for hospitals to be
considered baby friendly --

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.216
that provide the optimal level
of support for mother-infant bonding

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.560
and infant feeding.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.856
Today, only one in five babies
in the United States

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.040
is born in a baby-friendly hospital.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.456
This is a problem,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.336
because mothers can grapple
with many problems

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.416
in the minutes, hours, days
and weeks of lactation.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.936
They can have struggles
with establishing latch,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.176
with pain,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.416
with milk letdown

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.920
and perceptions of milk supply.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.496
These mothers deserve
knowledgeable clinical staff

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.720
that understand these processes.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.000
Mothers will call me as they're
grappling with these struggles,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.280
crying with wobbly voices.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.600
"It's not working.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.896
This is what I'm supposed
to naturally be able to do.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.160
Why is it not working?"

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.080
And just because something
is evolutionarily ancient

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.800
doesn't mean that it's easy
or that we're instantly good at it.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.216
You know what else
is evolutionarily ancient?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.520
(Laughter)

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.496
Sex.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.456
And nobody expects us
to start out being good at it.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.640
(Laughter)

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.016
Clinicians best deliver
quality equitable care

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.056
when they have continuing education

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200
about how to best support
lactation and breastfeeding.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.056
And in order to have
that continuing education,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.216
we need to anchor it
to cutting-edge research

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.736
in both the life sciences
and the social sciences,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.456
because we need to recognize

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.760
that too often

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.056
historical traumas and implicit biases

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.600
sit in the space between
a new mother and her clinician.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.280
The body is political.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.456
If our breastfeeding support
is not intersectional,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.360
it's not good enough.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.096
And for moms who have to return for work,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.136
because countries like the United States
do not provide paid parental leave,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.320
they can have to go back in as short
as just a few days after giving birth.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.736
How do we optimize
mother and infant health

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.096
just by messaging
about breast milk to moms

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.896
without providing
the institutional support

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.576
that facilitates
that mother-infant bonding

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.040
to support breastfeeding?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.680
The answer is: we can't.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.456
I'm talking to you, legislators,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.416
and the voters who elect them.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.136
I'm talking to you, job creators
and collective bargaining units,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.320
and workers, and shareholders.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.296
We all have a stake
in the public health of our community,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.280
and we all have a role
to play in achieving it.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.280
Breast milk is a part
of improving human health.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.016
In the NICU, when infants are born
early or sick or injured,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.760
milk or bioactive constituents in milk
can be critically important.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.776
Environments or ecologies,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.016
or communities where there's
high risk of infectious disease,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.496
breast milk can be incredibly protective.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.135
Where there are emergencies
like storms and earthquakes,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.655
when the electricity goes out,

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.655
when safe water is not available,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.480
breast milk can keep babies
fed and hydrated.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.056
And in the context of humanitarian crises,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.280
like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.760
the smallest drops can buffer babies
from the biggest global challenges.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.216
But understanding breast milk
is not just about messaging to mothers

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.760
and policy makers.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.176
It's also about understanding
what is important in breast milk

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.976
so that we can deliver better formulas

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.800
to moms who cannot or do not
breastfeed for whatever reason.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.256
We can all do a better job

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.576
of supporting the diversity
of moms raising their babies

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.320
in a diversity of ways.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.536
As women around the world struggle

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.216
to achieve political,
social and economic equality,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.776
we must reimagine motherhood

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.016
as not the central,
core aspect of womanhood,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.520
but one of the many potential facets
of what makes women awesome.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.280
It's time.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.443
(Applause)
