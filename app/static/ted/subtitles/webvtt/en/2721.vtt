WEBVTT

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.604
So it all came to life

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:04.460
in a dark bar in Madrid.

00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:09.247
I encountered my colleague
from McGill, Michael Meaney.

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.576
And we were drinking a few beers,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.653
and like scientists do,

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:15.123
he told me about his work.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:23.258
And he told me that he is interested
in how mother rats lick their pups

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:24.652
after they were born.

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:28.075
And I was sitting there and saying,

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
"This is where my tax
dollars are wasted --

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:32.157
(Laughter)

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.959
on this kind of soft science."

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.332
And he started telling me

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.756
that the rats, like humans,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.226
lick their pups in very different ways.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.985
Some mothers do a lot of that,

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.214
some mothers do very little,

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:51.208
and most are in between.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.768
But what's interesting about it

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:58.710
is when he follows these pups
when they become adults --

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:02.913
like, years in human life,
long after their mother died.

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:05.005
They are completely different animals.

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.402
The animals that were licked
and groomed heavily,

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:11.178
the high-licking and grooming,

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:13.423
are not stressed.

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:16.271
They have different sexual behavior.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.250
They have a different way of living

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:24.754
than those that were not treated
as intensively by their mothers.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.098
So then I was thinking to myself:

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.414
Is this magic?

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.371
How does this work?

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.604
As geneticists would like you to think,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.362
perhaps the mother had
the "bad mother" gene

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.023
that caused her pups to be stressful,

00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:45.594
and then it was passed
from generation to generation;

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:48.318
it's all determined by genetics.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:51.836
Or is it possible that something
else is going on here?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.431
In rats, we can ask
this question and answer it.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.060
So what we did is
a cross-fostering experiment.

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:03.839
You essentially separate the litter,
the babies of this rat, at birth,

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:05.730
to two kinds of fostering mothers --

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:09.082
not the real mothers,
but mothers that will take care of them:

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.360
high-licking mothers
and low-licking mothers.

00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:15.262
And you can do the opposite
with the low-licking pups.

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:18.081
And the remarkable answer was,

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:22.144
it wasn't important
what gene you got from your mother.

00:02:22.168 --> 00:02:27.916
It was not the biological mother
that defined this property of these rats.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.946
It is the mother that
took care of the pups.

00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:35.596
So how can this work?

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.724
I am an a epigeneticist.

00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:42.420
I am interested in how genes are marked

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:44.160
by a chemical mark

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:48.989
during embryogenesis, during the time
we're in the womb of our mothers,

00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:51.492
and decide which gene will be expressed

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:52.698
in what tissue.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:56.892
Different genes are expressed in the brain
than in the liver and the eye.

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.557
And we thought: Is it possible

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:07.528
that the mother is somehow
reprogramming the gene of her offspring

00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:09.101
through her behavior?

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.736
And we spent 10 years,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.801
and we found that there is a cascade
of biochemical events

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:18.268
by which the licking and grooming
of the mother, the care of the mother,

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.775
is translated to biochemical signals

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.110
that go into the nucleus and into the DNA

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:26.212
and program it differently.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:31.132
So now the animal can prepare
itself for life:

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.777
Is life going to be harsh?

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:35.563
Is there going to be a lot of food?

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:38.112
Are there going to be a lot of cats
and snakes around,

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.459
or will I live
in an upper-class neighborhood

00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:43.190
where all I have to do
is behave well and proper,

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.349
and that will gain me social acceptance?

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:52.569
And now one can think about
how important that process can be

00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:53.768
for our lives.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.704
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.

00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.340
The DNA is old.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.432
It evolved during evolution.

00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:06.271
But it doesn't tell us
if you are going to be born in Stockholm,

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:09.681
where the days are long in the summer
and short in the winter,

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:11.010
or in Ecuador,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.567
where there's an equal number of hours
for day and night all year round.

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:18.386
And that has such an enormous [effect]
on our physiology.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.725
So what we suggest is,
perhaps what happens early in life,

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:25.916
those signals that come
through the mother,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.455
tell the child what kind of social world
you're going to be living in.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.879
It will be harsh, and you'd better
be anxious and be stressful,

00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:37.026
or it's going to be an easy world,
and you have to be different.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.240
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of light or little light?

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:44.249
Is it going to be a world
with a lot of food or little food?

00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:45.797
If there's no food around,

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.437
you'd better develop your brain to binge
whenever you see a meal,

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:55.217
or store every piece of food
that you have as fat.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.249
So this is good.

00:04:58.273 --> 00:05:00.130
Evolution has selected this

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:05.050
to allow our fixed, old DNA
to function in a dynamic way

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:06.923
in new environments.

00:05:07.377 --> 00:05:09.960
But sometimes things can go wrong;

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:14.568
for example, if you're born
to a poor family

00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:17.521
and the signals are, "You better binge,

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.760
you better eat every piece of food
you're going to encounter."

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:23.036
But now we humans
and our brain have evolved,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.156
have changed evolution even faster.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.544
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.

00:05:28.568 --> 00:05:34.978
And therefore, the preparation
that we had by our mothers

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:37.594
is turning out to be maladaptive.

00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.564
The same preparation that was supposed
to protect us from hunger and famine

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:45.045
is going to cause obesity,

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.039
cardiovascular problems
and metabolic disease.

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:52.138
So this concept that genes
could be marked by our experience,

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:54.463
and especially the early life experience,

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.301
can provide us a unifying explanation

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.668
of both health and disease.

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:02.970
But is true only for rats?

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:05.946
The problem is, we cannot
test this in humans,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.082
because ethically, we cannot administer
child adversity in a random way.

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:13.410
So if a poor child develops
a certain property,

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:17.173
we don't know whether
this is caused by poverty

00:06:17.197 --> 00:06:20.021
or whether poor people have bad genes.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:23.160
So geneticists will try to tell you
that poor people are poor

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:25.240
because their genes make them poor.

00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:27.224
Epigeneticists will tell you

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:31.358
poor people are in a bad environment
or an impoverished environment

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.346
that creates that phenotype,
that property.

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:41.418
So we moved to look
into our cousins, the monkeys.

00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:45.781
My colleague, Stephen Suomi,
has been rearing monkeys

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:46.966
in two different ways:

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.891
randomly separated the monkey
from the mother

00:06:49.915 --> 00:06:52.507
and reared her with a nurse

00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:55.490
and surrogate motherhood conditions.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:58.185
So these monkeys didn't have
a mother; they had a nurse.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.829
And other monkeys were reared
with their normal, natural mothers.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:07.549
And when they were old,
they were completely different animals.

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:10.666
The monkeys that had a mother
did not care about alcohol,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.369
they were not sexually aggressive.

00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:16.160
The monkeys that didn't have a mother
were aggressive, were stressed

00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:17.798
and were alcoholics.

00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:23.964
So we looked at their DNA
early after birth, to see:

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:26.755
Is it possible that the mother is marking?

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:32.137
Is there a signature of the mother
in the DNA of the offspring?

00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.413
These are Day-14 monkeys,

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:38.513
and what you see here is the modern way
by which we study epigenetics.

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:43.200
We can now map those chemical marks,
which we call methylation marks,

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:46.482
on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:48.383
We can map the entire genome.

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:51.474
We can now compare the monkey
that had a mother or not.

00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:53.452
And here's a visual presentation of this.

00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:58.213
What you see is the genes
that got more methylated are red.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:01.251
The genes that got
less methylated are green.

00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:03.759
You can see many genes are changing,

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.497
because not having a mother
is not just one thing --

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.052
it affects the whole way;

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.584
it sends signals about the whole way
your world is going to look

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:13.367
when you become an adult.

00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:15.812
And you can see the two groups of monkeys

00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:18.556
extremely well-separated from each other.

00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:21.521
How early does this develop?

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:24.291
These monkeys already
didn't see their mothers,

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.014
so they had a social experience.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:30.303
Do we sense our social status,
even at the moment of birth?

00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.180
So in this experiment,
we took placentas of monkeys

00:08:35.204 --> 00:08:37.161
that had different social status.

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:43.072
What's interesting about social rank
is that across all living beings,

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:45.714
they will structure
themselves by hierarchy.

00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:48.533
Monkey number one is the boss;

00:08:48.557 --> 00:08:50.895
monkey number four is the peon.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:53.358
You put four monkeys in a cage,

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:56.393
there will always be a boss
and always be a peon.

00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:01.296
And what's interesting
is that the monkey number one

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.752
is much healthier than monkey number four.

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.580
And if you put them in a cage,

00:09:06.604 --> 00:09:11.301
monkey number one will not eat as much.

00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:13.162
Monkey number four will eat [a lot].

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:18.402
And what you see here
in this methylation mapping,

00:09:18.426 --> 00:09:21.201
a dramatic separation at birth

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:23.939
of the animals that had
a high social status

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.637
versus the animals
that did not have a high status.

00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:31.580
So we are born already knowing
the social information,

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.657
and that social information
is not bad or good,

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.100
it just prepares us for life,

00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:40.365
because we have to program
our biology differently

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:43.470
if we are in the high
or the low social status.

00:09:44.326 --> 00:09:46.207
But how can you study this in humans?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.158
We can't do experiments,
we can't administer adversity to humans.

00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:52.775
But God does experiments with humans,

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.087
and it's called natural disasters.

00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:59.371
One of the hardest natural disasters
in Canadian history

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:01.805
happened in my province of Quebec.

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:04.232
It's the ice storm of 1998.

00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:08.056
We lost our entire electrical grid
because of an ice storm

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.077
when the temperatures
were, in the dead of winter in Quebec,

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:13.050
minus 20 to minus 30.

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:15.606
And there were pregnant
mothers during that time.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:22.114
And my colleague Suzanne King
followed the children of these mothers

00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:23.852
for 15 years.

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:28.811
And what happened was,
that as the stress increased --

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:31.443
and here we had objective
measures of stress:

00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:35.905
How long were you without power?
Where did you spend your time?

00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:40.932
Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment
or in some posh country home?

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:43.614
So all of these added up
to a social stress scale,

00:10:43.638 --> 00:10:45.020
and you can ask the question:

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:48.088
How did the children look?

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:50.746
And it appears that as stress increases,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.828
the children develop more autism,

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.391
they develop more metabolic diseases

00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:58.247
and they develop more autoimmune diseases.

00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:01.211
We would map the methylation state,

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:06.773
and again, you see the green genes
becoming red as stress increases,

00:11:06.797 --> 00:11:10.289
the red genes becoming green
as stress increases,

00:11:10.313 --> 00:11:14.863
an entire rearrangement
of the genome in response to stress.

00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:20.651
So if we can program genes,

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:24.648
if we are not just the slaves
of the history of our genes,

00:11:24.672 --> 00:11:27.300
that they could be programmed,
can we deprogram them?

00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:32.675
Because epigenetic causes
can cause diseases like cancer,

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.462
metabolic disease

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:37.589
and mental health diseases.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.813
Let's talk about cocaine addiction.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.631
Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation

00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:48.422
that can lead to death
and to loss of human life.

00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:51.470
We asked the question:

00:11:51.494 --> 00:11:54.733
Can we reprogram the addicted brain

00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:59.681
to make that animal not addicted anymore?

00:12:00.377 --> 00:12:04.657
We used a cocaine addiction model

00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:06.770
that recapitulates what happens in humans.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:09.462
In humans, you're in high school,

00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:11.566
some friends suggest you use some cocaine,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.396
you take cocaine, nothing happens.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.621
Months pass by, something reminds you
of what happened the first time,

00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:19.285
a pusher pushes cocaine,

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:22.141
and you become addicted
and your life has changed.

00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:23.811
In rats, we do the same thing.

00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:25.410
My colleague, Gal Yadid,

00:12:25.434 --> 00:12:28.434
he trains the animals
to get used to cocaine,

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:31.586
then for one month, no cocaine.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.286
Then he reminds them of the party
when they saw the cocaine the first time

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.126
by cue, the colors of the cage
when they saw cocaine.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.802
And they go crazy.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.273
They will press the lever to get cocaine

00:12:42.297 --> 00:12:43.556
until they die.

00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:48.490
We first determined that the difference
between these animals

00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:51.215
is that during that time
when nothing happens,

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:53.011
there's no cocaine around,

00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:54.956
their epigenome is rearranged.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.869
Their genes are re-marked
in a different way,

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:01.635
and when the cue comes,
their genome is ready

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:03.948
to develop this addictive phenotype.

00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:11.335
So we treated these animals with drugs
that either increase DNA methylation,

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:13.583
which was the epigenetic
marker to look at,

00:13:13.607 --> 00:13:17.090
or decrease epigenetic markings.

00:13:17.114 --> 00:13:20.369
And we found that
if we increased methylation,

00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:22.276
these animals go even crazier.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.784
They become more craving for cocaine.

00:13:24.808 --> 00:13:28.234
But if we reduce the DNA methylation,

00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:30.362
the animals are not addicted anymore.

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.005
We have reprogrammed them.

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:35.335
And a fundamental difference
between an epigenetic drug

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:36.665
and any other drug

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:38.861
is that with epigenetic drugs,

00:13:38.885 --> 00:13:43.017
we essentially remove
the signs of experience,

00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.168
and once they're gone,

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:48.213
they will not come back
unless you have the same experience.

00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:49.891
The animal now is reprogrammed.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:54.136
So when we visited the animals
30 days, 60 days later,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.079
which is in human terms
many years of life,

00:13:57.103 --> 00:14:02.409
they were still not addicted --
by a single epigenetic treatment.

00:14:04.472 --> 00:14:07.743
So what did we learn about DNA?

00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:10.892
DNA is not just a sequence of letters;

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.035
it's not just a script.

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:15.430
DNA is a dynamic movie.

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:21.278
Our experiences are being written
into this movie, which is interactive.

00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:24.855
You're, like, watching a movie
of your life, with the DNA,

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:26.661
with your remote control.

00:14:26.685 --> 00:14:30.074
You can remove an actor and add an actor.

00:14:30.872 --> 00:14:36.767
And so you have, in spite
of the deterministic nature of genetics,

00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:40.480
you have control of the way
your genes look,

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:43.774
and this has a tremendous
optimistic message

00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:47.306
for the ability to now encounter
some of the deadly diseases

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.234
like cancer, mental health,

00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:53.186
with a new approach,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.744
looking at them as maladaptation.

00:14:55.768 --> 00:14:58.842
And if we can epigenetically intervene,

00:14:58.866 --> 00:15:02.362
[we can] reverse the movie
by removing an actor

00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:05.243
and setting up a new narrative.

00:15:06.028 --> 00:15:08.525
So what I told you today is,

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:13.641
our DNA is really combined
of two components,

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:15.490
two layers of information.

00:15:16.106 --> 00:15:19.781
One layer of information is old,

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:23.310
evolved from millions
of years of evolution.

00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:26.510
It is fixed and very hard to change.

00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:31.261
The other layer of information
is the epigenetic layer,

00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:35.180
which is open and dynamic

00:15:35.204 --> 00:15:39.796
and sets up a narrative
that is interactive,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:46.608
that allows us to control,
to a large extent, our destiny,

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:51.151
to help the destiny of our children

00:15:51.175 --> 00:15:55.330
and to hopefully conquer disease

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:59.770
and serious health challenges

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:03.405
that have plagued humankind
for a long time.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:06.822
So even though we are determined

00:16:06.846 --> 00:16:08.601
by our genes,

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:11.692
we have a degree of freedom

00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:15.849
that can set up our life
to a life of responsibility.

00:16:15.873 --> 00:16:17.093
Thank you.

00:16:17.117 --> 00:16:22.072
(Applause)
