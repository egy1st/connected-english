00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:05.111
I was 10 years old when I learned
what the word "genocide" meant.

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:08.459
It was 2003,

00:00:08.483 --> 00:00:12.585
and my people were being brutally
attacked because of their race --

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.413
hundreds of thousands murdered,

00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:16.385
millions displaced,

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.708
a nation torn apart at the hands
of its own government.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.389
My mother and father immediately began
speaking out against the crisis.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:25.899
I didn't really understand it,

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:28.769
except for the fact
that it was destroying my parents.

00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:33.104
One day, I walked in on my mother crying,

00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:37.775
and I asked her why
we are burying so many people.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.103
I don't remember the words that she chose

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:45.364
to describe genocide to her
10-year-old daughter,

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:47.017
but I remember the feeling.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:50.796
We felt completely alone,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.738
as if no one could hear us,

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:55.571
as if we were essentially invisible.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.388
This is when I wrote
my first poem about Darfur.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:06.132
I wrote poetry to convince people
to hear and see us,

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.626
and that's how I learned
the thing that changed me.

00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:11.087
It's easy to be seen.

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:16.221
I mean, look at me -- I'm a young
African woman with a scarf around my head,

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:18.408
an American accent on my tongue

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:22.790
and a story that makes even the most
brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.634
But it's hard to convince people
that they deserve to be seen.

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.152
I learned this in my high school
classroom one day,

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:34.051
when my teacher asked me
to give a presentation about Darfur.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.970
I was setting up the projector
when a classmate of mine said,

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.089
"Why do you have to talk about this?

00:01:40.113 --> 00:01:43.163
Can't you think about us
and how it will make us feel?"

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:45.327
(Laughter)

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.415
My 14-year-old self didn't know
what to say to her,

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.301
or how to explain the pain
that I felt in that moment,

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:57.396
and in every moment that we were forced
not to talk about "this."

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.264
Her words took me back to the days
and nights on the ground in Darfur,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.742
where we were forced to remain silent;

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.957
where we didn't speak over morning tea

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.434
because the warplanes overhead
would swallow any and all noise;

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.581
back to the days when we were told

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:16.394
not only that we don't
deserve to be heard

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:19.234
but that we do not have a right to exist.

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.442
And this is where the magic happened,

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.689
in that classroom when all the students
started taking their seats

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:26.982
and I began to speak,

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.745
despite this renewed feeling
that I didn't deserve to be there,

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.209
that I didn't belong there

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.611
or have a right to break the silence.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.794
As I talked,

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:39.461
and my classmates listened,

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:40.955
the fear ebbed away.

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:43.599
My mind became calm,

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:45.300
and I felt safe.

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:49.693
It was the sound of our grieving,

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:52.440
the feel of their arms around me,

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.745
the steady walls that held us together.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.857
It felt nothing like a vacuum.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.077
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:06.131
When someone is standing in front of you,
mind, body and soul,

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.356
saying "Witness me,"

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.194
it's impossible not to become
keenly aware of your own humanity.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.393
This changed everything for me.

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:14.963
It gave me courage.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:18.474
Every day I experience
the power of witness,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.599
and because of that, I am whole.

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:22.105
And so now I ask:

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.495
Will you witness me?

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:27.435
They hand me the microphone

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.760
as my shoulders sink
under the weight of this stress.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:34.301
The woman says,

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.766
"The one millionth refugee
just left South Sudan.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.247
Can you comment?"

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:42.291
I feel my feet rock back and forth
on the heels my mother bought,

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:43.493
begging the question:

00:03:43.517 --> 00:03:46.267
Do we stay, or is it safer
to choose flight?

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.077
My mind echoes the numbers:

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.404
one million gone,

00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:53.050
two million displaced,

00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:55.794
400,000 dead in Darfur.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:57.524
And this lump takes over my throat,

00:03:57.548 --> 00:04:00.170
as if each of those bodies
just found a grave

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.127
right here in my esophagus.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:03.744
Our once country,

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:05.998
all north and south and east and west,

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.940
so restless the Nile couldn't
hold us together,

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:10.823
and you ask me to summarize.

00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.389
They talk about the numbers
as if this isn't still happening,

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:17.630
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:20.548
as if 3,000 aren't still making
their final stand

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.736
at the bottom of the Mediterranean,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.499
as if there aren't entire volumes
full of fact sheets about our genocides,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.377
and now they want me to write one.

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:32.417
Fact:

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:36.145
we never talked over breakfast,

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.884
because the warplanes
would swallow our voices.

00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:40.486
Fact:

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.974
my grandfather didn't want to leave home,

00:04:42.998 --> 00:04:45.027
so he died in a war zone.

00:04:45.647 --> 00:04:46.987
Fact:

00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:50.086
a burning bush without God is just a fire.

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:52.838
I measure the distance between what I know

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.112
and what is safe to say on a microphone.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:58.030
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?

00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:59.447
Do I mention the violence,

00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.151
how it's never as simple
as what you see on TV,

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:05.993
how there are weeks' worth of fear
before the camera is on?

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.274
Do I tell her about our bodies,

00:05:10.298 --> 00:05:11.749
how they are 60 percent water,

00:05:11.773 --> 00:05:13.690
but we still burn like driftwood,

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.596
making fuel of our sacrifice?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.728
Do I tell her the men died first,
mothers forced to watch the slaughter?

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.354
That they came for our children,

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:24.532
scattering them across the continent
until our homes sank?

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:27.685
That even castles sink
at the bite of the bomb?

00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:31.640
Do I talk about the elderly,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.299
our heroes,

00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:35.934
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,

00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.341
how they would march them,

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:39.612
hands raised, rifles at their backs,

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.792
into the fire?

00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:43.086
How their walking sticks
kept the flames alive?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.294
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires
and an audience to swallow.

00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:49.754
Too relentless,

00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:53.637
like the valley that filled
with the putrid smoke of our deaths.

00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.494
Is it better in verse?

00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:58.815
Can a stanza become a burial shroud?

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.670
Will it sting less if I say it softly?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.997
If you don't see me cry,
will you listen better?

00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:05.137
Will the pain leave
when the microphone does?

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:08.355
Why does every word feel
as if I'm saying my last?

00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:12.423
Thirty seconds for the sound bite,

00:06:12.447 --> 00:06:14.547
and now three minutes for the poem.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.384
My tongue goes dry the same way we died,

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:22.600
becoming ash, having never been coal.

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:26.597
I feel my left leg go numb,

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:29.478
and I realize that I locked my knees,

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:31.090
bracing for impact.

00:06:31.737 --> 00:06:34.761
I never wear shoes I can't run in.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.487
Thank you.

00:06:37.988 --> 00:06:44.082
(Applause)

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:49.084
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:52.584
because that's the paradox
that this life has been:

00:06:52.608 --> 00:06:55.608
in the places where I learned
to cry the most,

00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:58.948
I also learned how to smile after.

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.122
So, here goes.

00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:07.691
"You Have a Big Imagination

00:07:08.325 --> 00:07:09.602
or

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:13.262
400,000 Ways to Cry."

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.585
For Zeinab.

00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:18.292
I am a sad girl,

00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:22.010
but my face makes other plans,

00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:26.856
focusing energy on this smile,
so as not to waste it on pain.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.403
The first thing they took was my sleep,

00:07:29.427 --> 00:07:31.745
eyes heavy but wide open,

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:33.793
thinking maybe I missed something,

00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:35.991
maybe the cavalry is still coming.

00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.260
They didn't come,

00:07:37.284 --> 00:07:39.096
so I bought bigger pillows.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.423
(Laughter)

00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:45.212
My grandmother could cure anything

00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:47.823
by talking the life out of it.

00:07:47.847 --> 00:07:51.112
And she said that I could make
a thief in a silo laugh

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.216
in the middle of our raging war.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.662
War makes a broken marriage bed
out of sorrow.

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.379
You want nothing more than to disappear,

00:08:00.403 --> 00:08:04.136
but your heart can't salvage
enough remnants to leave.

00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:06.192
But joy --

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:10.543
joy is the armor we carried across
the borders of our broken homeland.

00:08:12.687 --> 00:08:16.239
A hasty mix of stories and faces

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:19.087
that lasts long after the flavor is gone.

00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:23.928
A muscle memory that overcomes
even the most bitter of times,

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:28.501
my memory is spotted with
days of laughing until I cried,

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.160
or crying until I laughed.

00:08:30.184 --> 00:08:34.153
Laughter and tears are both
involuntary human reactions,

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:37.350
testaments to our capacity for expression.

00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:39.207
So allow me to express

00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.921
that if I make you laugh,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.024
it's usually on purpose.

00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:44.775
And if I make you cry,

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.778
I'll still think you are beautiful.

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:49.962
This is for my cousin Zeinab,

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.710
bedridden on a random afternoon.

00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:58.157
I hadn't seen her since the last time
we were in Sudan together,

00:08:58.181 --> 00:09:02.135
and there I was at her hospital bedside

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:05.517
in a 400-year-old building in France.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.292
Zeinab wanted to hear poems.

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:14.229
Suddenly, English, Arabic
and French were not enough.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:17.640
Every word I knew became empty noise,

00:09:17.664 --> 00:09:19.938
and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it."

00:09:19.962 --> 00:09:21.039
(Laughter)

00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:24.225
And I read her everything that I could,

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:25.585
and we laughed,

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:26.765
and we loved it,

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:30.764
and it was the most important stage
that I've ever stood on,

00:09:30.788 --> 00:09:32.599
surrounded by family,

00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:37.399
by remnants of a people who were given
as a dowry to a relentless war

00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:40.879
but still managed
to make pearls of this life;

00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:44.619
by the ones who taught me
to not only laugh,

00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:47.513
but to live in the face of death;

00:09:47.537 --> 00:09:49.943
who placed their hands across the sky,

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:53.334
measuring the distance to the sun
and saying, "Smile;

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:55.013
I'm gonna meet you there."

00:09:55.798 --> 00:09:57.378
And for Zeinab --

00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:01.693
Zeinab, who taught me love
in a place like France,

00:10:02.424 --> 00:10:06.989
Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar
poems on her deathbed --

00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:10.894
Dilated fibromyalgia.

00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:14.016
Her heart muscles expanded

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:16.539
until they couldn't function.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.063
And she held me,
and she made me feel like gold.

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:22.632
And I said, "Zeinab,

00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:27.001
isn't it strange that your only problem

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:29.909
is that your heart was too big?"

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.619
Thank you.

00:10:33.643 --> 00:10:38.428
(Applause)
