00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:03.296
In the movie "Interstellar,"

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.647
we get an up-close look
at a supermassive black hole.

00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:08.814
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:10.956
the black hole's massive
gravitational pull

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.415
bends light into a ring.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.548
However, this isn't a real photograph,

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:16.358
but a computer graphic rendering --

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.772
an artistic interpretation
of what a black hole might look like.

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:21.567
A hundred years ago,

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.192
Albert Einstein first published
his theory of general relativity.

00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:26.655
In the years since then,

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.652
scientists have provided
a lot of evidence in support of it.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:32.760
But one thing predicted
from this theory, black holes,

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:35.134
still have not been directly observed.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:38.364
Although we have some idea
as to what a black hole might look like,

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.167
we've never actually taken
a picture of one before.

00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:45.470
However, you might be surprised to know
that that may soon change.

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:49.658
We may be seeing our first picture
of a black hole in the next couple years.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.640
Getting this first picture will come down
to an international team of scientists,

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:55.231
an Earth-sized telescope

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.087
and an algorithm that puts together
the final picture.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.639
Although I won't be able to show you
a real picture of a black hole today,

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:04.574
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse
into the effort involved

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.211
in getting that first picture.

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:08.914
My name is Katie Bouman,

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.504
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:13.555
I do research in a computer science lab

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.877
that works on making computers
see through images and video.

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.063
But although I'm not an astronomer,

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:20.372
today I'd like to show you

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:23.299
how I've been able to contribute
to this exciting project.

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:26.154
If you go out past
the bright city lights tonight,

00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:28.614
you may just be lucky enough
to see a stunning view

00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.131
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.617
And if you could zoom past
millions of stars,

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.396
26,000 light-years toward the heart
of the spiraling Milky Way,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.941
we'd eventually reach
a cluster of stars right at the center.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.171
Peering past all the galactic dust
with infrared telescopes,

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.062
astronomers have watched these stars
for over 16 years.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:50.675
But it's what they don't see
that is the most spectacular.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.765
These stars seem to orbit
an invisible object.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.112
By tracking the paths of these stars,

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:57.430
astronomers have concluded

00:01:57.454 --> 00:02:00.583
that the only thing small and heavy
enough to cause this motion

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.575
is a supermassive black hole --

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.777
an object so dense that it sucks up
anything that ventures too close --

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.295
even light.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.380
But what happens if we were
to zoom in even further?

00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:16.137
Is it possible to see something
that, by definition, is impossible to see?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.963
Well, it turns out that if we were
to zoom in at radio wavelengths,

00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:21.669
we'd expect to see a ring of light

00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:24.104
caused by the gravitational
lensing of hot plasma

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:25.957
zipping around the black hole.

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:27.141
In other words,

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.336
the black hole casts a shadow
on this backdrop of bright material,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.202
carving out a sphere of darkness.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:35.565
This bright ring reveals
the black hole's event horizon,

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.989
where the gravitational pull
becomes so great

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:39.639
that not even light can escape.

00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:42.522
Einstein's equations predict
the size and shape of this ring,

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.754
so taking a picture of it
wouldn't only be really cool,

00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:48.396
it would also help to verify
that these equations hold

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.886
in the extreme conditions
around the black hole.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.468
However, this black hole
is so far away from us,

00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:56.590
that from Earth, this ring appears
incredibly small --

00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.204
the same size to us as an orange
on the surface of the moon.

00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.582
That makes taking a picture of it
extremely difficult.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.947
Why is that?

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:09.700
Well, it all comes down
to a simple equation.

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.140
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:13.519
there are fundamental limits

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:16.213
to the smallest objects
that we can possibly see.

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.461
This governing equation says
that in order to see smaller and smaller,

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.072
we need to make our telescope
bigger and bigger.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:26.165
But even with the most powerful
optical telescopes here on Earth,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.608
we can't even get close
to the resolution necessary

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.830
to image on the surface of the moon.

00:03:30.854 --> 00:03:34.471
In fact, here I show one of the highest
resolution images ever taken

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:35.892
of the moon from Earth.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.473
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:42.547
and yet each pixel would contain
over 1.5 million oranges.

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.368
So how big of a telescope do we need

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.157
in order to see an orange
on the surface of the moon

00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:50.395
and, by extension, our black hole?

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.759
Well, it turns out
that by crunching the numbers,

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.393
you can easily calculate
that we would need a telescope

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:56.810
the size of the entire Earth.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:57.858
(Laughter)

00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:00.001
If we could build
this Earth-sized telescope,

00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:02.950
we could just start to make out
that distinctive ring of light

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:05.157
indicative of the black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:08.099
Although this picture wouldn't contain
all the detail we see

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.629
in computer graphic renderings,

00:04:09.653 --> 00:04:11.952
it would allow us to safely get
our first glimpse

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:14.463
of the immediate environment
around a black hole.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.100
However, as you can imagine,

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:19.748
building a single-dish telescope
the size of the Earth is impossible.

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:21.659
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:23.474
"You can't always get what you want,

00:04:23.498 --> 00:04:25.685
but if you try sometimes,
you just might find

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:26.924
you get what you need."

00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:29.412
And by connecting telescopes
from around the world,

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.974
an international collaboration
called the Event Horizon Telescope

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:36.107
is creating a computational telescope
the size of the Earth,

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.668
capable of resolving structure

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.891
on the scale of a black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.302
This network of telescopes is scheduled
to take its very first picture

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.141
of a black hole next year.

00:04:45.165 --> 00:04:48.503
Each telescope in the worldwide
network works together.

00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.239
Linked through the precise timing
of atomic clocks,

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.920
teams of researchers at each
of the sites freeze light

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:56.906
by collecting thousands
of terabytes of data.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.947
This data is then processed in a lab
right here in Massachusetts.

00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:03.765
So how does this even work?

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.192
Remember if we want to see the black hole
in the center of our galaxy,

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:10.198
we need to build this impossibly large
Earth-sized telescope?

00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:12.454
For just a second,
let's pretend we could build

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.320
a telescope the size of the Earth.

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.799
This would be a little bit
like turning the Earth

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:18.570
into a giant spinning disco ball.

00:05:18.594 --> 00:05:20.794
Each individual mirror would collect light

00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:23.415
that we could then combine
together to make a picture.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.100
However, now let's say
we remove most of those mirrors

00:05:26.124 --> 00:05:28.096
so only a few remained.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.997
We could still try to combine
this information together,

00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:33.014
but now there are a lot of holes.

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:37.411
These remaining mirrors represent
the locations where we have telescopes.

00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:41.514
This is an incredibly small number
of measurements to make a picture from.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:45.376
But although we only collect light
at a few telescope locations,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.823
as the Earth rotates, we get to see
other new measurements.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:52.666
In other words, as the disco ball spins,
those mirrors change locations

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.589
and we get to observe
different parts of the image.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:59.631
The imaging algorithms we develop
fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:02.688
in order to reconstruct
the underlying black hole image.

00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:05.348
If we had telescopes located
everywhere on the globe --

00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:07.313
in other words, the entire disco ball --

00:06:07.337 --> 00:06:08.621
this would be trivial.

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:11.967
However, we only see a few samples,
and for that reason,

00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.379
there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.367
that are perfectly consistent
with our telescope measurements.

00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.407
However, not all images are created equal.

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.307
Some of those images look more like
what we think of as images than others.

00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.553
And so, my role in helping to take
the first image of a black hole

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:31.509
is to design algorithms that find
the most reasonable image

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:33.755
that also fits the telescope measurements.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:38.669
Just as a forensic sketch artist
uses limited descriptions

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:42.207
to piece together a picture using
their knowledge of face structure,

00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.546
the imaging algorithms I develop
use our limited telescope data

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.892
to guide us to a picture that also
looks like stuff in our universe.

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:53.567
Using these algorithms,
we're able to piece together pictures

00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.771
from this sparse, noisy data.

00:06:55.795 --> 00:07:00.324
So here I show a sample reconstruction
done using simulated data,

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.281
when we pretend to point our telescopes

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.890
to the black hole
in the center of our galaxy.

00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:09.369
Although this is just a simulation,
reconstruction such as this give us hope

00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:12.846
that we'll soon be able to reliably take
the first image of a black hole

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.465
and from it, determine
the size of its ring.

00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:19.317
Although I'd love to go on
about all the details of this algorithm,

00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.515
luckily for you, I don't have the time.

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.540
But I'd still like
to give you a brief idea

00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:25.866
of how we define
what our universe looks like,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.356
and how we use this to reconstruct
and verify our results.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.876
Since there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.265
that perfectly explain
our telescope measurements,

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.894
we have to choose
between them in some way.

00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:39.756
We do this by ranking the images

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.614
based upon how likely they are
to be the black hole image,

00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:45.120
and then choosing the one
that's most likely.

00:07:45.144 --> 00:07:47.339
So what do I mean by this exactly?

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:49.840
Let's say we were trying to make a model

00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:53.047
that told us how likely an image
were to appear on Facebook.

00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:54.772
We'd probably want the model to say

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:58.353
it's pretty unlikely that someone
would post this noise image on the left,

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.796
and pretty likely that someone
would post a selfie

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.154
like this one on the right.

00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:03.817
The image in the middle is blurry,

00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:06.480
so even though it's more likely
we'd see it on Facebook

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:07.864
compared to the noise image,

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:10.848
it's probably less likely we'd see it
compared to the selfie.

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:13.162
But when it comes to images
from the black hole,

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:16.688
we're posed with a real conundrum:
we've never seen a black hole before.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.003
In that case, what is a likely
black hole image,

00:08:19.027 --> 00:08:21.965
and what should we assume
about the structure of black holes?

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:24.621
We could try to use images
from simulations we've done,

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.175
like the image of the black hole
from "Interstellar,"

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.137
but if we did this,
it could cause some serious problems.

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:33.541
What would happen
if Einstein's theories didn't hold?

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:37.526
We'd still want to reconstruct
an accurate picture of what was going on.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.921
If we bake Einstein's equations
too much into our algorithms,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.700
we'll just end up seeing
what we expect to see.

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:46.000
In other words,
we want to leave the option open

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:48.947
for there being a giant elephant
at the center of our galaxy.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:50.028
(Laughter)

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:53.041
Different types of images have
very distinct features.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.613
We can easily tell the difference
between black hole simulation images

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:58.913
and images we take
every day here on Earth.

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:02.041
We need a way to tell our algorithms
what images look like

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:05.314
without imposing one type
of image's features too much.

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.758
One way we can try to get around this

00:09:07.782 --> 00:09:10.844
is by imposing the features
of different kinds of images

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:14.998
and seeing how the type of image we assume
affects our reconstructions.

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:19.203
If all images' types produce
a very similar-looking image,

00:09:19.227 --> 00:09:21.284
then we can start to become more confident

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:25.481
that the image assumptions we're making
are not biasing this picture that much.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:28.495
This is a little bit like
giving the same description

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:31.515
to three different sketch artists
from all around the world.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:34.399
If they all produce
a very similar-looking face,

00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:36.216
then we can start to become confident

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.856
that they're not imposing their own
cultural biases on the drawings.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.195
One way we can try to impose
different image features

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:45.660
is by using pieces of existing images.

00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:48.374
So we take a large collection of images,

00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:51.116
and we break them down
into their little image patches.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.425
We then can treat each image patch
a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:59.727
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces
to piece together an image

00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.203
that also fits our telescope measurements.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.783
Different types of images have
very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:09.613
So what happens when we take the same data

00:10:09.637 --> 00:10:13.767
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces
to reconstruct the image?

00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:18.557
Let's first start with black hole
image simulation puzzle pieces.

00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:20.172
OK, this looks reasonable.

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:22.890
This looks like what we expect
a black hole to look like.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.107
But did we just get it

00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:27.445
because we just fed it little pieces
of black hole simulation images?

00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:29.349
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces

00:10:29.373 --> 00:10:31.882
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.

00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:35.040
OK, we get a similar-looking image.

00:10:35.064 --> 00:10:37.300
And then how about pieces
from everyday images,

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:40.109
like the images you take
with your own personal camera?

00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:43.427
Great, we see the same image.

00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:46.817
When we get the same image
from all different sets of puzzle pieces,

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:48.887
then we can start to become more confident

00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:50.877
that the image assumptions we're making

00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.822
aren't biasing the final
image we get too much.

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:57.099
Another thing we can do is take
the same set of puzzle pieces,

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.612
such as the ones derived
from everyday images,

00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:03.236
and use them to reconstruct
many different kinds of source images.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.531
So in our simulations,

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:08.330
we pretend a black hole looks like
astronomical non-black hole objects,

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:12.203
as well as everyday images like
the elephant in the center of our galaxy.

00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:15.395
When the results of our algorithms
on the bottom look very similar

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:17.515
to the simulation's truth image on top,

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:20.885
then we can start to become
more confident in our algorithms.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:22.776
And I really want to emphasize here

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.734
that all of these pictures were created

00:11:24.758 --> 00:11:27.694
by piecing together little pieces
of everyday photographs,

00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:29.933
like you'd take with your own
personal camera.

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:33.233
So an image of a black hole
we've never seen before

00:11:33.257 --> 00:11:37.200
may eventually be created by piecing
together pictures we see all the time

00:11:37.224 --> 00:11:39.969
of people, buildings,
trees, cats and dogs.

00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:42.638
Imaging ideas like this
will make it possible for us

00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:45.281
to take our very first pictures
of a black hole,

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.752
and hopefully, verify
those famous theories

00:11:47.776 --> 00:11:50.197
on which scientists rely on a daily basis.

00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:52.829
But of course, getting
imaging ideas like this working

00:11:52.853 --> 00:11:56.175
would never have been possible
without the amazing team of researchers

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:58.086
that I have the privilege to work with.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.273
It still amazes me

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:02.648
that although I began this project
with no background in astrophysics,

00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:05.291
what we have achieved
through this unique collaboration

00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:08.074
could result in the very first
images of a black hole.

00:12:08.098 --> 00:12:10.796
But big projects like
the Event Horizon Telescope

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.634
are successful due to all
the interdisciplinary expertise

00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:15.448
different people bring to the table.

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:17.178
We're a melting pot of astronomers,

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:19.434
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:22.012
This is what will make it soon possible

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:24.889
to achieve something
once thought impossible.

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:27.169
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.289
and help push the boundaries of science,

00:12:29.313 --> 00:12:33.214
even if it may at first seem
as mysterious to you as a black hole.

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.412
Thank you.

00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:36.833
(Applause)
