00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.800
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.216
No one will ever pay you

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440
what you're worth.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.776
They'll only ever pay you

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.181
what they think you're worth.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.000
And you control their thinking,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
not like this,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.856
although that would be cool.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.496
(Laughter)

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.800
That would be really cool.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.640
Instead, like this:

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.136
clearly defining and communicating
your value are essential

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040
to being paid well for your excellence.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.400
Anyone here want to be paid well?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.656
OK, good,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.160
then this talk is for everyone.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.976
It's got universal applicability.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.496
It's true if you're a business owner,
if you're an employee,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.976
if you're a job seeker.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800
It's true if you're a man or a woman.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.136
Now, I approach this today through
the lens of the woman business owner,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.560
because in my work I've observed
that women underprice more so than men.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.736
The gender wage gap is
a well-traveled narrative in this country.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.856
According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.136
a woman employee earns just 83 cents
for every dollar a man earns.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.576
What may surprise you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.216
is that this trend continues
even into the entrepreneurial sphere.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.336
A woman business owner earns just
80 cents for every dollar a man earns.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.696
In my work, I've often heard women express

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.496
that they're uncomfortable
communicating their value,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.680
especially early on in business ownership.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.496
They say things like,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.200
"I don't like to toot my own horn."

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.080
"I'd rather let the work
speak for itself."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.810
"I don't like to sing my own praises."

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.096
I hear very different narratives
in working with male business owners,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320
and I think this difference
is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.096
I'd like to tell you the story
of a consulting firm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.336
that helps their clients
dramatically improve their profitability.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.760
That company is my company.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.056
After my first year in business,
I saw the profit increases

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.560
that my clients were realizing
in working with me,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.040
and I realized that I needed
to reevaluate my pricing.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.000
I was really underpriced
relative to the value I was delivering.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.840
It's hard for me to admit to you,
because I'm a pricing consultant.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.056
(Laughter)

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.296
It's what I do.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.120
I help companies price for value.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.776
But nonetheless, it's what I saw,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.680
and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing,
evaluate my value,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.320
and I did that
by asking key value questions.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.776
What are my clients' needs
and how do I meet them?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
What is my unique skill set that makes me
better qualified to serve my clients?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.360
What do I do that no one else does?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.816
What problems do I solve for clients?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280
What value do I add?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.656
I answered these questions

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.296
and defined the value that my clients
get from working with me,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.176
calculated their return on investment,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.880
and what I saw was
that I needed to double my price,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.176
double it.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.640
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.040
I'm supposed to be the expert in this,
but I'm not cured.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.376
I knew the value was there.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.416
I was convinced the value was there,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.250
and I was still scared out of my wits.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.976
What if nobody would pay me that?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.256
What if clients said, "That's ridiculous.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.480
You're ridiculous."

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.680
Was I really worth that?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.760
Not my work, mind you, but me.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.840
Was I worth that?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.736
I'm the mother of two beautiful
little girls who depend upon me.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.256
I'm a single mom.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.880
What if my business fails?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
What if I fail?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.120
But I know how to take my own medicine,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.576
the medicine that I
prescribe to my clients.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.296
I had done the homework.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.760
I knew the value was there.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.200
So when prospects came,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.376
I prepared the proposals
with the new higher pricing

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.696
and sent them out

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.006
and communicated the value.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.680
How's the story end?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.816
Clients continued to hire me

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.200
and refer me and recommend me,
and I'm still here.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.296
And I share this story

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.760
because doubts and fears
are natural and normal.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.856
But they don't define our value,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.080
and they shouldn't limit
our earning potential.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.336
I'd like to share another story,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.176
about a woman who learned
to communicate her value

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.399
and found her own voice.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.336
She runs a successful
web development company

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.646
and employs several people.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.816
When she first started her firm
and for several years thereafter,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.800
she would say, "I have
a little web design company."

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.376
She'd actually use
those words with clients.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.200
"I have a little web design company."

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.176
In this and in many other small ways,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.096
she was diminishing her company
in the eyes of prospects and clients,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.360
and diminishing herself.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.080
It was really impacting her ability
to earn what she was worth.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.976
I believe her language and her style

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.256
communicated that she didn't believe

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.614
she had much value to offer.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.760
In her own words, she was practically
giving her services away.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.336
And so she began her journey

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.536
to take responsibility
for communicating value to clients

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.760
and changing her message.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.056
One thing I shared with her

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.136
is that it's so important

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.656
to find your own voice,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.736
a voice that's authentic and true to you.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.456
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law
just because she's a great salesperson

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.600
or your neighbor who tells a great joke
if that's not who you are.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.136
Give up this notion
that it's tooting your own horn.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.896
Make it about the other party.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.200
Focus on serving and adding value,
and it won't feel like bragging.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.056
What do you love about what you do?

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.176
What excites you
about the work that you do?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.600
If you connect with that, communicating
your value will come naturally.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.776
So she embraced her natural style,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.960
found her voice and changed her message.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.096
For one thing, she stopped calling herself
a little web design company.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.960
She really found a lot of strength
and power in communicating her message.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.216
She's now charging three times
as much for web design,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.574
and her business is growing.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.536
She told me about a recent meeting

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.736
with a gruff and sometimes
difficult client

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.360
who had called a meeting questioning
progress on search engine optimization.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.696
She said in the old days,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.496
that would have been
a really intimidating meeting for her,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.976
but her mindset was different.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.696
She said, she prepared the information,
sat down with the client,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.496
said this isn't about me,
it's not personal,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.856
it's about the client.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.320
She took them through the data,
through the numbers,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.376
laid out the trends and the progress
in her own voice and in her own way,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.096
but very directly said,
"Here's what we've done for you."

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.960
The client sat up and took notice,
and said, "OK, I got it."

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.896
And she said in describing that meeting,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.760
"I didn't feel scared or panicky

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.760
or small,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.134
which is how I used to feel.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.320
Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.920
I know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'"

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.416
Being properly valued is so important.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.096
You can hear in this story

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.336
that the implications
range far beyond just finances

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.800
into the realm of self-respect
and self-confidence.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.896
Today I've told two stories,
one about defining our value

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.736
and the other about
communicating our value,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.536
and these are the two elements
to realizing our full earning potential.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.760
That's the equation.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.920
And if you're sitting
in the audience today

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.016
and you're not being paid
what you're worth,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080
I'd like to welcome you
into this equation.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.976
Just imagine what life could be like,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.856
how much more we could do,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.976
how much more we could give back,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.536
how much more we could
plan for the future,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.760
how validated and respected we would feel

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.456
if we could earn our full potential,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.800
realize our full value.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.760
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.936
They'll only ever pay you
what they think you're worth,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.480
and you control their thinking.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.616
Thank you.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.960
(Applause)
