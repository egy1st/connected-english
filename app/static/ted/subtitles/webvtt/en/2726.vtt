00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.120
An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.816
told the story of Clyde Murphy,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.720
a black man who was a member
of the Class of 1970.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000
Clyde was a success story.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.376
Clyde spent the next 30 years

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.560
as one of America's
top civil rights lawyers.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.960
He was also a great husband and father.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.816
But despite his success,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.160
personally and professionally,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.360
Clyde's story had a sad ending.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.640
In 2010,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.480
at the age of 62,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.920
Clyde's experience was not unique.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.576
Many of his black classmates from Yale

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.080
also died young.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.440
In fact, the magazine article indicated

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.016
that 41 years after graduation from Yale,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.216
the black members of the Class of 1970

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.496
had a death rate
that was three times higher

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.960
than that of the average class member.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.880
It's stunning.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.760
America has recently awakened

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.856
to a steady drumbeat

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.640
of unarmed black men
being shot by the police.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.160
What is even a bigger story

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.656
is that every seven minutes,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680
a black person dies prematurely
in the United States.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.256
That is over 200 black people

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.416
die every single day

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.240
who would not die if the health
of blacks and whites were equal.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.920
For the last 25 years,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.856
I have been on a mission

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.656
to understand why does race

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.240
matter so profoundly for health.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.536
When I started my career,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.936
many believed that it was simply
about racial differences

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.720
in income and education.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.320
I discovered that while
economic status matters for health,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.096
there is more to the story.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.040
So for example, if we look
at life expectancy at age 25,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.056
at age 25 there's a five-year gap
between blacks and whites.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.016
And the gap by education
for both whites and blacks

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.160
is even larger than the racial gap.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.576
At the same time,
at every level of education,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.840
whites live longer than blacks.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.856
So whites who are high school dropouts

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.576
live 3.4 years longer
than their black counterparts,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.496
and the gap is even larger

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.160
among college graduates.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.216
Most surprising of all,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.616
whites who have graduated from high school

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.336
live longer than blacks
with a college degree

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.600
or more education.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.496
So why does race matter
so profoundly for health?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.560
What else is it
beyond education and income

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.640
that might matter?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.640
In the early 1990s,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680
I was asked to review a new book

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.480
on the health of black America.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.296
I was struck that almost every single one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.576
of its 25 chapters

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.376
said that racism

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.440
was a factor that was hurting
the health of blacks.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.080
All of these researchers

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.880
were stating that racism was a factor
adversely impacting blacks,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.640
but they provided no evidence.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.720
For me, that was not good enough.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.616
A few months later,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.576
I was speaking at a conference
in Washington, DC,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.776
and I said that one
of the priorities for research

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.520
was to document the ways
in which racism affected health.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.416
A white gentleman stood in the audience

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.760
and said that while he agreed
with me that racism was important,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.720
we could never measure racism.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880
"We measure self-esteem," I said.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.616
"There's no reason

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
why we can't measure racism
if we put our minds to it."

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.216
And so I put my mind to it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760
and developed three scales.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.416
The first one captured
major experiences of discrimination,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.696
like being unfairly fired
or being unfairly stopped by the police.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.016
But discrimination also occurs
in more minor and subtle experiences,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120
and so my second scale,
called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.736
captures nine items

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.096
that captures experiences

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.416
like you're treated
with less courtesy than others,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.016
you receive poorer service
than others in restaurants or stores,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.280
or people act as if they're afraid of you.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.056
This scale captures

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.656
ways in which the dignity and the respect

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.616
of people who society does not value

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.000
is chipped away on a daily basis.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.440
Research has found

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.296
that higher levels of discrimination

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.856
are associated with an elevated risk
of a broad range of diseases

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.136
from blood pressure to abdominal obesity

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.816
to breast cancer to heart disease

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.400
and even premature mortality.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.616
Strikingly, some of the effects
are observed at a very young age.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.760
For example, a study of black teens

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.560
found that those who reported higher
levels of discrimination as teenagers

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.800
had higher levels of stress hormones,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.456
of blood pressure

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.200
and of weight at age 20.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.640
However,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.456
the stress of discrimination

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.416
is only one aspect.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.936
Discrimination and racism

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.256
also matters in other
profound ways for health.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.360
For example, there's
discrimination in medical care.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.376
In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.336
asked me to serve on a committee

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.416
that found, concluded
based on the scientific evidence,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.936
that blacks and other minorities

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.840
receive poorer quality care than whites.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.336
This was true for all kinds
of medical treatment,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.720
from the most simple

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.560
to the most technologically sophisticated.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.816
One explanation for this pattern

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.776
was a phenomenon
that's called "implicit bias"

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.096
or "unconscious discrimination."

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.936
Research for decades
by social psychologists

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.456
indicates that if you hold
a negative stereotype

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.536
about a group in your subconscious mind

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.256
and you meet someone from that group,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.576
you will discriminate against that person.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.256
You will treat them differently.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.896
It's an unconscious process.
It's an automatic process.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.096
It is a subtle process, but it's normal

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.000
and it occurs even among
the most well-intentioned individuals.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.296
But the deeper that I delved

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.480
into the health impact of racism,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.080
the more insidious the effects became.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.600
There is institutional discrimination,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.416
which refers to discrimination

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.440
that exists in the processes
of social institutions.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.736
Residential segregation by race,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.736
which has led to blacks and whites living
in very different neighborhood contexts,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.320
is a classic example
of institutional racism.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.056
One of America's best-kept secrets

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.256
is how residential segregation

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.616
is the secret source

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.360
that creates racial inequality
in the United States.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.736
In America, where you live

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.895
determines your access to opportunities

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.216
in education, in employment,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.280
in housing and even
in access to medical care.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.056
One study of the 171 largest
cities in the United States

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.376
concluded that there is not even one city

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.736
where whites live
under equal conditions to blacks,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.696
and that the worst urban contexts
in which whites reside

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.360
is considerably better than the average
context of black communities.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.616
Another study found

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.656
that if you could eliminate statistically

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.336
residential segregation,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.496
you would completely erase
black-white differences in income,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.016
education and unemployment,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.336
and reduce black-white differences
in single motherhood

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.576
by two thirds,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.960
all of that driven by segregation.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.016
I have also learned

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.816
how the negative stereotypes

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.816
and images of blacks in our culture

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.856
literally create and sustain

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.320
both institutional
and individual discrimination.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.600
A group of researchers
have put together a database

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.696
that contains the books,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.736
magazines and articles

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.456
that an average college-educated
American would read over their lifetime.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.296
It allows us to look within this database

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.656
and see how Americans
have seen words paired together

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.176
as they grow up in their society.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.176
So when the word "black"
appears in American culture,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.256
what co-occurs with it?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.696
"Poor,"

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.936
"violent,"

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.296
"religious,"

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.536
"lazy,"

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.776
"cheerful,"

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.536
"dangerous."

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.056
When "white" occurs,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.336
the frequently co-occurring words

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.696
are "wealthy,"

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.976
"progressive,"

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.200
"conventional,"

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.336
"stubborn,"

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.576
"successful,"

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.880
"educated."

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.576
So when a police officer

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.880
overreacts when he sees
an unarmed black male

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.936
and perceives him
to be violent and dangerous,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.520
we are not necessarily dealing
with an inherently bad cop.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.816
We may be simply viewing

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.856
a normal American

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.656
who is reflecting
what he has been exposed to

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.096
as a result of being raised

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.360
in this society.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.400
From my own experience,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.456
I believe that your race

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.480
does not have to be
a determinant of your destiny.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.256
I migrated to the United States

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.360
from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.080
in the late 1970s

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.680
in pursuit of higher education,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.376
and in the last 40 years,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.600
I have done well.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.896
I have had a supportive family,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.200
I have worked hard,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.440
I have done well.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.800
But it took more for me to be successful.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.720
I received a minority fellowship
from the University of Michigan.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.680
Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.336
Without affirmative action,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.040
I would not be here.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.536
But in the last 40 years,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.320
black America has been
less successful than I have.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.016
In 1978, black households
in the United States

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.160
earned 59 cents for every dollar
of income whites earned.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.296
In 2015,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.176
black families still earn 59 cents

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.016
for every dollar of income
that white families receive,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.640
and the racial gaps in wealth
are even more stunning.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.880
For every dollar of wealth
that whites have,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.360
black families have six pennies
and Latinos have seven pennies.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.256
The fact is,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.216
racism

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.576
is producing a truly rigged system

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.840
that is systematically disadvantaging
some racial groups in the United States.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.056
To paraphrase Plato,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.360
there is nothing so unfair

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.200
as the equal treatment of unequal people.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.416
And that's why I am committed

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.960
to working to dismantle racism.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.416
I deeply appreciate the fact

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.696
that I am standing on the shoulders

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.056
of those who have sacrificed
even their lives to open the doors

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.366
that I have walked through.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.176
I want to ensure
that those doors remain open

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.840
and that everyone
can walk through those doors.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.656
Robert Kennedy said,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.216
"Each time a man" --
or woman, I would add --

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.336
"stands up for an ideal

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.936
or acts to improve the lot of others

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.536
or strikes out against injustice,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.096
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.216
and those ripples can build a current

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.200
that can sweep down the mightiest walls
of oppression and resistance."

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.096
I am optimistic today

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.696
because all across America,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.960
I have seen ripples of hope.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.616
The Boston Medical Center

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.360
has added lawyers to the medical team

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.216
so that physicians can improve
the health of their patients

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.520
because the lawyers are addressing
the nonmedical needs their patients have.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.296
Loma Linda University
has built a gateway college

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.136
in nearby San Bernardino

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.456
so that in addition
to delivering medical care,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.296
they can provide job skills

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.976
and job training

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.776
to a predominantly minority,
low-income community members

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.760
so that they will have the skills
they need to get a decent job.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.336
In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.056
the Abecedarian Project has figured out

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.376
how to ensure that they have lowered
the risks for heart disease

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.456
for blacks in their mid-30s

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.496
by providing high-quality day care

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.216
from birth to age five.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.536
In after-school centers
across the United States,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.216
Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.016
is breaking the cycle of incarceration

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.456
by providing high-quality
academic enrichment and mentoring

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.176
to the children of prisoners

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.840
and children who have
fallen behind in school.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.296
In Huntsville, Alabama,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.736
Oakwood University,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.096
a historically black institution,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.416
is showing how we can improve
the health of black adults

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.456
by including a health evaluation

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.616
as a part of freshman orientation

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.616
and giving those students
the tools they need

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.296
to make healthy choices

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.696
and providing them annually
a health transcript

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.560
so they can monitor their progress.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.256
And in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.216
Purpose Built Communities has dismantled
the negative effects of segregation

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.896
by transforming a crime-ridden,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.856
drug-infested public housing project

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.576
into an oasis of mixed-income housing,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.776
of academic performance,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.656
of great community wellness

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.080
and of full employment.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.856
And finally,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.880
there is the Devine solution.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.320
Professor Patricia Devine

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.976
of the University of Wisconsin

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.696
has shown us how we can attack

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.696
our hidden biases head on

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.760
and effectively reduce them.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.456
Each one of us

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.640
can be a ripple of hope.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.696
This work will not always be easy,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.640
but former Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.576
has told us, "We must dissent.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.016
We must dissent from the indifference.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.096
We must dissent from the apathy.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.576
We must dissent from the hatred
and from the mistrust.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.256
We must dissent

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.536
because America can do better,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.376
because America has no choice
but to do better."

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.616
Thank you.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.280
(Applause)
