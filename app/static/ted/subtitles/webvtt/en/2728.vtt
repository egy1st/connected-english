00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.176
So I've been "futuring,"
which is a term I made up --

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.456
(Laughter)

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.696
about three seconds ago.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.536
I've been futuring for about 20 years,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.896
and when I first started,
I would sit down with people,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.816
and say, "Hey,
let's talk 10, 20 years out."

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.616
And they'd say, "Great."

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.136
And I've been seeing that time horizon

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.216
get shorter and shorter

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.856
and shorter,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.256
so much so that I met
with a CEO two months ago

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.656
and I said -- we started
our initial conversation.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.416
He goes, "I love what you do.
I want to talk about the next six months."

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040
(Laughter)

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.176
We have a lot of problems
that we are facing.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920
These are civilizational-scale problems.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.960
The issue though is,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.296
we can't solve them

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.896
using the mental models
that we use right now

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.496
to try and solve these problems.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.176
Yes, a lot of great
technical work is being done,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.576
but there is a problem that
we need to solve for a priori, before,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
if we want to really
move the needle on those big problems.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.896
"Short-termism."

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.376
Right? There's no marches.
There's no bracelets.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.256
There's no petitions that you can sign
to be against short-termism.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.096
I tried to put one up, and no one signed.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.336
It was weird.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.560
(Laughter)

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.296
But it prevents us from doing so much.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.016
Short-termism, for many reasons,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.936
has pervaded every
nook and cranny of our reality.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.536
I just want you to take a second

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.376
and just think about an issue
that you're thinking, working on.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.376
It could be personal, it could be at work

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.456
or it could be
move-the-needle world stuff,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.816
and think about
how far out you tend to think

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.360
about the solution set for that.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.336
Because short-termism prevents the CEO

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.000
from buying really
expensive safety equipment.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.896
It'll hurt the bottom line.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.720
So we get the Deepwater Horizon.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.136
Short-termism prevents teachers

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.696
from spending quality
one-on-one time with their students.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.856
So right now in America,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.720
a high school student
drops out every 26 seconds.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.096
Short-termism prevents Congress --

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.736
sorry if there's anyone
in here from Congress --

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.296
(Laughter)

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.376
or not really that sorry --

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.616
(Laughter)

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.816
from putting money
into a real infrastructure bill.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.456
So what we get
is the I-35W bridge collapse

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.296
over the Mississippi a few years ago,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.520
13 killed.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.520
It wasn't always like this.
We did the Panama Canal.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.856
We pretty much
have eradicated global polio.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.680
We did the transcontinental railroad,
the Marshall Plan.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.360
And it's not just big, physical
infrastructure problems and issues.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.816
Women's suffrage, the right to vote.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.616
But in our short-termist time,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.136
where everything seems to happen right now

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.656
and we can only think out
past the next tweet or timeline post,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.696
we get hyper-reactionary.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.000
So what do we do?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.136
We take people who are fleeing
their war-torn country,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.416
and we go after them.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.056
We take low-level drug offenders,
and we put them away for life.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.456
And then we build McMansions
without even thinking

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.346
about how people are going
to get between them and their job.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.850
It's a quick buck.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.096
Now, the reality is,
for a lot of these problems,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.896
there are some technical fixes,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.136
a lot of them.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.696
I call these technical fixes
sandbag strategies.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.416
So you know there's a storm coming,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.176
the levee is broken,
no one's put any money into it,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.016
you surround your home with sandbags.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.840
And guess what? It works.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.616
Storm goes away,
the water level goes down,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.016
you get rid of the sandbags,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.560
and you do this storm
after storm after storm.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400
And here's the insidious thing.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.016
A sandbag strategy

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.240
can get you reelected.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.696
A sandbag strategy

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.680
can help you make your quarterly numbers.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.216
Now, if we want to move forward

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.016
into a different future
than the one we have right now,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.096
because I don't think we've hit --

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.096
2016 is not peak civilization.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.456
(Laughter)

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.256
There's some more we can do.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.896
But my argument is that unless we shift
our mental models and our mental maps

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.256
on how we think about the short,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.976
it's not going to happen.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.976
So what I've developed
is something called "longpath,"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.736
and it's a practice.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.696
And longpath isn't
a kind of one-and-done exercise.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.416
I'm sure everyone here
at some point has done an off-site

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.536
with a lot of Post-It notes
and whiteboards,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.456
and you do --

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.936
no offense to the consultants
in here who do that --

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.576
and you do a long-term plan,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.040
and then two weeks later,
everyone forgets about it.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.840
Right? Or a week later.
If you're lucky, three months.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.416
It's a practice because
it's not necessarily a thing that you do.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.216
It's a process where you have
to revisit different ways of thinking

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.656
for every major decision
that you're working on.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.160
So I want to go through
those three ways of thinking.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.520
So the first: transgenerational thinking.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.576
I love the philosophers:

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.416
Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640
I was raised on them.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.976
But they all did one thing

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.976
that didn't actually seem like a big deal

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.336
until I really started
kind of looking into this.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.176
And they all took,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.096
as a unit of measure
for their entire reality

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.073
of what it meant to be virtuous and good,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.080
the single lifespan,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.160
from birth to death.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.696
But here's a problem with these issues:

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.136
they stack up on top of us,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.296
because the only way we know
how to do something good in the world

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.536
is if we do it between
our birth and our death.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.256
That's what we're programmed to do.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.736
If you go to the self-help section
in any bookstore,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.000
it's all about you.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.256
Which is great,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.200
unless you're dealing
with some of these major issues.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.400
And so with transgenerational thinking,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.936
which is really kind of
transgenerational ethics,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.576
you're able to expand
how you think about these problems,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.360
what is your role
in helping to solve them.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.880
Now, this isn't something that just has to
be done at the Security Council chamber.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.736
It's something that you can do
in a very kind of personal way.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.176
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky,
my wife and I like to go out to dinner,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.456
and we have three children
under the age of seven.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.909
So you can imagine
it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:21.136
(Laughter)

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.736
So we sit down and literally
all I want to do is just eat and chill,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.416
and my kids have a completely
and totally different idea

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.016
of what we're going to be doing.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.376
And so my first idea

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.296
is my sandbag strategy, right?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.656
It's to go into my pocket
and take out the iPhone

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.136
and give them "Frozen"

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.120
or some other bestselling game thing.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.936
And then I stop

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.536
and I have to kind of put on
this transgenerational thinking cap.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.536
I don't do this in the restaurant,
because it would be bizarre,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.856
but I have to --

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.496
I did it once, and that's how
I learned it was bizarre.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.536
(Laughter)

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.680
And you have to kind of think,
"OK, I can do this."

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.160
But what is this teaching them?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.096
So what does it mean
if I actually bring some paper

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.856
or engage with them in conversation?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.736
It's hard. It's not easy,
and I'm making this very personal.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.136
It's actually more traumatic

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.896
than some of the big issues
that I work on in the world --

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.760
entertaining my kids at dinner.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.696
But what it does is it connects them
here in the present with me,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.976
but it also --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.456
and this is the crux
of transgenerational thinking ethics --

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.776
it sets them up to how they're
going to interact with their kids

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.880
and their kids and their kids.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.040
Second, futures thinking.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.656
When we think about the future,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.920
10, 15 years out,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.778
give me a vision of what the future is.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.656
You don't have to give it to me,
but think in your head.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.816
And what you're probably going to see

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.656
is the dominant cultural lens

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.736
that dominates our thinking
about the future right now:

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.960
technology.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.576
So when we think about the problems,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.776
we always put it through
a technological lens,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.056
a tech-centric, a techno-utopia,
and there's nothing wrong with that,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.376
but it's something that we have to
really think deeply about

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.256
if we're going to move
on these major issues,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.336
because it wasn't always like this. Right?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.000
The ancients had their way of thinking

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.360
about what the future was.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.536
The Church definitely had their idea
of what the future could be,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.496
and you could actually pay your way
into that future. Right?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.456
And luckily for humanity,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.616
we got the scientific revolution.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.296
From there, we got the technology,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.976
but what has happened --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.360
And by the way, this is not a critique.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.696
I love technology.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.655
Everything in my house talks back to me,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.856
from my children
to my speakers to everything.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.696
(Laughter)

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.416
But we've abdicated the future
from the high priests in Rome

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.520
to the high priests of Silicon Valley.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.216
So when we think, well,
how are we going to deal with climate

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.816
or with poverty or homelessness,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.960
our first reaction is to think about it
through a technology lens.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.696
And look, I'm not advocating
that we go to this guy.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.640
I love Joel, don't get me wrong,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.056
but I'm not saying we go to Joel.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.896
What I'm saying is we have to rethink

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.696
our base assumption about
only looking at the future in one way,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.856
only looking at it
through the dominant lens.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.056
Because our problems
are so big and so vast

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.896
that we need to open ourselves up.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.640
So that's why I do everything in my power
not to talk about the future.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.040
I talk about futures.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.656
It opens the conversation again.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.136
So when you're sitting and thinking

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.336
about how do we move forward
on this major issue --

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.896
it could be at home,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.896
it could be at work,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.776
it could be again on the global stage --

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.216
don't cut yourself off from thinking
about something beyond technology as a fix

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.776
because we're more concerned
about technological evolution right now

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.936
than we are about moral evolution.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.976
And unless we fix for that,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.576
we're not going to be able
to get out of short-termism

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.416
and get to where we want to be.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.200
The final, telos thinking.
This comes from the Greek root.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.936
Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.320
And it's really asking one question:

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.320
to what end?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.296
When was the last time
you asked yourself: To what end?

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.120
And when you asked yourself that,
how far out did you go?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.640
Because long isn't long enough anymore.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.456
Three, five years doesn't cut it.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.760
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.016
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,"

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.096
Odysseus had the answer to his "what end."

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.520
It was Ithaca.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.976
It was this bold vision
of what he wanted --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.376
to return to Penelope.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.016
And I can tell you,
because of the work that I'm doing,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.896
but also you know it intuitively --
we have lost our Ithaca.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.456
We have lost our "to what end,"
so we stay on this hamster wheel.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.656
And yes, we're trying
to solve these problems,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.520
but what comes after we solve the problem?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.400
And unless you define what comes after,
people aren't going to move.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.816
The businesses --
this isn't just about business --

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.176
but the businesses that do consistently,
who break out of short-termism

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.216
not surprisingly
are family-run businesses.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.816
They're transgenerational. They're telos.
They think about the futures.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.536
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.
They're 175 years old,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.616
and what's amazing
is that they literally embody

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.456
this kind of longpathian sense
in their brand,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.376
because, by the way,
you never actually own a Patek Philippe,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.976
and I definitely won't --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.016
(Laughter)

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.040
unless somebody wants to just
throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.

00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:37.264
You merely look after it
for the next generation.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.296
So it's important that we remember,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.456
the future, we treat it like a noun.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.736
It's not. It's a verb.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.016
It requires action.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.856
It requires us to push into it.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.816
It's not this thing that washes over us.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.496
It's something that we
actually have total control over.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.416
But in a short-term society,
we end up feeling like we don't.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.776
We feel like we're trapped.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
We can push through that.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.440
Now I'm getting more comfortable

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.440
in the fact that at some point

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.640
in the inevitable future,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.200
I will die.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.336
But because of these new ways
of thinking and doing,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.296
both in the outside world
and also with my family at home,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.456
and what I'm leaving my kids,
I get more comfortable in that fact.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.616
And it's something that a lot of us
are really uncomfortable with,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.840
but I'm telling you,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.256
think it through.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.016
Apply this type of thinking
and you can push yourself past

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.096
what's inevitably
very, very uncomfortable.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.840
And it all begins really
with yourself asking this question:

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.600
What is your longpath?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.776
But I ask you, when you ask yourself that

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.056
now or tonight or behind a steering wheel

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.440
or in the boardroom or the situation room:

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.496
push past the longpath,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.816
quick, oh, what's my longpath
the next three years or five years?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.456
Try and push past your own life if you can

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.856
because it makes you do things
a little bit bigger

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.560
than you thought were possible.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.800
Yes, we have huge,
huge problems out there.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.200
With this process, with this thinking,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.720
I think we can make a difference.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.776
I think you can make a difference,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.416
and I believe in you guys.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.656
Thank you.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.703
(Applause)
