00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.564
Last year, I got a chance to watch
the new "Star Wars" movie,

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:04.743
which was fantastic,

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.204
but one thing kept bugging me.

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.160
I don't know if you noticed this or not.

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:10.264
In this entirely technically
advanced world,

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.450
I did not see a single AED anywhere,

00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:13.882
which was totally shocking --

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.227
almost as shocking
as not knowing what an AED is,

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.644
which you guys do know.

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:18.819
But for those at home,

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.865
an AED is an automated
external defibrillator.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.947
It's the device you use
when your heart goes into cardiac arrest

00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:26.951
to shock it back into a normal rhythm,

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.454
or, as one of the guys I was teaching
a class to referred to it as:

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.028
"The shocky-hearty-box thing."

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:33.709
(Laughter)

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.244
But I really can't blame the Empire,

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.936
since health and safety regulations

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.106
aren't really their first
order of business.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.244
Though, even if we --

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:46.107
I think worse than not having an AED
would be if there was one there,

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.179
but just, no one knew where to find it.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.993
These devices can drastically increase
your chance of survival --

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:54.627
almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:55.673
(Laughter)

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.875
But I'm pretty sure
that stormtrooper is going to be toast,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.084
regardless if we have an AED or not,

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:04.825
since what happens is the chest plate
is going to be quite hard to get off,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.839
and like that tauntaun,

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:10.275
the AED has a very short window of time
at which it's highly effective.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.687
In this case -- basically, we've got
to use it within the first 10 minutes.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.813
The Jedi, on the other hand,
have no problems with their outfits.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:19.569
Those robes open straight up,

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:22.103
you can place the pads
right onto the chest --

00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:24.005
so upper-right-hand side of the chest,

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:25.188
lower left,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:28.360
wait for the unit to determine
if it's a shockable rhythm

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:29.902
and get ready to shock.

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:31.451
But, the Jedi do have a problem.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.117
They have a head appendage issue.

00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:36.336
And so I can be totally clear,
thinking I'm ready to go,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.610
but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.545
and inadvertently shocking myself.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:41.989
(Laughter)

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:46.551
So before you hit that button,
make sure you are clear

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:48.446
and everyone else is clear.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.947
Going back to that stormtrooper:

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.369
If I did get that chest plate off in time,

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:57.223
what would you do if you suddenly found
there was a Wookiee under there,

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:59.755
or possibly two Ewoks?

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.130
(Laughter)

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.427
Well, lucky for us,

00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.651
in the kit there's actually a razor,

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:08.230
and we can use that to shave the chest
on the upper right-hand side

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:09.783
and the lower left.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.497
Wookiees also have another problem.

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:13.949
They have an accessory issue.

00:02:13.973 --> 00:02:16.529
What we want to do is remove these --

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.968
anything between the two pads
we want to remove,

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:22.179
since it can cause
something called "arcing."

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:24.153
For those who don't know what arcing is,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.590
do you remember the Emperor,

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:28.350
when he shoots electricity
out the ends of his fingers --

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:29.387
(Laughter)

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.042
that would be kind of like arcing.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.217
Another thing that --

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:35.570
Oh! By the way, he creates that
by wearing wool socks under his robes.

00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:36.602
(Laughter)

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:39.743
We can also get arcing if we have
an extremely wet chest.

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:43.210
The electricity travels across the surface
instead of through the heart.

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:46.133
We can correct this with the immortal
words of Douglas Adams:

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:48.927
"Don't panic," which most of us
have done today --

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.196
and also always having a towel.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.227
So, good words to go by.

00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.010
The metal bikini -- unfortunately,
this is where panic sets in --

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:58.236
like the modern bra,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.129
we have to make sure we remove,

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:05.024
because this can cause
severe arcing along with burns.

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.401
But unfortunately this opens up an issue

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:10.348
that's almost as controversial
as talking about the prequels.

00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:11.468
(Laughter)

00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:13.378
The mere mention of the word "nipples,"

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.546
and people get into a little
bit of a tizzy.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.021
By the way, that is not a nipple,
that's a cupcake.

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:20.468
(Laughter)

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.365
Chances are, if you do have to use this,

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.327
this is going to be on someone you know.

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.051
And remember, everyone has nipples,

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:28.243
except for Jabba.

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:29.532
(Laughter)

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:31.744
But he does love cupcakes.

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:32.919
Speaking about Jabba,

00:03:32.943 --> 00:03:35.459
if we do have to use an AED on him,

00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:37.325
remember pad placement is the same,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.130
even though he doesn't have nipples.

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:42.277
So it's going to be
upper right-hand side, lower left.

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.473
If we were going through, we're shocking,
getting ready to go --

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:46.844
after we've done the shock,

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:49.914
one of the things we need to do
is remember to do compression.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.570
The preferred method
is 30 compressions and two breaths

00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:56.107
in the center of the chest,
between the nipples,

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.960
pressing down at least two inches,

00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:59.928
no more than two and a half,

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:02.975
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.674
no more than 120.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.782
Unfortunately, due to the size
of Jabba's mouth

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.571
and also what he puts in said mouth,

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:15.028
we may not want to actually
do the mouth-to-mouth part.

00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:17.533
So instead, we can do
compression-only CPR.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.997
The way of remembering
the compression-only part

00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.840
is we can actually use the Imperial March.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:24.781
I would sing it for you --

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:26.246
(Laughter)

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.127
Unfortunately, that would be more
something an interrogation droid would do.

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.373
Yoda.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.052
Small little guy, like a baby.

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:36.511
What we do is basically
treat him like a baby,

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:40.059
in the sense that we're going to place
one pad in the center of the chest

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.234
and one in the back.

00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:42.926
If we place them both in the front,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.520
they can be too close
and cause severe arcing,

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:47.029
so we want to avoid that.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.180
Hopefully, this helped to clarify

00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.506
and put some light
on some of the darker issues

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.750
of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,

00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:55.238
or any universe in total.

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:56.703
I'll leave you with one point.

00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:59.519
Remember, if you do find yourself
dealing with a Wookiee,

00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:01.191
do not shave the entire Wookiee.

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.681
This takes way too much time,

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:04.193
and it only pisses them off.

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:05.225
(Laughter)

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:06.413
Thank you very much.

00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:08.966
(Applause)
