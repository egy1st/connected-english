00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You know, culture was born of the imagination,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
came into being when our species descended

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from our progenitor, Homo erectus,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to every corner of the habitable world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
who clearly had some spark of awareness,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or the development of language,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or some other evolutionary catalyst --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
27,000 years ago,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
our direct ancestors had already,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and for 5,000 years,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
been crawling into the belly of the earth,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they had brought into being

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the great art of the Upper Paleolithic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And you could look at this art and you could, of course,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
see the complex social organization

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of the people who brought it into being.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
something far more sophisticated than hunting magic.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And the way Clayton put it was this way.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He said, "You know, clearly at some point,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
through ritual, to rekindle a connection

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that had been irrevocably lost.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So, he saw this art not as

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And viewed in that light,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it takes on a whole other resonance.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is that as an aesthetic expression,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it lasted for almost 20,000 years.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If these were postcards of nostalgia,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
ours was a very long farewell indeed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And it was also the beginning of our discontent,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because if you wanted to distill all of our experience

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
how and why.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, all people share the same

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
raw, adaptive imperatives.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We all have children.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We all have to deal with the mystery of death,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the world that waits beyond death,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the elders who fall away into their elderly years.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
All of this is part of our common experience,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
biologists have finally proven it to be true,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But the corollary of that is that,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
if we all are brothers and sisters

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and share the same genetic material,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
all human populations share the same raw human genius,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the same intellectual acuity.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And so whether that genius is placed

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
into -- technological wizardry

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
has been the great achievement of the West --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of memory inherent in a myth,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There is no progression of affairs

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in human experience.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and descends down the flanks

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to the so-called primitives of the world.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
All peoples are simply cultural options,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
different visions of life itself.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But what do I mean by different visions of life

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
making for completely different

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
possibilities for existence?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
ever brought into being by the imagination,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that of Polynesia.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
10,000 square kilometers,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I recently sailed on the Hokulea,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
named after the sacred star of Hawaii,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
throughout the South Pacific to make a film

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
about the navigators.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
These are men and women who, even today, can name

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
250 stars in the night sky.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of islands beyond the visible horizon,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
simply by watching the reverberation of waves

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that every island group in the Pacific

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
has its unique refractive pattern

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that can be read with the same perspicacity

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
moving through the canoe at any one point in time,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
distinguishing local wave disturbances

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that can be followed with the same ease

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Indeed, if you took all of the genius

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that allowed us to put a man on the moon

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and applied it to an understanding of the ocean,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
what you would get is Polynesia.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And if we slip from the realm of the sea

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
into the realm of the spirit of the imagination,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Why did we use that word, science?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What is Buddhism but 2,500 years

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of empirical observation

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
as to the nature of mind?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
here once at TED,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"Western science is a major response to minor needs."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
without losing our teeth.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Their billboards are manuals,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to a curious destination,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
accompanied by a great doctor.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And the destination was a single room in a nunnery,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
55 years before.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the essence of the Buddhist path.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It means things happen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The cause of suffering is ignorance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
he meant clinging to the illusion

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that life is static and predictable.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And the fourth and most important, of course,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was the delineation of a contemplative practice

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that not only had the possibility

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of a transformation of the human heart,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that such a transformation was a certainty.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
who had not been out of that room in 55 years,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you did not see a mad woman.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You saw a woman who was more clear

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
than a pool of water in a mountain stream.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you went to the moon, but you did.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in one lifetime, but we do.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And if we move from the realm of the spirit

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to the realm of the physical,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to the sacred geography of Peru --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that literally believe that the Earth is alive,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
responsive to all of their aspirations,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
all of their needs.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And, of course, the human population

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
has its own reciprocal obligations.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I spent 30 years living amongst

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the people of Chinchero

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Once each year, the fastest young boy

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and he becomes a transvestite,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
a waylaka. And for that day,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
he leads all able-bodied men on a run,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
but it's not your ordinary run.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
You start off at 11,500 feet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You run up to 15,000 feet,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
descend 3,000 feet.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And of course, the waylakama spin,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the trajectory of the route,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is marked by holy mounds of Earth,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
but through exhaustion, through sacrifice,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you emerge as a community that has once again

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
only one to finish it.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But these localized rituals become pan-Andean,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and these fantastic festivals,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
60,000 Indians on pilgrimage

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to the end of a dirt road

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
which is dominated by three tongues

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of the great glacier.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
in this wonderful fusion of Christian

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and pre-Columbian ideas.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You place the cross into the ice,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
or sacred mountains of the Inca.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Now, these ideas and these events

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
allow us even to deconstruct iconic places

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
On the contrary, it was completely linked in

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the Inca made in less than a century.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But more importantly, it was linked in

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to the Andean notions of sacred geography.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Take a direct north-south bearing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you find to your astonishment

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that it bisects the intiwatana stone,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
goes to the skyline,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of the Incan empire.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And then beyond Salcantay, of course,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And where does the river rise?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So, 500 years after Columbus,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
these ancient rhythms of landscape

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
are played out in ritual.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now, when I was here at the first TED,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the descendants, survivors of El Dorado.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
These, of course, are the descendants

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
of the ancient Tairona civilization.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
as they are taught the values of their society.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
but the quality of its aspirations.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And I always wanted to go back into these mountains,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to see if this could possibly be true,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Reichel-Dolmatoff.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, literally two weeks ago,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
on what was clearly the most

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
extraordinary trip of my life.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
These really are a people who live and breathe

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the realm of the sacred,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They consume more coca leaves than any human population,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
half a pound per man, per day.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The gourd you see here is --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
everything in their lives is symbolic.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Their central metaphor is a loom.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
as "threads."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
spinning their thoughts into the heavens.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You put the stick in the powder

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
they're burnt limestone --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to empower the coca leaf, to change

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
of cocaine hydrochloride.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
because every stroke of that stick

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that has built up that calcium,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the measure of a man's life,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
has a thought behind it.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that the one side of the field

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is planted like that by the women.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the greatest goldsmiths of South America,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
who in the wake of the conquest,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
retreated into this isolated volcanic massif

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that soars to 20,000 feet

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
above the Caribbean coastal plain.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There are four societies:

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I traveled with the Arhuacos,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and the wonderful thing about this story

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
was that this man, Danilo Villafane --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
if we just jump back here for a second.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I couldn't help but say, "You know,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
you look a lot like an old friend of mine."

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
up and down the mountains."

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And because of that, Danilo invited us

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
to go to the very heart of the world,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Not simply to the flanks of the mountains,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And this man sitting cross-legged

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
is now a grown-up Eugenio,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
a man who I've known since 1974.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And this is one of those initiates.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
but they are kept within the confines

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of the ceremonial men's circle

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
for 18 years.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
This little boy will never step outside

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of the sacred fields

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that surround the men's hut for all that time,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
until he begins his journey of initiation.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
as he is taught the values of society,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
including this notion that their prayers alone

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
maintain the cosmic balance.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Before we could begin our journey,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
there must be nothing between the feet

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and the Earth for a mamo.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And this is actually the place where the Great Mother

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
sent the spindle into the world

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that elevated the mountains and created the homeland

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that they call the heart of the world.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We traveled high into the paramo,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and as we crested the hills,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
we realized that the men were interpreting

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
every single bump on the landscape

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in terms of their own intense religiosity.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And then of course, as we reached our final destination,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
a place called Mamancana,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
we were in for a surprise,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
hidden away until the darkness.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And then, abandoning all our gear,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in a quite dramatic scene.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
is that the minute there was a sense of dangers,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the mamos went into a circle of divination.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And of course, this is a photograph

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
literally taken the night we were in hiding,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
as they divine their route

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to take us out of the mountains.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We were able to, because we had trained

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
people in filmmaking,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
continue with our work,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to the final sacred lakes

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to get the last shots for the film,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And here you see how their sacred landscape

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and yet, still they pray.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And it's an amazing thing to think

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
that this close to Miami,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
praying every day for your well-being.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
They call themselves the Elder Brothers.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
why it is that we do what we do to the Earth.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Now, if we slip to another end of the world,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I was up in the high Arctic

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
to tell a story about global warming,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
inspired in part by

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
the former Vice President's wonderful book.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And what struck me so extraordinary

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
was to be again with the Inuit --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
A people who

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
find a way, with their imagination,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to carve life out of that very frozen.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
A people for whom blood on ice

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
you find to your astonishment

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and stay till July,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it literally comes in now in November

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and stays until March.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So, their entire year has been cut in half.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Now, I want to stress that none of these peoples

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
that I've been quickly talking about here

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
are disappearing worlds.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
These are not dying peoples.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
On the contrary, you know,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
you discover that the world is not flat.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The world remains a rich tapestry.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
These myriad voices of humanity

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
are not failed attempts at being new,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
failed attempts at being modern.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
They're unique facets of the human imagination.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
They're unique answers to a fundamental question:

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
what does it mean to be human and alive?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And when asked that question, they respond

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
with 6,000 different voices.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
for dealing with the challenges that will confront us

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
in the ensuing millennia.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Our industrial society is scarcely

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
300 years old.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that we have all of the answers

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
for all of the questions that will confront us

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
in the ensuing millennia.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
They are unique answers to that fundamental question:

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
what does it mean to be human and alive?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
taking with it not only plants and animals,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
but the legacy of humanity's brilliance.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Right now, as we sit here in this room,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
fully half aren't being taught to children.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So, you're living through a time

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
when virtually half of humanity's intellectual,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
social and spiritual legacy

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
is being allowed to slip away.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
This does not have to happen.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
quaint and colorful and destined to fade away

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
as if by natural law.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
In every case, these are dynamic, living peoples

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That's actually an optimistic observation,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
because it suggests that if human beings

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
are the agents of cultural destruction,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
we can also be, and must be,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
the facilitators of cultural survival.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Thank you very much.
