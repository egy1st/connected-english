00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.096
Twenty years ago,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.056
when I was a barrister
and human rights lawyer

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.055
in full-time legal practice in London,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.256
and the highest court in the land

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.696
still convened, some would say
by an accident of history,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.040
in this building here,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.896
I met a young man
who had just quit his job

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349
in the British Foreign Office.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.216
When I asked him, "Why did you leave,"

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440
he told me this story.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.216
He had gone to his boss
one morning and said,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.360
"Let's do something
about human rights abuses in China."

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.176
And his boss had replied,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.896
"We can't do anything
about human rights abuses in China

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.520
because we have
trade relations with China."

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.256
So my friend went away
with his tail between his legs,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.440
and six months later,
he returned again to his boss,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.856
and he said this time,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.376
"Let's do something
about human rights in Burma,"

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.600
as it was then called.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.536
His boss once again paused

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.576
and said, "Oh, but we can't
do anything about human rights in Burma

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.256
because we don't have
any trade relations with Burma."

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.936
(Laughter)

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.056
This was the moment
he knew he had to leave.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440
It wasn't just the hypocrisy
that got to him.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.416
It was the unwillingness of his government

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.056
to engage in conflict
with other governments,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.856
in tense discussions,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.680
all the while, innocent people
were being harmed.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.136
We are constantly told

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.240
that conflict is bad

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960
that compromise is good;

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.296
that conflict is bad

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440
but consensus is good;

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.336
that conflict is bad

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.920
and collaboration is good.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.336
But in my view,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.736
that's far too simple
a vision of the world.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.656
We cannot know

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.736
whether conflict is bad

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.576
unless we know who is fighting,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.736
why they are fighting

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.616
and how they are fighting.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.096
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.800
if they harm people
who are not at the table,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.015
people who are vulnerable, disempowered,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.320
people whom we have
an obligation to protect.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.536
Now, you might be
somewhat skeptical of a lawyer

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.736
arguing about the benefits of conflict

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.376
and creating problems for compromise,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.216
but I did also qualify as a mediator,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.520
and these days, I spend my time
giving talks about ethics for free.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.240
So as my bank manager likes to remind me,
I'm downwardly mobile.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.296
But if you accept my argument,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.496
it should change not just the way
we lead our personal lives,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.840
which I wish to put
to one side for the moment,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.376
but it will change the way
we think about major problems

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.160
of public health and the environment.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.640
Let me explain.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.736
Every middle schooler
in the United States,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.416
my 12-year-old daughter included,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.296
learns that there are
three branches of government,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.160
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial branch.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.256
James Madison wrote,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.296
"If there is any principle
more sacred in our Constitution,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.056
and indeed in any free constitution,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.576
than any other,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.096
it is that which separates

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.240
the legislative, the executive
and the judicial powers."

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.336
Now, the framers were not just concerned

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.456
about the concentration
and exercise of power.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.480
They also understood
the perils of influence.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.536
Judges cannot determine
the constitutionality of laws

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.336
if they participate in making those laws,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.296
nor can they hold the other branches
of government accountable

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.256
if they collaborate with them

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.440
or enter into close
relationships with them.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.376
The Constitution is,
as one famous scholar put it,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.640
"an invitation to struggle."

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.016
And we the people are served

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.440
when those branches do, indeed,
struggle with each other.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.856
Now, we recognize
the importance of struggle

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.776
not just in the public sector

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.176
between our branches of government.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.536
We also know it too in the private sector,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.160
in relationships among corporations.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.376
Let's imagine that two American airlines
get together and agree

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.576
that they will not drop the price

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.960
of their economy class airfares
below 250 dollars a ticket.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.456
That is collaboration,
some would say collusion,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.816
not competition,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.656
and we the people are harmed

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.520
because we pay more for our tickets.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.096
Imagine similarly
two airlines were to say,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.136
"Look, Airline A, we'll take
the route from LA to Chicago,"

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.336
and Airline B says, "We'll take
the route from Chicago to DC,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.816
and we won't compete."

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.456
Once again, that's collaboration
or collusion instead of competition,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.200
and we the people are harmed.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.336
So we understand
the importance of struggle

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.600
when it comes to relationships
between branches of government,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.776
the public sector.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.216
We also understand
the importance of conflict

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.576
when it comes to relationships
among corporations,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.256
the private sector.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.856
But where we have forgotten it

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.296
is in the relationships
between the public and the private.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.016
And governments all over the world
are collaborating with industry

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.816
to solve problems of public health
and the environment,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.816
often collaborating
with the very corporations

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.680
that are creating or exacerbating
the problems they are trying to solve.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.656
We are told that these relationships

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.360
are a win-win.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.520
But what if someone is losing out?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600
Let me give you some examples.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.336
A United Nations agency
decided to address a serious problem:

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.960
poor sanitation in schools in rural India.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.256
They did so not just in collaboration
with national and local governments

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.776
but also with a television company

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.640
and with a major
multinational soda company.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.776
In exchange for less
than one million dollars,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.176
that corporation received the benefits
of a months-long promotional campaign

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.376
including a 12-hour telethon

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.600
all using the company's logo
and color scheme.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.560
This was an arrangement

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.016
which was totally understandable

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.976
from the corporation's point of view.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.536
It enhances the reputation of the company

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.080
and it creates brand loyalty
for its products.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.976
But in my view,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.696
this is profoundly problematic
for the intergovernmental agency,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.880
an agency that has a mission
to promote sustainable living.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.016
By increasing consumption
of sugar-sweetened beverages

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.336
made from scarce local water supplies
and drunk out of plastic bottles

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.376
in a country that is already
grappling with obesity,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.816
this is neither sustainable
from a public health

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.736
nor an environmental point of view.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.096
And in order to solve
one public health problem,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.416
the agency is sowing the seeds

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.640
of another.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.776
This is just one example
of dozens I discovered

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.896
in researching a book on the relationships
between government and industry.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.696
I could also have told you
about the initiatives in parks

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.336
in London and throughout Britain,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.760
involving the same company,
promoting exercise,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.416
or indeed of the British government
creating voluntary pledges

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.616
in partnership with industry

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.376
instead of regulating industry.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.056
These collaborations or partnerships
have become the paradigm in public health,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.136
and once again, they make sense
from the point of view of industry.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.776
It allows them to frame
public health problems and their solutions

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.936
in ways that are least threatening to,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.816
most consonant with
their commercial interests.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.416
So obesity becomes a problem

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.696
of individual decision-making,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.775
of personal behavior,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.976
personal responsibility
and lack of physical activity.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.096
It is not a problem,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.535
when framed this way,

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.176
of a multinational food system
involving major corporations.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.856
And again, I don't blame industry.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.296
Industry naturally engages
in strategies of influence

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.800
to promote its commercial interests.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.816
But governments have a responsibility

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.896
to develop counterstrategies

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.736
to protect us

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.440
and the common good.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.720
The mistake that governments are making

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.056
when they collaborate in this way

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.416
with industry

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.016
is that they conflate

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.856
the common good

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.080
with common ground.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.856
When you collaborate with industry,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.696
you necessarily put off the table

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.296
things that might promote the common good
to which industry will not agree.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.096
Industry will not agree
to increased regulation

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.296
unless it believes this will
stave off even more regulation

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.560
or perhaps knock some competitors
out of the market.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.256
Nor can companies agree
to do certain things,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.256
for example raise the prices
of their unhealthy products,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.416
because that would violate
competition law,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.640
as we've established.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.776
So our governments should not confound

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.256
the common good and common ground,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.520
especially when common ground
means reaching agreement with industry.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.216
I want to give you another example,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.376
moving from high-profile collaboration

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.896
to something that is below ground

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.176
both literally and figuratively:

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.800
the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.016
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.256
not knowing the mineral rights
have been sold.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.080
This is before the fracking boom.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.376
You build your dream home on that plot,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.016
and shortly afterwards,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.440
you discover that a gas company
is building a well pad on your land.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.440
That was the plight
of the Hallowich family.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.016
Within a very short period of time,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.256
they began to complain of headaches,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.496
of sore throats, of itchy eyes,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.336
in addition to the interference
of the noise, vibration

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.496
and the bright lights
from the flaring of natural gas.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.840
They were very vocal in their criticisms,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.320
and then they fell silent.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.656
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
where this image appeared,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.536
and one other newspaper,
we discovered why they fell silent.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.256
The newspapers went to the court and said,
"What happened to the Hallowiches?"

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.656
And it turned out the Hallowiches
had made a secret settlement

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.576
with the gas operators, and it was
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.856
The gas company said,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.296
you can have a six-figure sum

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.456
to move elsewhere
and start your lives again,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.696
but in return

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.576
you must promise not to speak
of your experience with our company,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.176
not to speak of your
experience with fracking,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.920
not to speak about the health consequences

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.600
that might have been revealed
by a medical examination.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.536
Now, I do not blame
the Hallowiches for accepting

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.376
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.616
and starting their lives elsewhere.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.856
And one can understand

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.856
why the company would wish
to silence a squeaky wheel.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.656
What I want to point the finger at
is the legal and regulatory system,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.136
a system in which there are
networks of agreements

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.056
just like this one

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.640
which serve to silence people
and seal off data points

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.216
from public health experts
and epidemiologists,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.856
a system in which regulators

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.016
will even refrain
from issuing a violation notice

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.416
in the event of pollution

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.576
if the landowner and the gas company

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.176
agree to settle.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.136
This is a system which isn't just
bad from a public health point of view;

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.456
it exposes hazards to local families

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.680
who remain in the dark.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.696
Now, I have given you two examples
not because they are isolated examples.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.216
They are examples of a systemic problem.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.616
I could share some counterexamples,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.616
the case for example
of the public official

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.736
who sues the pharmaceutical company

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.376
for concealing the fact

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.976
that its antidepressant increases
suicidal thoughts in adolescents.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.896
I can tell you about the regulator
who went after the food company

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.656
for exaggerating the purported
health benefits of its yogurt.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.136
And I can tell you about the legislator

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.456
who despite heavy lobbying
directed at both sides of the aisle

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.400
pushes for environmental protections.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.896
These are isolated examples,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.096
but they are beacons of light
in the darkness,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.800
and they can show us the way.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.280
I began by suggesting that sometimes
we need to engage in conflict.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.016
Governments should tussle with,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.840
struggle with, at times engage
in direct conflict with corporations.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.216
This is not because governments
are inherently good

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.496
and corporations are inherently evil.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.520
Each is capable of good or ill.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.160
But corporations understandably
act to promote their commercial interests,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.136
and they do so either sometimes
undermining or promoting the common good.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.136
But it is the responsibility
of governments

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.376
to protect and promote the common good.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.096
And we should insist

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.520
that they fight to do so.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.296
This is because governments

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.720
are the guardians

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.800
of public health;

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.656
governments are the guardians

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.536
of the environment;

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.376
and it is governments

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.696
that are guardians

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.080
of these essential parts
of our common good.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.896
Thank you.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:43.148
(Applause)
