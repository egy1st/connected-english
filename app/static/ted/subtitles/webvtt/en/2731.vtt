00:00:00.995 --> 00:00:04.944
In the next six minutes
that you will listen to me,

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:07.505
the world will have lost three mothers

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.370
while delivering their babies:

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.477
one, because of a severe complication;

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:17.019
second, because she will be a teenager

00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:20.828
and her body will not
be prepared for birth;

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:26.858
but the third, only because of lack
of access to basic clean tools

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:28.612
at the time of childbirth.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:31.959
She will not be alone.

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.658
Over one million mothers and babies
die every single year

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.211
in the developing world,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.979
only because of lack of access
to basic cleanliness

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.210
while giving birth to their babies.

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.259
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:49.451
in India in 2008,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.148
when after a day of meeting women
and listening to their needs,

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:56.099
I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.785
As a mother, I was very curious
on how she delivered babies in her house.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.512
After a deep and engaging
conversation with her

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:08.882
on how she considered it a profound
calling to do what she was doing,

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.946
I asked her a parting question:

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.822
Do you have the tools that you need
to deliver the babies?

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.628
I got to see her tool.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.736
"This is what I use to separate
the mother and the baby," she said.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.620
Unsure of how to react, I held this
agricultural tool in my hand in shock.

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.710
I took a picture of this,
hugged her and walked away.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.609
My mind was flooded with reflections
of my own infection

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:39.665
that I had to struggle with
for a year past childbirth

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.239
despite having access
to the best medical care,

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:45.645
and memories of my conversation
with my father,

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.834
who had lost his mom to childbirth,

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.300
on how he thought his life
would be so different

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:52.919
if she would have been
just next to him growing up.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:57.569
As a product developer,
I started my process of research.

00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:00.768
I was very excited to find
that there was a product out there

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:02.193
called the Clean Birth Kit.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.284
But I just couldn't buy one for months.

00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:09.537
They were only assembled
based on availability of funding.

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:14.416
Finally, when I got my hands on one,
I was in shock again.

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:18.629
I would never use these tools
to deliver my baby, I thought.

00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:21.564
But to confirm my instincts,
I went back to the women,

00:02:21.588 --> 00:02:24.726
some of whom had the experience
of using this product.

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:28.494
Lo and behold, they had
the same reaction and more.

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:31.532
The women said they would rather
deliver on a floor

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:34.154
than on a plastic sheet
that smeared blood all over.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:37.593
They were absolutely right --
it would cause more infection.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:40.626
The thread provided was a highway
to bacterial infection

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.349
through the baby's umbilical cord,

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:45.217
and the blade used was the kind
that men used for shaving,

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.798
and they did not want it
anywhere close to them.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.583
There was no incentive for anybody
to redesign this product,

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:53.518
because it was based on charity.

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:56.282
The women were never
consulted in this process.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.383
And to my surprise, the need
was not only in homes

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:02.736
but also in institutional settings
with high-volume births.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.970
Situations in remote areas
were even more daunting.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.205
This had to change.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.491
I made this my area of focus.

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:13.646
I started the design process
by collecting feedback,

00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:16.006
developing prototypes

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.838
and engaging with various stakeholders
researching global protocols.

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:22.948
With every single prototype,
we went back to the women

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:25.438
to ensure that we had a product for them.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.775
What I learned through this process
was that these women,

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.238
despite their extreme poverty,

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.639
placed great value
on their health and well-being.

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:35.113
They were absolutely not poor in mind.

00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:38.138
As with all of us, they would appreciate
a well-designed product

00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:39.594
developed for their needs.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.747
After many iterations
working with experts,

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:44.252
medical health professionals

00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:46.111
and the women themselves,

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:49.503
I should say it was not
an easy process at all,

00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:52.433
but we had a simple and beautiful design.

00:03:53.687 --> 00:03:58.457
For a dollar more than what
the existing product was offered for,

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.232
at three dollars, we were able
to deliver "janma,"

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:03.133
a clean birth kit in a purse.

00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.878
Janma, meaning "birth," contained
a blood-absorbing sheet

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:08.629
for the woman to give birth on,

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:12.658
a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,
a bar of soap, a pair of gloves

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:15.345
and the first cloth
to wipe the baby clean.

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.557
All this came packaged
in a beautiful purse

00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.796
that was given to the mother
as a gift after all her hard work,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.103
that she carried home with pride
as a symbol of prosperity.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.323
One woman reacted to this gift.

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:31.167
She said, "Is this really mine?
Can I keep it?"

00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:34.704
The other one said,
"Will you give me a different color

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:36.207
when I have my next baby?"

00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:37.985
(Laughter)

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.926
Better yet, a woman expressed
that this was the first purse

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.027
that she had ever owned in her life.

00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.835
The kit, aside from its symbolism
and its simplicity,

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:49.171
is designed to follow
globally recommended medical protocol

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:54.074
and serves as a behavior-change tool
to follow steps one after the other.

00:04:54.098 --> 00:04:57.741
It can not only be used in homes,
but also in institutional settings.

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:02.605
To date, our kit has impacted
over 600,000 mothers and babies

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:03.837
around the world.

00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:07.644
It's a humbling experience
to watch these numbers grow,

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.339
and I cannot wait until
we reach a hundred million.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.753
But women's health issues do not end here.

00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:19.787
There are thousands of simple issues
that require low-cost interventions.

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.727
We have facts to prove
that if we invest in women and girls

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.160
and provide them with better
health and well-being,

00:05:25.184 --> 00:05:30.195
they will deliver healthier and wealthier
and prosperous communities.

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.203
We have to start by bringing simplicity
and dignity to women's health issues:

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:37.299
from reducing maternal mortality,
to breaking taboos,

00:05:37.323 --> 00:05:40.833
to empowering women
to take control of their own lives.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:42.611
This is my dream.

00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:47.773
But it is not possible to achieve it
without engaging men and women alike

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.238
from around the world --

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:50.988
yes, all of you.

00:05:52.773 --> 00:05:55.835
I recently heard this lyric
by Leonard Cohen:

00:05:56.962 --> 00:06:00.185
"Ring the bells that still can ring.

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.349
Forget your perfect offering.

00:06:03.373 --> 00:06:06.274
There is a crack in everything.

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:09.046
That's how the light gets in."

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.517
This is my bit of light.

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:13.185
But we need more light.

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:16.653
In fact, we need huge spotlights
placed in the world of women's health

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:18.975
if we need a better tomorrow.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:23.492
We should never forget that women
are at the center of a sustainable world,

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.043
and we do not exist without them.

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.226
Thank you.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.325
(Applause)
