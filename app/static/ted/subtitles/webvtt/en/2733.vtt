00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:05.136
Two months ago, my kids and I
huddled around a cell phone

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.456
watching the live stream
of the Game Awards,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.376
one of the video game
industry's biggest nights.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.056
They announced the nominees
for the Game for Impact,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.136
an award that's given
to a thought-provoking video game

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.936
with a profound prosocial
message or meaning.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.656
They opened the envelope

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.896
and they read the title of our video game.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.296
An award ...

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.136
for impact.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.856
It was almost funny, actually,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.536
because I always thought
that winning an award like that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.216
would have this huge impact on my life,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.000
but I found that the opposite is true.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.256
The big nights,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.376
the accomplishments --

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.976
they fade.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.416
But the hardest nights of my life
have stuck with me,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.936
impacting who I am

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.680
and what I do.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.560
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed
with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.416
And before that year was finished,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.976
doctors sat my husband and I down

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.256
and let us know
that his tumor had returned

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.000
despite the most aggressive chemotherapy
and radiation that they could offer him.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.976
On that terrible night,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.096
after learning that Joel
had perhaps four months to live,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.976
I cuddled up with
my two older sons in bed --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.536
they were five and three at the time --

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.656
and I never really knew
how much they understood,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.376
so I started telling them a bedtime story.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.256
I told them about this
very brave knight named Joel

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.920
and his adventure fighting
a terrible dragon called cancer.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.776
Every night, I told them
more of the story,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.816
but I never let the story end.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.976
I was just building up a context
that they could understand

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.256
and hoping that our prayers
would be answered

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.776
and I would never
have to tell them that that knight,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.096
who had fought so bravely,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.656
was done fighting

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.960
and could rest now, forever.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.936
Fortunately, I never did have to
finish that bedtime story.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.136
My children outgrew it.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.256
Joel responded better than anyone expected
to palliative treatment,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.936
and so instead of months,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.240
we spent years learning how to love
our dying child with all of our hearts.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.616
Learning to recognize
that shameful feeling

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.536
of holding back just a little love

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.416
to try to spare ourselves
just a little pain

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.000
somewhere further down the road.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.216
We pushed past that self-preservation

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.160
because Joel was worth loving
even if that love could crush us.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640
And that lesson of intense
vulnerability has changed me ...

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.000
more than any award ever could.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.736
We started living like Joel could live,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.000
and we began developing a video game
called "That Dragon, Cancer."

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040
It was the story of Joel.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.256
It was the story of hope
in the shadow of death.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.800
It was the story of faith

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.096
and doubt,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.240
and the realization that a wrestle
with doubt is a part of faith --

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.680
maybe the biggest part of it.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.016
It was a story that began as a miracle

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.480
and ended as a memorial.

[That Dragon, Cancer]

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.400
(Music)

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.456
When you play "That Dragon, Cancer,"

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.456
you're transformed
into a witness of Joel's life,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.656
exploring an emotional landscape,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.216
clicking to discover more of what
we as a family felt and experienced.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.776
It feels a little bit
like analyzing interactive poetry

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.136
because every game mechanic is a metaphor,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.536
and so the more the player asks themselves

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.496
what we as designers
were trying to express and why,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.880
the richer the experience becomes.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.416
We took that vulnerability
that Joel taught us,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.000
and we encoded the game with it.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.096
Players expect their video games
to offer them branching narrative

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.656
so that every decision
that they make feels important

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.376
and can change the outcome of the game.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.176
We subverted that principle
of game design,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.576
collapsing the choices in on the player

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.376
so that they discover for themselves

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600
that there is nothing that they can do
that will change the outcome for Joel.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.056
And they feel that discovery
as deeply and desperately as we felt it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.256
on nights when we held Joel
in our arms praying for hours,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.720
stubbornly holding out hope for a grace
that we could not create for ourselves.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.320
We'd all prefer to win,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.520
but when you discover that you can't win,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.200
what do you value instead?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.816
I never planned to write video games,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.376
but these moments
that really change our lives,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.520
they often come as the result
of our hardship -- and not our glory.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.616
When we thought that Joel could live,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.776
I left the game designing to my husband.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.856
I chimed in here and there

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.856
with a scene or two and some suggestions.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.520
But after the night that Joel died,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.896
the passion,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.096
the possibility of sharing Joel's life
through our video game --

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.256
it was something that I couldn't resist.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.616
I started writing more,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.056
I sat in on our team's design meetings,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.176
I added more ideas
and I helped direct scenes.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.096
And I discovered that creating
a video game is telling a story,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.856
but with an entirely new vocabulary.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.416
All the same elements of imagination
and symbolism are there,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.056
but they're just partnered
with player agency

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.080
and system responsiveness.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.736
It's challenging work.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.776
I have to think
in a totally new way to do it,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.456
but I love it.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.080
And I wouldn't have known
that without Joel.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.576
Maybe you're a little surprised

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.680
by our choice to share our story
of terminal cancer through a video game.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.696
Perhaps you're even thinking
like so many people before you:

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.040
cancer is not a game.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.456
Well, tell that
to any pediatric cancer parent

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.416
that's ever taken an exam glove
and blown it up into a balloon,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.176
or transformed a syringe
into a rocket ship,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.336
or let their child ride their IV pole
through the hospital halls

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.040
like it was a race car.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.976
Because when you have children,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.840
everything is a game.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.576
And when your young child
experiences something traumatic,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.656
you work even harder to make sure
that their life feels like a game

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.560
because children naturally
explore their worlds through play.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.256
While cancer can steal
many things from a family,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.880
it shouldn't steal play.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.456
If you're listening to me
and you're trying to imagine this family

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.696
that revolves entirely
around a dying child,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.736
and you can't imagine joy
as part of that picture,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.816
then we were right
to share our story with you,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.496
because that season of our life was hard.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.296
Unspeakably hard at times,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.400
but it was also pure hope,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.616
deep love

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.520
and joy like I have never
experienced since.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.856
Our video game was our attempt
to share that world

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.096
with people who hadn't
experienced it before,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.920
because we never could imagine
that world until it became ours.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.240
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.616
It will never be a blockbuster.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.376
People have to prepare themselves
to invest emotionally

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.920
in a story that they know
will break their hearts.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.216
But when our hearts break,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.560
they heal a little differently.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.895
My broken heart has been healing
with a new and a deeper compassion --

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.856
a desire to sit with people in their pain,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.895
to hear their stories
and try to help tell them

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.880
so that they know that they're seen.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.936
On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer"
won the Game for Impact Award,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.376
we cheered,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.576
we smiled and we talked about Joel

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.856
and the impact he had on our life --

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.976
on all of those hard and hopeful nights
that we shared with him

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.456
when he changed our hearts

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:07.360
and taught us so much more
about life and love and faith and purpose.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.320
That award will never mean as much to me
as even a single photograph of my son,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.856
but it does represent all of the people
who his life has impacted,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.976
people I'll never meet.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.360
They write me emails sometimes.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.336
They tell me that they miss Joel,
even though they never met him.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.000
They describe the tears
that they've shed for my son,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.736
and it makes my burden of grief
just a little bit lighter

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.856
knowing that it's shared
with a 10-year-old

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.896
watching a YouTube playthrough,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.136
or a doctor playing on his airplane
with a smartphone,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.600
or a professor introducing Joel
to her first-year philosophy students.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.400
We made a video game that's hard to play.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.216
But that feels just right to me,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.816
because the hardest moments of our lives

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.320
change us more than any goal
we could ever accomplish.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.976
Tragedy has shifted my heart

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.040
more than any dream
I could ever see come true.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.336
Thank you.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.598
(Applause)
