00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:05.155
The school of architecture
that I studied at some 30 years ago

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:09.018
happened to be across the street
from the wonderful art gallery

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.230
designed by the great
architect Louis Kahn.

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:16.870
I love the building,
and I used to visit it quite often.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:18.425
One day,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.544
I saw the security guard run his hand
across the concrete wall.

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:26.764
And it was the way he did it,

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.522
the expression on his face --

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.057
something touched me.

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:36.606
I could see that the security guard
was moved by the building

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:41.829
and that architecture has that capacity

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:43.015
to move you.

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.956
I could see it, and I remember thinking,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.205
"Wow. How does architecture do that?"

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.531
At school, I was learning to design,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.617
but here -- here was
a reaction of the heart.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.243
And it touched me to the core.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:09.976
You know, you aspire for beauty,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.422
for sensuousness, for atmosphere,
the emotional response.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.262
That's the realm of the ineffable

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.057
and the immeasurable.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.223
And that's what you live for:

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:26.607
a chance to try.

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:31.335
So in 2003, there was
an open call for designs

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.481
for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.

00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:36.503
This was the first temple
in all of South America.

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:38.411
It's a continental temple,

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.614
a hugely important milestone
for the Bahá'í community,

00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:45.870
because this would be the last
of the continental temples

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:49.450
and would open the door
for national and local temples to be built

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:50.799
around the world.

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:54.373
And the brief was deceptively simple

00:01:54.397 --> 00:01:58.046
and unique in the annals of religion:

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:04.044
a circular room, nine sides,
nine entrances, nine paths,

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:11.518
allowing you to come to the temple
from all directions,

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:14.476
nine symbolizing completeness,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.740
perfection.

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:20.040
No pulpit, no sermons,

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:22.400
as there are no clergy
in the Bahá'í faith.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.115
And in a world which is putting up walls,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.587
the design needed to express in form

00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:31.896
the very opposite.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.027
It had to be open, welcoming

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.595
to people of all faiths,
walks of life, backgrounds,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.604
or no faith at all;

00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:47.632
a new form of sacred space

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.670
with no pattern

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:53.178
or models to draw from.

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:58.186
It was like designing one of the first
churches for Christianity

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.892
or one of the first mosques for Islam.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.635
So we live in a secular world.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.622
How do you design sacred space today?

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:18.839
And how do you even define
what's sacred today?

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:25.977
I stumbled across this beautiful quote
from the Bahá'í writings,

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.809
and it speaks to prayer.

00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:31.541
It says that if you reach out in prayer,

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:36.675
and if your prayer is answered --
which is already very interesting --

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:41.129
that the pillars of your heart
will become ashine.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:44.996
And I loved this idea
of the inner and the outer,

00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:51.298
like when you see someone
and you say, "That person is radiant."

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:57.211
And I was thinking, "My gosh,
how could we make something

00:03:57.235 --> 00:03:59.298
architectural out of that,

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:03.527
where you create a building

00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.339
and it becomes alive with light?

00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:11.540
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,
it becomes alive.

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:13.706
And I drew this sketch,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.091
something with two layers, translucent

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:19.872
with structure in between capturing light.

00:04:20.646 --> 00:04:26.607
Maybe a pure form,
a single form of emanation

00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:29.052
that you could imagine

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:32.580
would be all dome

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:36.075
and everything we kept making
was looking too much like an egg.

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.709
(Laughter)

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:38.956
A blob.

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:40.924
So you search.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.032
You all know this crazy search,
letting the process take you,

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.680
and you live for the surprises.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.930
And I remember quite by accident

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:55.326
I saw this little video
of a plant moving in light,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.013
and it made me think of movement,

00:04:59.037 --> 00:05:00.209
reach,

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.549
this idea that the temple
could have reach,

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:04.345
like this reach for the divine.

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:07.232
You can imagine also

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:12.151
that movement within a circle
could mean movement and stillness,

00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:14.166
like the cosmos,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.834
something you see in many places.

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.287
(Laughter)

00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:23.626
But rotation was not enough,

00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:27.032
because we needed a form.

00:05:27.056 --> 00:05:29.322
In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:34.208
the temples being as perfect
as is humanly possible,

00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:36.809
and we kept thinking,
well, what is perfection?

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:41.177
And I remember I stumbled into this image
of this Japanese basket

00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:45.202
and thinking our Western notions
of perfection need to be challenged,

00:05:45.226 --> 00:05:49.949
that this wonderful silhouette
of this basket, this wonkiness,

00:05:49.973 --> 00:05:55.621
and that it has the kind of dimple
of what you might imagine a shoulder

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.152
or the cheekbone,

00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:59.309
and that kind of organic form.

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.866
And so we drew and made models,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.105
these lines that merge at the top,

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.467
soft lines,

00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:11.428
which became like drapery

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:14.949
and translucent veils and folding,

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:19.063
and the idea of not only
folding but torquing --

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.091
you remember the plant
and the way it was reaching.

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:26.556
And this started to become
an interesting form,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.267
carving the base, making the entrances.

00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:32.099
And then we ended up with this.

00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:35.720
This is this temple with two layers,

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:38.237
nine luminous veils,

00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:39.736
embodied light,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.707
soft-flowing lines

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:43.894
like luminescent drapery.

00:06:43.918 --> 00:06:47.987
180 submissions
were received from 80 countries,

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.018
and this was selected.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:55.229
So we went to the next stage
of how to build it.

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.885
We had submitted alabaster.

00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:02.645
But alabaster was too soft,

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.145
and we were experimenting,
many experiments with materials,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.535
trying to think how we could have
this kind of shimmer,

00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:13.616
and we ended up with borosilicate.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.216
And borosilicate glass,
as you know, is very strong,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.466
and if you break borosilicate rods
just so and melt them

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.794
at just the right temperature,

00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:26.586
we ended up with this new material,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.824
this new cast glass which took us
about two years to make.

00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:34.061
And it had this quality that we loved,

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:36.124
this idea of the embodied light,

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:41.486
but on the inside, we wanted
something with a soft light,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.121
like the inner lining of a jacket.

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:48.043
On the outside you have protection,
but on the inside you touch it.

00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:54.620
So we found this tiny vein
in a huge quarry in Portugal

00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:57.927
with this beautiful stone,

00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:02.961
which the owner had kept
for seven generations in his family,

00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:05.846
waiting for the right project,
if you can believe it.

00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:09.969
Look at this material, it's beautiful.

00:08:09.993 --> 00:08:13.331
And the way it lights up;
it has that translucent quality.

00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:16.616
So here you see the structure.

00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:18.753
It lets the light through.

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.171
And looking down,

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:25.467
the nine wings are bound,

00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:29.031
structurally but symbolically strong,

00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:31.430
a great symbol of unity:

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:35.626
pure geometry, a perfect circle,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.036
30 meters in section and in plan,

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.840
perfectly symmetrical,

00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:44.841
like the idea of sacredness and geometry.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.148
And here you see the building going up,

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:51.459
2,000 steel nodes,

00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:54.506
9,000 pieces of steel,

00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:57.985
7,800 stone pieces,

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:02.541
10,000 cast glass pieces,
all individual shapes,

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:05.598
the entire superstructure all described,

00:09:05.622 --> 00:09:10.113
engineered, fabricated
with aerospace technology,

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:13.324
prefabricated machine to machine,

00:09:13.348 --> 00:09:15.212
robotically,

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:17.513
a huge team effort, you can imagine,

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:19.481
of literally hundreds,

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:24.233
and within three percent
of our $30 million budget

00:09:24.257 --> 00:09:26.540
set in 2006.

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:28.211
(Applause)

00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:35.173
Nine wings bound together

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:37.368
forming a nine-pointed star,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.570
and the star shape moving in space,

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:44.845
tracking the sun.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.202
So here it is.

00:09:57.226 --> 00:09:58.999
Audience: Wow!

00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:05.123
(Applause)

00:10:07.986 --> 00:10:12.402
Hopefully, a befitting response
to that beautiful quote,

00:10:13.386 --> 00:10:15.522
"a prayer answered,"

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:17.876
open in all directions,

00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:21.166
capturing the blue light of dawn,

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:25.916
tent-like white light of day,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.858
the gold light of the afternoon,

00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:31.664
and of course, at night, the reversal:

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:34.800
sensuous,

00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:39.844
catching the light in all kinds
of mysterious ways.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:47.194
And the site: it's interesting;
14 years ago when we made the submission,

00:10:47.218 --> 00:10:49.328
we showed the temple
set against the Andes.

00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:52.062
We didn't have the Andes as our site,

00:10:53.705 --> 00:10:56.741
but after nine years, that's exactly
where we ended up,

00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:01.991
the lines of the temple set against
nothing but pure nature,

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:07.154
and you turn around and you get
nothing but the city below you,

00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:11.866
and inside, a view in all directions,

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.736
radiating gardens

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.703
from each of the alcoves,

00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:21.031
radiating paths.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.744
Last October, the opening ceremonies --

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:31.851
a beautiful, sacred event,

00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:35.658
5,000 people from 80 countries,

00:11:35.682 --> 00:11:39.595
a continuous river of visitors,

00:11:39.619 --> 00:11:43.089
indigenous people
from all over South America,

00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:45.728
some who had never left their villages.

00:11:47.283 --> 00:11:51.781
And of course, that this temple
belongs to people,

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:57.240
the collective, of many cultures
and walks of life,

00:11:57.264 --> 00:11:58.680
many beliefs,

00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:03.317
and for me, what's most important
is what it feels like on the inside;

00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:06.167
that it feel intimate,

00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.946
sacred,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.350
and that everyone is welcome.

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:14.993
And if even a few who come

00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:18.730
have the same reaction
as that security guard,

00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:24.274
then it truly would be their temple.

00:12:25.242 --> 00:12:26.843
