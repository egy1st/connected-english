00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.416
I would like to tell you
about the most embarrassing thing

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.240
that has ever happened to me in my years
of working as a palliative care physician.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.576
This happened a couple of years ago.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.536
I was asked as a consultant
to see a woman in her 70s --

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.456
retired English professor
who had pancreatic cancer.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000
I was asked to see her because
she had pain, nausea, vomiting ...

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.576
When I went to see her,
we talked about those symptoms

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.496
and in the course of that consultation,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.240
she asked me whether I thought
that medical marijuana might help her.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.656
I thought back to everything

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.016
that I had learned in medical school
about medical marijuana,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.880
which didn't take very long
because I had learned absolutely nothing.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.616
And so I told her that as far as I knew,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.096
medical marijuana
had no benefits whatsoever.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.776
And she smiled and nodded and reached
into the handbag next to the bed,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.816
and pulled out a stack of about a dozen
randomized controlled trials

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.495
showing that medical
marijuana has benefits

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.776
for symptoms like nausea
and pain and anxiety.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.696
She handed me those articles and said,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.000
"Maybe you should read these
before offering an opinion ...

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.096
doctor."

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.336
(Laughter)

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.216
So I did.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.736
That night I read all of those articles
and found a bunch more.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.896
When I came to see her the next morning,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.656
I had to admit that it looks like
there is some evidence

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.016
that marijuana can offer medical benefits

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.696
and I suggested that if she
really was interested,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.240
she should try it.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.000
You know what she said?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.600
This 73-year-old,
retired English professor?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.616
She said, "I did try it
about six months ago.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.176
It was amazing.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.896
I've been using it every day since.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.176
It's the best drug I've discovered.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.336
I don't know why it took me 73 years
to discover this stuff. It's amazing."

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.376
(Laughter)

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.536
That was the moment at which I realized

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.816
I needed to learn something
about medical marijuana

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.696
because what I was prepared for
in medical school

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160
bore no relationship to reality.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.456
So I started reading more articles,
I started talking to researchers,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.896
I started talking to doctors,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
and most importantly,
I started listening to patients.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.136
I ended up writing a book
based on those conversations,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.256
and that book really revolved
around three surprises --

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.256
surprises to me, anyway.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.816
One I already alluded to --

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.976
that there really are some benefits
to medical marijuana.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.736
Those benefits may not be
as huge or as stunning

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.696
as some of the most avid proponents
of medical marijuana

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.936
would have us believe,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.240
but they are real.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.336
Surprise number two:

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.056
medical marijuana does have some risks.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.096
Those risks may not be
as huge and as scary

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.456
as some of the opponents of medical
marijuana would have us believe,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.880
but they are real risks, nonetheless.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.896
But it was the third surprise
that was most ...

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.376
surprising.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.416
And that is that a lot
of the patients I talked with

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.136
who've turned to medical
marijuana for help,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.096
weren't turning to medical marijuana
because of its benefits

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.136
or the balance of risks and benefits,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.536
or because they thought
it was a wonder drug,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.296
but because it gave them
control over their illness.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.496
It let them manage their health

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.696
in a way that was productive and efficient

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.280
and effective and comfortable for them.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.176
To show you what I mean,
let me tell you about another patient.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.376
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.776
She looked though
like she was in her late 60s.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.056
She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
for the last 20 years,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.496
her hands were gnarled by arthritis,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.256
her spine was crooked,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.896
she had to rely
on a wheelchair to get around.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.536
She looked weak and frail,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.816
and I guess physically she probably was,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.816
but emotionally,
cognitively, psychologically,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.520
she was among the toughest
people I've ever met.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.736
And when I sat down next to her

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.416
in a medical marijuana dispensary
in Northern California

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.856
to ask her about why she turned
to medical marijuana,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.856
what it did for her and how it helped her,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.616
she started out by telling me things

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.656
that I had heard
from many patients before.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.656
It helped with her anxiety;

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.056
it helped with her pain;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.136
when her pain was better,
she slept better.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.616
And I'd heard all that before.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.296
But then she said something
that I'd never heard before,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.096
and that is that it gave her
control over her life

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.816
and over her health.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.936
She could use it when she wanted,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.376
in the way that she wanted,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.816
at the dose and frequency
that worked for her.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.216
And if it didn't work for her,
then she could make changes.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.656
Everything was up to her.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.376
The most important thing she said

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.056
was she didn't need
anybody else's permission --

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.696
not a clinic appointment,
not a doctor's prescription,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.256
not a pharmacist's order.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.176
It was all up to her.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.000
She was in control.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.216
And if that seems like a little thing
for somebody with chronic illness,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.440
it's not -- not at all.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.456
When we face a chronic serious illness,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.776
whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
or lupus or cancer or diabetes,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.296
or cirrhosis,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.136
we lose control.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.696
And note what I said: "when," not "if."

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.976
All of us at some point in our lives
will face a chronic serious illness

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.496
that causes us to lose control.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.376
We'll see our function decline,
some of us will see our cognition decline,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.056
we'll be no longer able
to care for ourselves,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.336
to do the things that we want to do.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.456
Our bodies will betray us,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.056
and in that process, we'll lose control.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.976
And that's scary.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.136
Not just scary -- that's frightening,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.736
it's terrifying.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.416
When I talk to my patients,
my palliative care patients,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.336
many of whom are facing illnesses
that will end their lives,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.416
they have a lot of be frightened of --

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.056
pain, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, fatigue,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.376
their impending mortality.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.976
But what scares them
more than anything else

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.176
is this possibility that at some point,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.376
tomorrow or a month from now,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.536
they're going to lose
control of their health,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.176
of their lives,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.576
of their healthcare,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.096
and they're going to become
dependent on others,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.000
and that's terrifying.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.256
So it's no wonder really
that patients like Robin,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.296
who I just told you about,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.736
who I met in that clinic,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.296
turn to medical marijuana

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.776
to try to claw back
some semblance of control.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.056
How do they do it though?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.736
How do these medical
marijuana dispensaries --

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.736
like the one where I met Robin --

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.456
how do they give patients like Robin
back the sort of control that they need?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.776
And how do they do it

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.856
in a way that mainstream
medical hospitals and clinics,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.216
at least for Robin, weren't able to?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.056
What's their secret?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.736
So I decided to find out.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.896
I went to a seedy clinic
in Venice Beach in California

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.216
and got a recommendation

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.776
that would allow me
to be a medical marijuana patient.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.816
I got a letter of recommendation
that would let me buy medical marijuana.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.656
I got that recommendation illegally,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.736
because I'm not
a resident of California --

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.976
I should note that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.736
I should also note, for the record,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.296
that I never used that letter
of recommendation to make a purchase,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.016
and to all of you DEA agents out there --

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.256
(Laughter)

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.856
love the work that you're doing,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.096
keep it up.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.136
(Laughter)

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.589
Even though it didn't let me
make a purchase though,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.296
that letter was priceless
because it let me be a patient.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.536
It let me experience
what patients like Robin experience

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.576
when they go to a medical
marijuana dispensary.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.016
And what I experienced --

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.256
what they experience every day,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.736
hundreds of thousands
of people like Robin --

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.976
was really amazing.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.256
I walked into the clinic,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.936
and from the moment that I entered
many of these clinics and dispensaries,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.536
I felt like that dispensary, that clinic,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.200
was there for me.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.776
There were questions
at the outset about who I am,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.656
what kind of work I do,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.736
what my goals are in looking
for a medical marijuana prescription,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.576
or product,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.976
what my goals are,
what my preferences are,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.256
what my hopes are,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.936
how do I think, how do I hope
this might help me,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.576
what am I afraid of.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.176
These are the sorts of questions

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.656
that patients like Robin
get asked all the time.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.616
These are the sorts of questions
that make me confident

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.296
that the person I'm talking with
really has my best interests at heart

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.000
and wants to get to know me.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.896
The second thing I learned
in those clinics

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.096
is the availability of education.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.936
Education from the folks
behind the counter,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.176
but also education
from folks in the waiting room.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.736
People I met were more than happy,
as I was sitting next to them --

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.015
people like Robin --

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.816
to tell me about who they are,
why they use medical marijuana,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.056
what helps them, how it helps them,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.016
and to give me advice and suggestions.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.680
Those waiting rooms really are
a hive of interaction, advice and support.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.896
And third, the folks behind the counter.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.296
I was amazed at how willing
those people were

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.856
to spend sometimes an hour or more
talking me through the nuances

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.936
of this strain versus that strain,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.656
smoking versus vaporizing,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.416
edibles versus tinctures --

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.200
all, remember, without me
making any purchase whatsoever.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.056
Think about the last time
you went to any hospital or clinic

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.880
and the last time anybody spent an hour
explaining those sorts of things to you.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.296
The fact that patients like Robin
are going to these clinics,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.896
are going to these dispensaries

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.856
and getting that sort
of personalized attention

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.736
and education and service,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.176
really should be a wake-up call
to the healthcare system.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.176
People like Robin are turning away
from mainstream medicine,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.536
turning to medical marijuana dispensaries

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.440
because those dispensaries
are giving them what they need.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.016
If that's a wake-up call
to the medical establishment,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.816
it's a wake-up call that many
of my colleagues are either not hearing

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.560
or not wanting to hear.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.976
When I talk to my colleagues,
physicians in particular,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.336
about medical marijuana,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.016
they say, "Oh, we need more evidence.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.000
We need more research into benefits,
we need more evidence about risks."

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.456
And you know what? They're right.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.736
They're absolutely right.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.936
We do need much more evidence
about the benefits of medical marijuana.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.336
We also need to ask the federal government
to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.920
or to deschedule it entirely
to make that research possible.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.416
We also need more research
into medical marijuana's risks.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.816
Medical marijuana's risks --

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.216
we know a lot about
the risks of recreational use,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.136
we know next to nothing
about the risks of medical marijuana.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.736
So we absolutely do need research,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.096
but to say that we need research

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.176
and not that we need
to make any changes now

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.136
is to miss the point entirely.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.736
People like Robin
aren't seeking out medical marijuana

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.616
because they think it's a wonder drug,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.376
or because they think
it's entirely risk-free.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.056
They seek it out because the context
in which it's delivered and administered

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.296
and used,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.856
gives them the sort of control
they need over their lives.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.920
And that's a wake-up call
we really need to pay attention to.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.776
The good news though is that
there are lessons we can learn today

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.776
from those medical marijuana dispensaries.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.936
And those are lessons
we really should learn.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.696
These are often small,
mom-and-pop operations

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.176
run by people with no medical training.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.776
And while it's embarrassing to think

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.856
that many of these clinics
and dispensaries are providing services

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.256
and support and meeting patients' needs

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.296
in ways that billion-dollar
healthcare systems aren't --

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.016
we should be embarrassed by that --

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.936
but we can also learn from that.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.096
And there are probably
three lessons at least

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.360
that we can learn
from those small dispensaries.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.496
One: we need to find ways
to give patients more control

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.536
in small but important ways.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.616
How to interact with healthcare providers,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.816
when to interact
with healthcare providers,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.456
how to use medications
in ways that work for them.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.696
In my own practice,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.456
I've gotten much more
creative and flexible

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.616
in supporting my patients
in using drugs safely

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.136
to manage their symptoms --

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.536
with the emphasis on safely.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.016
Many of the drugs I prescribe
are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.816
which can be dangerous if overused.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.056
But here's the point.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.136
They can be dangerous if they're overused,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.056
but they can also be ineffective
if they're not used in a way

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.736
that's consistent with
what patients want and need.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.976
So that flexibility,
if it's delivered safely,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.096
can be extraordinarily valuable
for patients and their families.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.336
That's number one.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.376
Number two: education.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.616
Huge opportunities

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.096
to learn from some of the tricks
of those medical marijuana dispensaries

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.496
to provide more education

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.256
that doesn't require
a lot of physician time necessarily,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.016
or any physician time,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.416
but opportunities to learn
about what medications we're using

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.656
and why,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.736
prognoses, trajectories of illness,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.976
and most importantly,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.736
opportunities for patients
to learn from each other.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.696
How can we replicate what goes on

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.136
in those clinic and medical
dispensary waiting rooms?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.840
How patients learn from each other,
how people share with each other.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.856
And last but not least,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.936
putting patients first the way
those medical marijuana dispensaries do,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.776
making patients feel
legitimately like what they want,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.056
what they need,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.776
is why, as healthcare providers,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.000
we're here.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.856
Asking patients about their hopes,
their fears, their goals and preferences.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.336
As a palliative care provider,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.880
I ask all my patients what they're
hoping for and what they're afraid of.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.816
But here's the thing.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.336
Patients shouldn't have to wait
until they're chronically seriously ill,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.176
often near the end of life,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.496
they shouldn't have to wait
until they're seeing a physician like me

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.256
before somebody asks them,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.536
"What are you hoping for?"

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.816
"What are you afraid of?"

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.240
That should be baked into the way
that healthcare is delivered.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.176
We can do this --

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.416
we really can.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.816
Medical marijuana dispensaries
and clinics all across the country

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.616
are figuring this out.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.896
They're figuring this out

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.416
in ways that larger, more mainstream
health systems are years behind.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.816
But we can learn from them,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.376
and we have to learn from them.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.736
All we have to do is swallow our pride --

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.416
put aside the thought for a minute

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.936
that because we have
lots of letters after our name,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.216
because we're experts,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.376
because we're chief medical officers
of a large healthcare system,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.576
we know all there is to know
about how to meet patients' needs.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.016
We need to swallow our pride.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.096
We need to go visit
a few medical marijuana dispensaries.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.096
We need to figure out what they're doing.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.696
We need to figure out
why so many patients like Robin

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.896
are leaving our mainstream medical clinics

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.296
and going to these medical
marijuana dispensaries instead.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.416
We need to figure out
what their tricks are,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.696
what their tools are,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.856
and we need to learn from them.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.136
If we do,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.096
and I think we can,
and I absolutely think we have to,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.520
we can guarantee all of our patients
will have a much better experience.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.256
Thank you.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.680
(Applause)
