WEBVTT

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.840
Space, the final frontier.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.336
I first heard these words
when I was just six years old,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.616
and I was completely inspired.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.016
I wanted to explore strange new worlds.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.536
I wanted to seek out new life.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760
I wanted to see everything
that the universe had to offer.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.536
And those dreams, those words,
they took me on a journey,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.016
a journey of discovery,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.216
through school, through university,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.680
to do a PhD and finally
to become a professional astronomer.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.936
Now, I learned two amazing things,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.496
one slightly unfortunate,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.576
when I was doing my PhD.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.016
I learned that the reality was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.200
I wouldn't be piloting
a starship anytime soon.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.056
But I also learned that the universe
is strange, wonderful and vast,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.880
actually too vast
to be explored by spaceship.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.080
And so I turned my attention
to astronomy, to using telescopes.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.616
Now, I show you before you
an image of the night sky.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.560
You might see it anywhere in the world.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.000
And all of these stars are part
of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.256
Now, if you were to go
to a darker part of the sky,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.816
a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.256
you might see the center
of our Milky Way galaxy

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
spread out before you,
hundreds of billions of stars.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.416
And it's a very beautiful image.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.776
It's colorful.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.416
And again, this is just
a local corner of our universe.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.736
You can see there's
a sort of strange dark dust across it.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.736
Now, that is local dust

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.416
that's obscuring the light of the stars.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.016
But we can do a pretty good job.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.496
Just with our own eyes, we can explore
our little corner of the universe.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.856
It's possible to do better.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.640
You can use wonderful telescopes
like the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.376
Now, astronomers
have put together this image.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.296
It's called the Hubble Deep Field,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.656
and they've spent hundreds of hours
observing just a tiny patch of the sky

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.080
no larger than your thumbnail
held at arm's length.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.776
And in this image

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.456
you can see thousands of galaxies,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.936
and we know that there must be
hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.336
in the entire universe,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.016
some like our own and some very different.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.696
So you think, OK, well,
I can continue this journey.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.416
This is easy. I can just
use a very powerful telescope

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.240
and just look at the sky, no problem.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.976
It's actually really missing out
if we just do that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.736
Now, that's because
everything I've talked about so far

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.656
is just using the visible spectrum,
just the thing that your eyes can see,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.096
and that's a tiny slice,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480
a tiny, tiny slice
of what the universe has to offer us.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.896
Now, there's also two very important
problems with using visible light.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.656
Not only are we missing out
on all the other processes

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.856
that are emitting other kinds of light,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.296
but there's two issues.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.696
Now, the first is that dust
that I mentioned earlier.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.656
The dust stops the visible light
from getting to us.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.376
So as we look deeper
into the universe, we see less light.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.960
The dust stops it getting to us.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.936
But there's a really strange problem
with using visible light

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.920
in order to try and explore the universe.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.896
Now take a break for a minute.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.600
Say you're standing on a corner,
a busy street corner.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.576
There's cars going by.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.000
An ambulance approaches.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.216
It has a high-pitched siren.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.976
(Imitates a siren passing by)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.336
The siren appeared to change in pitch

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.440
as it moved towards and away from you.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.840
The ambulance driver did not change
the siren just to mess with you.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.616
That was a product of your perception.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.376
The sound waves,
as the ambulance approached,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.616
were compressed,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.576
and they changed higher in pitch.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.376
As the ambulance receded,
the sound waves were stretched,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.456
and they sounded lower in pitch.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.480
The same thing happens with light.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.416
Objects moving towards us,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.616
their light waves are compressed
and they appear bluer.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.856
Objects moving away from us,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.536
their light waves are stretched,
and they appear redder.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440
So we call these effects
blueshift and redshift.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.376
Now, our universe is expanding,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.576
so everything is moving away
from everything else,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.280
and that means
everything appears to be red.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.776
And oddly enough, as you look
more deeply into the universe,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.096
more distant objects
are moving away further and faster,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.839
so they appear more red.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.495
So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.216
and we were to continue
to peer deeply into the universe

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.776
just using the Hubble,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.496
as we get to a certain distance away,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120
everything becomes red,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.896
and that presents something of a problem.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.976
Eventually, we get so far away

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
everything is shifted into the infrared

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and we can't see anything at all.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.376
So there must be a way around this.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.216
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.136
I wanted to explore the whole universe,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.080
not just whatever I can see,
you know, before the redshift kicks in.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.416
There is a technique.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.816
It's called radio astronomy.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.176
Astronomers have been
using this for decades.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.496
It's a fantastic technique.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.006
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope,
affectionately known as "The Dish."

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.816
You may have seen the movie.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.416
And radio is really brilliant.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.976
It allows us to peer much more deeply.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.696
It doesn't get stopped by dust,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.976
so you can see everything in the universe,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.856
and redshift is less of a problem

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.080
because we can build receivers
that receive across a large band.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.536
So what does Parkes see when we turn it
to the center of the Milky Way?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.520
We should see something fantastic, right?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.056
Well, we do see something interesting.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.736
All that dust has gone.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.200
As I mentioned, radio goes
straight through dust, so not a problem.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.736
But the view is very different.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.576
We can see that the center
of the Milky Way is aglow,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.280
and this isn't starlight.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.096
This is a light called
synchrotron radiation,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.720
and it's formed from electrons
spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.376
So the plane is aglow with this light.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.696
And we can also see
strange tufts coming off of it,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.216
and objects which don't appear to line up

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.560
with anything that we can see
with our own eyes.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.656
But it's hard to really
interpret this image,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.456
because as you can see,
it's very low resolution.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.656
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.976
and that makes their resolution poorer.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.056
This image is also black and white,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.840
so we don't really know
what is the color of everything in here.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.016
Well, fast-forward to today.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.496
We can build telescopes

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.136
which can get over these problems.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.496
Now, I'm showing you here an image
of the Murchison Radio Observatory,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.296
a fantastic place
to build radio telescopes.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.616
It's flat, it's dry,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.616
and most importantly, it's radio quiet:

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.736
no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.256
just very, very radio quiet,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.000
so a perfect place
to build a radio telescope.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.736
Now, the telescope that I've been
working on for a few years

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.696
is called the Murchison Widefield Array,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.736
and I'm going to show you
a little time lapse of it being built.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.016
This is a group of undergraduate
and postgraduate students

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.296
located in Perth.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.056
We call them the Student Army,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.896
and they volunteered their time
to build a radio telescope.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.560
There's no course credit for this.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.216
And they're putting together
these radio dipoles.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.200
They just receive at low frequencies,
a bit like your FM radio or your TV.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.096
And here we are deploying them
across the desert.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.536
The final telescope
covers 10 square kilometers

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.696
of the Western Australian desert.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.696
And the interesting thing is,
there's no moving parts.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.976
We just deploy these little antennas

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.856
essentially on chicken mesh.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.296
It's fairly cheap.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.296
Cables take the signals

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.376
from the antennas

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.936
and bring them
to central processing units.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.736
And it's the size of this telescope,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.416
the fact that we've built it
over the entire desert

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
that gives us a better
resolution than Parkes.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.416
Now, eventually all those cables
bring them to a unit

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.976
which sends it off
to a supercomputer here in Perth,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.286
and that's where I come in.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.536
(Sighs)

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.776
Radio data.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.616
I have spent the last five years

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.496
working with very difficult,
very interesting data

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.496
that no one had really looked at before.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.656
I've spent a long time calibrating it,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.576
running millions of CPU hours
on supercomputers

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.800
and really trying to understand that data.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.296
And with this telescope,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.576
with this data,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.536
we've performed a survey
of the entire southern sky,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.656
the GaLactic and Extragalactic
All-sky MWA Survey,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.560
or GLEAM, as I call it.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.896
And I'm very excited.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.301
This survey is just about to be published,
but it hasn't been shown yet,

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.256
so you are literally the first people

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.080
to see this southern survey
of the entire sky.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.120
So I'm delighted to share with you
some images from this survey.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.775
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.895
you camped out underneath the stars

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.536
and you looked towards the south.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.227
You saw the south's celestial pole,

00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:47.456
the galaxy rising.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.096
If I fade in the radio light,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.776
this is what we observe with our survey.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.856
You can see that the galactic plane
is no longer dark with dust.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.296
It's alight with synchrotron radiation,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.816
and thousands of dots are in the sky.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.136
Our large Magellanic Cloud,
our nearest galactic neighbor,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.376
is orange instead
of its more familiar blue-white.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.776
So there's a lot going on in this.
Let's take a closer look.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.216
If we look back
towards the galactic center,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.456
where we originally saw the Parkes image
that I showed you earlier,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.856
low resolution, black and white,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.960
and we fade to the GLEAM view,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.056
you can see the resolution
has gone up by a factor of a hundred.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.936
We now have a color view of the sky,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.296
a technicolor view.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.296
Now, it's not a false color view.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.720
These are real radio colors.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.416
What I've done is I've colored
the lowest frequencies red

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.056
and the highest frequencies blue,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.656
and the middle ones green.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.896
And that gives us this rainbow view.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.176
And this isn't just false color.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.136
The colors in this image
tell us about the physical processes

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.400
going on in the universe.

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:54.736
So for instance, if you look
along the plane of the galaxy,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.216
it's alight with synchrotron,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.616
which is mostly reddish orange,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.760
but if we look very closely,
we see little blue dots.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.896
Now, if we zoom in,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.456
these blue dots are ionized plasma

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.120
around very bright stars,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.456
and what happens
is that they block the red light,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.120
so they appear blue.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.816
And these can tell us
about these star-forming regions

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.096
in our galaxy.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.736
And we just see them immediately.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.816
We look at the galaxy,
and the color tells us that they're there.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.416
You can see little soap bubbles,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.856
little circular images
around the galactic plane,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.880
and these are supernova remnants.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.296
When a star explodes,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.776
its outer shell is cast off

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.096
and it travels outward into space
gathering up material,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.080
and it produces a little shell.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.176
It's been a long-standing
mystery to astronomers

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.280
where all the supernova remnants are.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.296
We know that there must be a lot
of high-energy electrons in the plane

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.976
to produce the synchrotron
radiation that we see,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.576
and we think they're produced
by supernova remnants,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.376
but there don't seem to be enough.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.296
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really
good at detecting supernova remnants,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.800
so we're hoping to have
a new paper out on that soon.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.056
Now, that's fine.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.416
We've explored our little local universe,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.816
but I wanted to go deeper,
I wanted to go further.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.920
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.296
Well, as it happens, we can see a very
interesting object in the top right,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.536
and this is a local radio galaxy,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.800
Centaurus A.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.496
If we zoom in on this,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.920
we can see that there are
two huge plumes going out into space.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.496
And if you look right in the center
between those two plumes,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.896
you'll see a galaxy just like our own.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.376
It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.016
It's a normal galaxy.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.656
But these jets
are only visible in the radio.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.856
If we looked in the visible,
we wouldn't even know they were there,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.920
and they're thousands of times larger
than the host galaxy.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.880
What's going on?
What's producing these jets?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.696
At the center of every galaxy
that we know about

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.976
is a supermassive black hole.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.416
Now, black holes are invisible.
That's why they're called that.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.456
All you can see is the deflection
of the light around them,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.776
and occasionally, when a star
or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.536
it is ripped apart by tidal forces,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.040
forming what we call an accretion disk.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.856
The accretion disk
glows brightly in the x-rays,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.296
and huge magnetic fields
can launch the material into space

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.040
at nearly the speed of light.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.680
So these jets are visible in the radio

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.400
and this is what we pick up in our survey.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.056
Well, very well, so we've seen
one radio galaxy. That's nice.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.256
But if you just look
at the top of that image,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.016
you'll see another radio galaxy.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.280
It's a little bit smaller,
and that's just because it's further away.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.456
OK. Two radio galaxies.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.056
We can see this. This is fine.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.816
Well, what about all the other dots?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.400
Presumably those are just stars.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.096
They're not.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.720
They're all radio galaxies.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.216
Every single one of the dots in this image

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.976
is a distant galaxy,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.856
millions to billions of light-years away

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.496
with a supermassive
black hole at its center

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.096
pushing material into space
at nearly the speed of light.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.880
It is mind-blowing.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.416
And this survey is even larger
than what I've shown here.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.976
If we zoom out to
the full extent of the survey,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.096
you can see I found 300,000
of these radio galaxies.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.016
So it's truly an epic journey.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.696
We've discovered all of these galaxies

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.280
right back to the very first
supermassive black holes.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm very proud of this,
and it will be published next week.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.096
Now, that's not all.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.456
I've explored the furthest reaches
of the galaxy with this survey,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.440
but there's something
even more in this image.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.616
Now, I'll take you right back
to the dawn of time.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.296
When the universe formed,
it was a big bang,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.376
which left the universe
as a sea of hydrogen,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.896
neutral hydrogen.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.696
And when the very first stars
and galaxies switched on,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.816
they ionized that hydrogen.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.280
So the universe went
from neutral to ionized.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.336
That imprinted a signal all around us.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.096
Everywhere, it pervades us,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.536
like the Force.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.280
Now, because that happened so long ago,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.800
the signal was redshifted,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.856
so now that signal
is at very low frequencies.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.336
It's at the same frequency as my survey,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.736
but it's so faint.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.640
It's a billionth the size
of any of the objects in my survey.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.216
So our telescope may not be quite
sensitive enough to pick up this signal.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.736
However, there's a new radio telescope.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.416
So I can't have a starship,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.696
but I can hopefully have

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.576
one of the biggest
radio telescopes in the world.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.216
We're building the Square Kilometre Array,
a new radio telescope,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.976
and it's going to be a thousand
times bigger than the MWA,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.216
a thousand times more sensitive,
and have an even better resolution.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.456
So we should find
tens of millions of galaxies.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.816
And perhaps, deep in that signal,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.016
I will get to look upon the very first
stars and galaxies switching on,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.400
the beginning of time itself.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.136
Thank you.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.920
(Applause)
