00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:03.880
I want to tell you a story about a girl.

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:06.627
But I can't tell you her real name.

00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:08.928
So let's just call her Hadiza.

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.050
Hadiza is 20.

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.790
She's shy,

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.048
but she has a beautiful smile
that lights up her face.

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:18.889
But she's in constant pain.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:24.117
And she will likely be on medication
for the rest of her life.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:26.551
Do you want to know why?

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.821
Hadiza is a Chibok girl,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.078
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:35.726
by Boko Haram terrorists.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.979
She managed to escape, though,

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.200
by jumping off the truck
that was carrying the girls.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:45.517
But when she landed,
she broke both her legs,

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.961
and she had to crawl on her tummy
to hide in the bushes.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:53.063
She told me she was terrified
that Boko Haram would come back for her.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:58.331
She was one of 57 girls who would escape
by jumping off trucks that day.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.896
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.292
around the world.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:05.586
People like Michelle Obama,
Malala and others

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.702
lent their voices in protest,

00:01:07.726 --> 00:01:10.987
and at about the same time --
I was living in London at the time --

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.654
I was sent from London to Abuja
to cover the World Economic Forum

00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:18.100
that Nigeria was hosting
for the first time.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:22.719
But when we arrived, it was clear
that there was only one story in town.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.754
We put the government under pressure.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.340
We asked tough questions
about what they were doing

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:29.855
to bring these girls back.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.103
Understandably,

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:34.934
they weren't too happy
with our line of questioning,

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.707
and let's just say we received
our fair share of "alternative facts."

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.412
(Laughter)

00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:44.634
Influential Nigerians
were telling us at the time

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.655
that we were naÃ¯ve,

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.883
we didn't understand
the political situation in Nigeria.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.995
But they also told us

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.627
that the story of the Chibok girls

00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.836
was a hoax.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.965
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.279
and there are still people
in Nigeria today

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:06.066
who believe that the Chibok girls
were never kidnapped.

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:09.494
Yet I was talking to people like these --

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.106
devastated parents,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.184
who told us that on the day
Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:20.782
they ran into the Sambisa Forest
after the trucks carrying their daughters.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:24.534
They were armed with machetes,
but they were forced to turn back

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:26.407
because Boko Haram had guns.

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.008
For two years, inevitably,
the news agenda moved on,

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:32.762
and for two years,

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.945
we didn't hear much
about the Chibok girls.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.838
Everyone presumed they were dead.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.220
But in April last year,

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:42.449
I was able to obtain this video.

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.776
This is a still from the video

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.914
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,

00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:51.467
and through a source,
I obtained this video.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.646
But before I could publish it,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.695
I had to travel
to the northeast of Nigeria

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.786
to talk to the parents, to verify it.

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:02.694
I didn't have to wait
too long for confirmation.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.960
One of the mothers,
when she watched the video, told me

00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:09.684
that if she could have reached
into the laptop

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:13.727
and pulled our her child from the laptop,

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.157
she would have done so.

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:19.425
For those of you who are parents,
like myself, in the audience,

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.277
you can only imagine the anguish

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.760
that that mother felt.

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:32.155
This video would go on to kick-start
negotiation talks with Boko Haram.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.147
And a Nigerian senator told me
that because of this video

00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:38.164
they entered into those talks,

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:41.694
because they had long presumed
that the Chibok girls were dead.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.341
Twenty-one girls were freed
in October last year.

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.933
Sadly, nearly 200 of them
still remain missing.

00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:55.888
I must confess that I have not been
a dispassionate observer

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.098
covering this story.

00:03:57.122 --> 00:04:00.930
I am furious when I think
about the wasted opportunities

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:03.421
to rescue these girls.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:07.345
I am furious when I think about
what the parents have told me,

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.143
that if these were daughters
of the rich and the powerful,

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.328
they would have been found much earlier.

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.289
And I am furious

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:18.241
that the hoax narrative,

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:20.143
I firmly believe,

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.279
caused a delay;

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.292
it was part of the reason
for the delay in their return.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.195
This illustrates to me
the deadly danger of fake news.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.811
So what can we do about it?

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:35.800
There are some very smart people,

00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:38.283
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:43.372
who are trying to use technology
to stop the spread of fake news.

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:48.147
But beyond that, I think
everybody here -- you and I --

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.358
we have a role to play in that.

00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:52.675
We are the ones who share the content.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.210
We are the ones who share
the stories online.

00:04:55.234 --> 00:04:57.421
In this day and age, we're all publishers,

00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.026
and we have responsibility.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.360
In my job as a journalist,

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:05.412
I check, I verify.

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:08.717
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.496
Why is this person telling me this story?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.019
What do they have to gain
by sharing this information?

00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:17.851
Do they have a hidden agenda?

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:24.173
I really believe that we must all start
to ask tougher questions

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:26.507
of information that we discover online.

00:05:29.673 --> 00:05:35.404
Research shows that some of us
don't even read beyond headlines

00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:37.531
before we share stories.

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.094
Who here has done that?

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:41.279
I know I have.

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:43.794
But what if

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:49.504
we stopped taking information
that we discover at face value?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.823
What if we stop to think
about the consequence

00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:56.296
of the information that we pass on

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.531
and its potential to incite
violence or hatred?

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:05.130
What if we stop to think
about the real-life consequences

00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:07.002
of the information that we share?

00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:09.905
Thank you very much for listening.

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:13.423
(Applause)
