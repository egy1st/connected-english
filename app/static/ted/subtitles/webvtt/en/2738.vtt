00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:02.549
Fresh out of college,

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:05.124
I went to work for a consulting firm.

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.852
During orientation,
the leaders dished out advice.

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:12.870
Amongst them was one pithy counsel
I will never forget.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.671
He told us, "Be easy to manage."

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:20.484
Considering how naÃ¯ve
I really was at the time,

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:22.275
I took his advice to heart.

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:23.794
I told myself,

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.674
"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:28.641
I will do everything I'm told.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.551
I will be easy to manage."

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:34.016
It wasn't until I arrived
in graduate school

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.956
and witnessed firsthand the criminal
actions of scientists and engineers

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.709
in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:46.291
that I realized how dangerous
and yet surprisingly common

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:48.333
this line of thinking really is.

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:49.865
Make no mistake:

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.531
the Flint water crisis is one of the most
egregious environmental injustices

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.706
of our time.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.286
For over 18 months,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.392
100,000 residents,
including thousands of young children,

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:05.299
were exposed to contaminated
drinking water with high levels of lead.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.916
Lead is a potent neurotoxin

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.680
which causes cognitive
and developmental disabilities

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:15.916
and is especially harmful
to growing fetuses and young children.

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:19.858
We've known about its dangers
since the Roman Empire.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.266
Amongst a whole host of health issues,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.007
12 people died by contracting
Legionnaires' disease.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.343
Flint's water infrastructure --

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.448
the complex network
of underground pipes --

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.540
has been severely damaged.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:38.276
And while the water quality
is slowly improving

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.351
and the pipes are being replaced now,

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.075
more than two years later,

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.449
the water is still not safe to drink.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:49.161
So, people are still in shock.

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:50.493
They ask themselves,

00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:52.198
"How could this have happened?"

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:57.870
The short answer is: the crisis began
when an emergency manager,

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.319
appointed by Michigan's governor,

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:04.801
decided to switch their water source
to a local river to save money.

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:07.222
But it continued for so long

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:10.883
because scientists and engineers
at government agencies

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:13.962
in the state of Michigan
and in the federal government

00:02:13.986 --> 00:02:17.495
did not follow federal regulations
for treating the water right.

00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:20.119
What was more,

00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:23.645
they actively cheated on the law
and orchestrated cover-ups.

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:26.976
They ridiculed residents asking for help,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.460
while publicly insisting that the brown,
smelly water coming out of the tap

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.757
was safe to drink.

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:39.413
The system at the local, state
and federal levels completely failed

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.429
to protect our most vulnerable,

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.110
and an entire population
was left to fend for itself.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.960
Now, amidst this injustice,
Flint residents were rallying together.

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:54.115
Amongst them were some
amazing women of Flint --

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.140
mothers concerned about their kids --

00:02:56.164 --> 00:03:00.057
who came together forming
many grassroots coalitions,

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:03.906
and these groups started protesting
and demanding change.

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:08.226
The group also reached out
to outside scientists for help,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.786
and a few responded.

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:13.959
Amongst them was a guy
named Miguel Del Toral,

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:18.661
a water expert at the US EPA --
the Environmental Protection Agency --

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.248
who actually wrote this scientific memo

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.412
and sent it to the state of Michigan
and the federal government

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.800
to bring their attention to this problem.

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.847
He was characterized a "rogue employee,"

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:31.335
and silenced.

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:35.514
In collaboration with Flint residents,

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.872
our research team here at Tech,

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:41.158
of students and scientists
led by professor Marc Edwards,

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:43.320
conducted citywide testing

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:46.352
to prove that Flint's water
was indeed contaminated,

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.654
even toxic in some homes.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:52.674
We substantiated what Flint
had been screaming for months,

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:55.846
and put it on the Internet
for the world to see.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.848
Now, when I was getting involved,

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.266
when I said yes to this,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.765
I had no idea what I was getting into.

00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:07.156
But every second of this journey
has been totally worth it.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.945
This was science
in service to the public.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.498
This is what I came
to graduate school for,

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:15.295
and this is how I would rather
spend my life.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.894
And so this coalition --

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:22.811
this unlikely coalition of citizens,
pastors, journalists and scientists --

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:27.235
came together to uncover the truth
using science, advocacy and activism.

00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:29.818
A local pediatrician figured out

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:34.181
that the instances of childhood
lead poisoning had indeed doubled

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:36.016
in Flint during the crisis.

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:40.811
And the state of Michigan was forced
to acknowledge the problem

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:43.355
and take steps to correct it.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.915
This group and many others
got Flint's kids protected.

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:49.176
A few months later,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.669
President Obama came in
and declared a federal emergency,

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:56.201
and now Flint is getting
more than 600 million dollars

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:59.624
in healthcare, nutrition, education

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:01.966
and overhauling
their water infrastructure.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.887
However, the arrogance and the callous
disregard for public health

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:13.339
shown by scientists and engineers
at these government agencies

00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:14.766
is beyond belief.

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.261
These unhealthy cultures
that are festering in these groups,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:23.230
where the focus is on meeting
regulations and checking boxes

00:05:23.254 --> 00:05:25.404
as opposed to protecting public health,

00:05:25.428 --> 00:05:26.901
is just appalling.

00:05:27.596 --> 00:05:31.897
Just consider this email
that an EPA employee wrote,

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.143
where she goes,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:38.315
"I'm not so sure Flint is a community
we want to go out on a limb for."

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.336
The dehumanization of an entire population
could not be more obvious.

00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:49.760
Now, contrast that to the first
canon of engineering,

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:53.045
which, in my opinion, should be
the first law of humanity:

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.146
"To hold paramount the health,
safety and welfare of the public,"

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.840
above all else.

00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:02.308
This is the Hippocratic Oath
we've rarely acknowledged,

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:03.690
let alone embraced.

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:08.775
And so when scientists and engineers,
very much like medical doctors,

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.048
screw up,

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.913
people can get hurt --

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:13.308
even die.

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:17.877
If our professionals and even
students fail to get that,

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:19.955
society pays a huge price.

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:25.853
Buried deep in history lies
a character I deeply admire --

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:29.018
an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.939
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:37.359
And Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble
for his radical honesty

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:42.938
and willingness to point out major flaws
in the Soviets' mindless pursuit

00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:44.895
of rapid industrialization.

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.747
Everyone was expected to follow orders
coming from the top.

00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:53.670
Anyone asking questions
or offering feedback was unwelcome.

00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:59.632
The Soviets had created the largest army
of engineers the world had ever seen,

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:04.697
and yet most of them were mere cogs
in a gigantic machine heading for doom.

00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:08.506
Palchinsky, on the other hand,
implored engineers

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.866
to look at the economic, political
and social consequences of their actions;

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.879
in other words, be more public-focused.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:20.702
His fearless voice of reason
was seen as a threat

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:22.543
to the political establishment,

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:26.337
and Joseph Stalin
had him executed in 1929.

00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:31.853
Palchinsky's view on technocrats
is very different

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:37.227
from one that is still very popular,
still very common --

00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:42.960
that of a dispassionate researcher
working in his ivory tower lab,

00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:45.951
or a nerdy engineer
working in his cubicle.

00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.810
Brilliant, no doubt,

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.764
yet somehow cut off from the world,

00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:53.000
shows little emotion --

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:56.357
kind of like Spock
from "Star Trek," you know?

00:07:56.947 --> 00:07:58.183
This guy.

00:07:58.207 --> 00:07:59.804
(Laughter)

00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.599
Let's try and do the Spock salute.

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:03.862
I don't think I'll succeed ...

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:06.640
See, I can't be Spock.

00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:08.802
Thank goodness I can't be Spock.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:09.976
(Laughter)

00:08:11.332 --> 00:08:16.089
I was reminded of this distinction
because a recent article came out

00:08:16.113 --> 00:08:19.339
in a very reputed scientific journal,

00:08:19.363 --> 00:08:24.686
which kind of characterized our Flint work
as driven by "youthful idealism,"

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.389
and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities."

00:08:27.413 --> 00:08:32.904
It asks scientists to protect
their research funding and institutions

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:36.279
at all costs, no matter
how just the cause.

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:39.625
And if you think you have to get
involved in something,

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.684
even if it's an emergency,

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:45.861
try finding an activist group or an NGO,

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:48.881
and obtain the full support
of the academic community --

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:50.243
whatever that means --

00:08:50.267 --> 00:08:51.979
before you get involved.

00:08:52.627 --> 00:08:56.772
Not one mention of our moral
and professional obligation

00:08:56.796 --> 00:08:58.859
of preventing harm to the public,

00:08:58.883 --> 00:09:02.252
or the fact that we have
all this expertise,

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.301
resources and, for some, even tenure

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:07.971
to, you know, accomplish this task.

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:11.505
I'm not saying every scientist
should be an activist.

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:16.348
There are real and sometimes very painful
consequences of speaking up.

00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:21.203
But to denounce this idea,
this possibility so completely

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.623
so that you can protect research funding,

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:26.272
simply screams of self-serving cowardice,

00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:31.497
and these are not the ideals
we would want to pass to our students.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.932
And so you may think,
"OK, all this sounds great,

00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:39.579
but you'll never completely change
organizational cultures,

00:09:39.603 --> 00:09:43.650
or imbibe mindsets in students
and professionals

00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:46.311
to look at their work as a public good --

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.395
science in service to the public."

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:50.530
Maybe so.

00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:52.796
But could a big reason for that be

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.480
that we are not training
our students right?

00:09:56.021 --> 00:09:58.323
Because if you look closely,

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:03.259
our education system today
is focused more on creating

00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:08.338
what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz
calls "excellent sheep" --

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.217
young people who are smart and ambitious,

00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:16.145
and yet somehow risk-averse,
timid, directionless

00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:18.971
and, sometimes, full of themselves.

00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.914
Now, kids ... you know,

00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:23.554
we fell in love with science
when we were kids,

00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:27.880
and yet we somehow spend most of our time
during high school and college

00:10:27.904 --> 00:10:29.401
just jumping through hoops

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:32.892
and doing things
so that we can polish our rÃ©sumÃ©

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:34.586
instead of sitting down

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.129
and reflecting on what we want to do
and who we want to be.

00:10:41.132 --> 00:10:42.398
And so,

00:10:43.624 --> 00:10:47.259
the markers of empathy
in our college graduates

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:50.426
have been dropping dramatically
in the past two decades,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.176
while those of narcissism are on the rise.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.871
There is also a growing culture
of disengagement

00:10:55.895 --> 00:10:58.828
between engineering students
and the public.

00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:04.885
We are trained to build bridges
and solve complex problems

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:09.923
but not how to think or live
or be a citizen of this world.

00:11:09.947 --> 00:11:14.340
My undergraduate years
were explicit job preparation,

00:11:14.364 --> 00:11:18.570
and I cannot tell you how suffocating
and painful it was at times.

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:21.540
And so,

00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:25.141
some people think the solution
to great engineers, to great scientists,

00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:26.969
is more technical training.

00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:28.226
Maybe so.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.744
But where are the discussions
on ethical decision-making,

00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:33.593
or building character,

00:11:33.617 --> 00:11:36.457
or discerning right from wrong?

00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:41.988
Consider this project
that I deeply love and admire.

00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:44.790
It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project."

00:11:44.814 --> 00:11:47.437
A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:50.239
famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:55.508
this program seeks to train
school-going children around the world

00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:58.972
to look at themselves
as heroes-in-waiting,

00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:00.912
or heroes-in-training.

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:06.287
So, these young minds work over time
to develop skills and virtues

00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:08.471
so that when the opportunity comes,

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:11.065
no matter what that opportunity be,

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:13.697
to stand up and do the right thing.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.647
In other words,

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.588
anyone can be a hero.

00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:20.524
Think about that idea for a second.

00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:24.239
Why don't we teach science
and engineering like that --

00:12:24.263 --> 00:12:28.641
where heroism and public service
are seen as key values,

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.283
because indeed, it's often heroism

00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:35.055
that is not only the antidote
to public indifference,

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:39.036
but also to systemic evil
like we saw in Flint.

00:12:40.137 --> 00:12:41.571
And so, dream with me

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:45.752
what a 21st-century scientist
slash engineer could look like:

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:49.329
individuals who are driven
to master the sciences

00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:51.327
so that they can serve society,

00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:52.545
and are also aware

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:56.045
of the tremendous power
their knowledge and decisions have;

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.283
folks who are developing
their moral courage at all times,

00:13:00.307 --> 00:13:04.093
and who realize that conflict
and controversy

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.221
are not necessarily bad things

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:09.900
if our ultimate loyalty
is to the public and the planet.

00:13:10.821 --> 00:13:15.863
These are the people who will
stand up like we did in Flint --

00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:19.622
not to be saviors or heroes in the media,

00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:26.597
but altruistic and fundamentally good
actors that you and I can trust.

00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:32.510
Imagine fostering
such a public-focused mindset

00:13:32.534 --> 00:13:35.989
in classes, on service trips
and during activities

00:13:36.013 --> 00:13:38.355
during college or even high school,

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:42.193
so that these young minds
will hold onto those ideals

00:13:42.217 --> 00:13:44.689
when they actually enter the real world,

00:13:44.713 --> 00:13:48.836
whether that be consulting,
academia, policy making --

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.652
or even becoming
the president of a country.

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:57.090
Some of mankind's greatest
challenges lie ahead of us;

00:13:57.114 --> 00:14:00.121
contaminated drinking water
is just one example.

00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:02.661
We could definitely use more --

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:07.672
nay, we desperately need more --
compassionate upstanders

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:10.830
and public-focused
scientists and engineers

00:14:10.854 --> 00:14:12.863
who will strive to the do right thing,

00:14:12.887 --> 00:14:14.899
and not be easy to manage.

00:14:14.923 --> 00:14:16.094
Thank you.

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:20.642
(Applause)
