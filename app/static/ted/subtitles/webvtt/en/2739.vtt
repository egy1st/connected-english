00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:02.813
Last year ...

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:04.040
was hell.

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.862
(Laughter)

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.123
It was my first time eating
Nigerian "jollof."

00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:13.729
(Laughter)

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:17.475
Actually, in all seriousness,

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.313
I was going through a lot
of personal turmoil.

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.416
Faced with enormous stress,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.463
I suffered an anxiety attack.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:29.232
On some days, I could do no work.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:32.232
On other days,

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:35.545
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:41.907
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
with a mental health professional

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.034
about my stress and anxiety.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.071
Mental health?

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.862
I clammed up and violently
shook my head in protest.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.997
I felt a profound sense of a shame.

00:00:58.413 --> 00:01:01.851
I felt the weight of stigma.

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.498
I have a loving, supportive family

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:07.829
and incredibly loyal friends,

00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:12.422
yet I could not entertain
the idea of speaking to anyone

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:14.476
about my feeling of pain.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:20.471
I felt suffocated
by the rigid architecture

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.785
of our African masculinity.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.880
"People have real problems, Sangu.

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:27.359
Get over yourself!"

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.937
The first time I heard "mental health,"

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.843
I was a boarding school student
fresh off the boat from Ghana,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.798
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.473
I had just gone through
the brutal experience

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:45.050
of losing seven loved ones
in the same month.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.025
The school nurse,

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.113
concerned about what I'd gone
through -- God bless her soul --

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:54.087
she inquired about my mental health.

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.409
"Is she mental?" I thought.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.658
Does she not know I'm an African man?

00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:01.696
(Laughter)

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.591
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart,"

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:08.356
we African men neither process
nor express our emotions.

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:10.662
We deal with our problems.

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:12.229
(Applause)

00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:15.180
We deal with our problems.

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:19.975
I called my brother and laughed
about "Oyibo" people -- white people --

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.856
and their strange diseases --

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.118
depression, ADD and those "weird things."

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.491
Growing up in West Africa,

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.896
when people used the term "mental,"
what came to mind was a madman

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.163
with dirty, dread-locked hair,

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.963
bumbling around half-naked on the streets.

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:40.904
We all know this man.

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:43.209
Our parents warned us about him.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.365
"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?"

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.601
"Drugs!

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.014
If you even look at drugs,
you end up like him."

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:50.227
(Laughter)

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.045
Come down with pneumonia,

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.601
and your mother will rush you
to the nearest hospital

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.007
for medical treatment.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.706
But dare to declare depression,

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:04.860
and your local pastor
will be driving out demons

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.728
and blaming witches in your village.

00:03:07.298 --> 00:03:10.198
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.280
mental health is about being able to cope

00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:15.003
with the normal stressors of life;

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:19.364
to work productively and fruitfully;

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:23.015
and to be able to make
a contribution to your community.

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:30.113
Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological and social well-being.

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:35.616
Globally, 75 percent
of all mental illness cases

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.274
can be found in low-income countries.

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:40.130
Yet most African governments

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:44.361
invest less than one percent
of their health care budget

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:45.661
in mental health.

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:47.861
Even worse,

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:52.004
we have a severe shortage
of psychiatrists in Africa.

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:57.119
Nigeria, for example,
is estimated to have 200 --

00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:00.833
in a country of almost 200 million.

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:03.891
In all of Africa,

00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:07.818
90 percent of our people
lack access to treatment.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.434
As a result,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.462
we suffer in solitude,

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.930
silenced by stigma.

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:22.173
We as Africans often respond
to mental health with distance,

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:24.046
ignorance,

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:25.713
guilt,

00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:27.340
fear

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.220
and anger.

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:34.986
In a study conducted by Arboleda-FlÃ³rez,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.668
directly asking, "What is the cause
of mental illness?"

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:44.951
34 percent of Nigerian respondents
cited drug misuse;

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.524
19 percent said divine wrath
and the will of God --

00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:52.853
(Laughter)

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.908
12 percent,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.896
witchcraft and spiritual possession.

00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:04.356
But few cited other known
causes of mental illness,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.026
like genetics,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.986
socioeconomic status,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.605
war,

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.042
conflict

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:12.581
or the loss of a loved one.

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.896
The stigmatization against mental illness

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.386
often results in the ostracizing
and demonizing of sufferers.

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:26.431
Photojournalist Robin Hammond
has documented some of these abuses ...

00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:27.848
in Uganda,

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.174
in Somalia,

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:33.098
and here in Nigeria.

00:05:35.554 --> 00:05:36.896
For me,

00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:40.376
the stigma is personal.

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:43.751
In 2009,

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:47.902
I received a frantic call
in the middle of the night.

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:51.707
My best friend in the world --

00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:56.870
a brilliant, philosophical,
charming, hip young man --

00:05:56.894 --> 00:05:59.045
was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:06:00.604 --> 00:06:05.022
I witnessed some of the friends
we'd grown up with recoil.

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:08.839
I heard the snickers.

00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:11.220
I heard the whispers.

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:14.416
"Did you hear he has gone mad?"

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.805
(Kru English) "He has gone crazy!"

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.169
Derogatory, demeaning commentary
about his condition --

00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:26.170
words we would never say
about someone with cancer

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:27.954
or someone with malaria.

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:32.343
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:35.417
our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.888
I stood by his side
as his community isolated him,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.492
but our love never wavered.

00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:48.927
Tacitly, I became passionate
about mental health.

00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:52.506
Inspired by his plight,

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.853
I helped found the mental health
special interest alumni group

00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:57.532
at my college.

00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:00.933
And during my tenure as a resident
tutor in graduate school,

00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:04.919
I supported many undergraduates
with their mental health challenges.

00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.966
I saw African students struggle

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.827
and unable to speak to anyone.

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:14.742
Even with this knowledge
and with their stories in tow,

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.752
I, in turn, struggled,

00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:21.349
and could not speak to anyone
when I faced my own anxiety,

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:25.335
so deep is our fear of being the madman.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.113
All of us --

00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:32.065
but we Africans especially --

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:38.862
need to realize that our mental struggles
do not detract from our virility,

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.777
nor does our trauma taint our strength.

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:47.645
We need to see mental health
as important as physical health.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:52.986
We need to stop suffering in silence.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.577
We must stop stigmatizing disease

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.807
and traumatizing the afflicted.

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:03.038
Talk to your friends.

00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:05.590
Talk to your loved ones.

00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:08.339
Talk to health professionals.

00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:10.895
Be vulnerable.

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:13.672
Do so with the confidence

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:17.042
that you are not alone.

00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:20.371
Speak up if you're struggling.

00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:26.121
Being honest about how we feel

00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:27.804
does not make us weak;

00:08:28.809 --> 00:08:30.352
it makes us human.

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:36.225
It is time to end the stigma
associated with mental illness.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.521
So the next time your hear "mental,"

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.403
do not just think of the madman.

00:08:44.343 --> 00:08:45.552
Think of me.

00:08:45.976 --> 00:08:47.900
(Applause)

00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:49.207
Thank you.

00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:53.223
(Applause)
