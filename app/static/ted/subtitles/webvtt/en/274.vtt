00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do groups get anything done? Right?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
How do you organize a group of individuals

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that the output of the group

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is something coherent and of lasting value,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
instead of just being chaos?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the economic framing of that problem

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is called coordination costs.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or institutional difficulties in arranging group output.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You found something. It can be private or public.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But you get these resources together.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You found an institution, and you use the institution

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to coordinate the activities of the group.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
More recently, because the cost of letting groups

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
communicate with each other has fallen through the floor --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and communication costs are one of the big

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to design systems that coordinate the output

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
without regard to institutional models.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, that's what I want to talk about today.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but always pointing to the broader themes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Some people get less dressed up.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Young and old, dancing in the streets.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Colorful characters, and a good time is had by all.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
charming though it is, but rather to these photos.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I didn't take them. How did I get them?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Flickr is a photo-sharing service

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that allows people to take photos, upload them,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
share them over the Web and so forth.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Delicious is a social bookmarking service.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Right? If I had given this talk last year,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I couldn't do what I just did,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because I couldn't have found those photos.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But instead of saying,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we need to hire a professional class of librarians

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to organize these photos once they're uploaded,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Flickr simply turned over to the users

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the ability to characterize the photos.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
shown in reverse chronological order.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I was then able to go and retrieve them

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to give you that little slideshow.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now, what hard problem is being solved here?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And it's -- in the most schematic possible view,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
it's a coordination problem, right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There are a large number of people on the Internet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
How do we get those people together to contribute that work?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The classic answer is to form an institution, right?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
To draw those people into some prearranged structure

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that has explicit goals.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And I want to call your attention to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
some of the side effects of going the institutional route.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
First of all, when you form an institution,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you take on a management problem, right?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
No good just hiring employees,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Right? You have to have economic structure.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You have to have legal structure.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You have to have physical structure.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And that creates additional costs.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You can't hire everyone in a company, right?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You have to exclude some people.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And fourth, as a result of that exclusion,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We've gone from people with photos to photographers.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Right? We've created a professional class of photographers

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
or whatever else they're sent out to photograph.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which is the Flickr answer,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
you can leave the people where they are

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and you take the problem to the individuals, rather than

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
moving the individuals to the problem.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
You arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You lose the institutional imperative.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but you also shed the institutional cost,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
which gives you greater flexibility.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
whenever you bought your first mobile phone,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and you stopped making plans.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
"Call me when you get off work." Right?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we must have a five-year projection

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and let's deal with it as we go,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
because we're now well-enough coordinated

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And everything that was hard about the coordination cost

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
There are more pictures. There are more photographers.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's taken over a wider geographic area.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And worst of all, that figure at the bottom,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It's mathematically true,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
but it doesn't really talk about anything important --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
because in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
What matters is this.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You can see here, over at the end,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And by the time we get around here,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And by the time you get to the middle,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
you've got hundreds of people

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
who have contributed only one photo each.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This is called a power-law distribution.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It appears often in unconstrained social systems

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
this is often what you get. Right?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
relative to the person in the first position.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to have contributed about a tenth of the photos,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and the hundredth most prolific photographer

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
as the most prolific photographer did.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and for the long, flat tail.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the systems don't converge; they diverge more.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
In bigger systems, the head gets bigger

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
they account for three quarters of the photos taken --

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If you go down to five percent,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And because of this left weighting,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the average is actually here, way to the left.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And that sounds strange to our ears,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
have contributed a below-average amount.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
That sounds strange because we expect average and middle

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to be about the same, but they're not at all.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
this is what's going on. Right?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
this is the shape people are talking about when that happens.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000
The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The institutional model always pushes leftwards,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
treating these people as employees.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The institutional response is,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that's what I'll do.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The cooperative infrastructure model says,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
why do you want to give up a quarter of the value?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
If your system is designed

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so that you have to give up a quarter of the value,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
re-engineer the system.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Don't take on the cost that prevents you

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
from getting to the contributions of these people.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So the coordination response asks not,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
how are these people as employees, but rather,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
what is their contribution like? Right?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Right? So the question is,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
do you want that photo? Yes or no.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And the tension here is between institution as enabler

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and institution as obstacle.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
When you're dealing with the left-hand edge

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of one of these distributions,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
producing a lot of the material you want,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that's an institution-as-enabler world.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and you can get some output.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
are adding one photo at a time,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that's institution as obstacle.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
One of the first things that happens

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
when you institutionalize a problem

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
is that the first goal of the institution

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to self-preservation.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and that there are other ways of coordinating the value,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Laughter)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
-- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
haven't been around long enough

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to have gotten to the acceptance phase.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Many, many institutions are still in denial,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
right, because the fact that they have coordinated

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You can follow this in the Guardian.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's actually quite entertaining.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The bigger question is,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
what do you do about the value down here?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Right? How do you capture that?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
"Oh, this business of thousands of programmers

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
contributing to Linux, this is a myth.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and most of the patches have been produced by programmers

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
who've only done one thing." Right?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You can hear this distribution under that complaint.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that's a bad idea, right?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
(Laughter)

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Right? Bad hire. Right?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
(Laughter)

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
What if it was a security patch?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
of which Windows has not some, [but] several?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Do you want that patch, right?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The fact that a single programmer can,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
without having to move into a professional relation

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to an institution, improve Linux once

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
systems of open-source software, of file sharing,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but there are actually stories about this from all over.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Meetup, a service founded so that users could find people

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in their local area who share their interests and affinities

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
or a pub or what have you.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
he thought it would be used for, you know,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The inventors don't know what the invention is.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Number one group on Meetup right now,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Stay-at-home moms. Right?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
In the suburbanized, dual-income United States,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
stay-at-home moms are actually missing

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the social infrastructure that comes from extended family

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and local, small-scale neighborhoods.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So they're reinventing it, using these tools.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Meetup is the platform,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but the value here is in social infrastructure.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
If you want to know what technology is going to change the world,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
don't pay attention to 13-year-old boys --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
pay attention to young mothers,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
because they have got not an ounce of support for technology

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that doesn't materially make their lives better.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is so much more important than Xbox,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
but it's a lot less glitzy.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I think this is a revolution.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I think that this is a really profound change

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
in the way human affairs are arranged.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And I use that word advisedly.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
she's a reporter for the New York Times --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
This is happening, however, against the background

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
of the rise of Web logging.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It has de-professionalized publishing.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Want to publish globally anything you think today?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
That has sent the professional class of publishing down

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
into the ranks of mass amateurization.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And so the shield law, as much as we want it --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we want a professional class of truth-tellers --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
it is becoming increasingly incoherent, because

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the institution is becoming incoherent.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
There are people in the States right now

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
tying themselves into knots, trying to figure out

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
whether or not bloggers are journalists.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And the answer to that question is,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Journalism was an answer to an even more important question,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
which is, how will society be informed?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
How will they share ideas and opinions?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the professional framework of journalism,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and apply it to this distributed class.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So as much as we want the shield laws,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
the background -- the institution to which they were attached --

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is becoming incoherent.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Here's another example.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
These are groups of teenage girls

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
other kinds of cooperative infrastructure,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and have used it to set up support groups for

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
remaining anorexic by choice.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
They even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
these red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I am trying to maintain my eating disorder.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
We're used to support groups being beneficial.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
a way of living in the context of a larger group.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
that's a great support group.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But when the small group is teenage girls

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
who want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What's happened is that the normative goals

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
of the support groups that we're used to,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
came from the institutions that were framing them,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and not from the infrastructure.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Once the infrastructure becomes generically available,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
the logic of the support group has been revealed to be

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
accessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So, there are significant downsides to these changes

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
who perpetrated the 9/11 attack.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell you

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
what's going to come as a result of all of this,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
but I'm running out of time, which is good,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
because I don't know.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
(Laughter)

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It takes us from Point A to chaos.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
The printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
moving from a world where the Catholic Church

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
when we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
are going to be given increasingly high leverage,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives --

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
like deciding in advance what's going to happen,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And institutions are going to come under

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
an increasing degree of pressure,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And that's going to happen one arena at a time,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
one institution at a time. The forces are general,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
but the results are going to be specific.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And so the point here is not,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
from only institutions to only cooperative framework."

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It's going to be much more complicated than that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
(Applause)
