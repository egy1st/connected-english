00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:02.657
"Look at me!"

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:09.301
That phrase turned me
into an eye-contact coach.

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.739
I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.463
Ivan has autism,

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:18.032
he doesn't speak,

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.046
and he communicates through an iPad,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.942
where his whole universe of words
exists in images.

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:30.489
He was diagnosed
when he was two and a half.

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:35.720
I still remember that day painfully.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.212
My husband and I felt really lost;

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.667
we didn't know where to begin.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.365
There was no internet,

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.819
you couldn't Google information,

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:52.682
so we made those first steps

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.745
out of sheer intuition.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.939
Ivan would not maintain eye contact,

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.260
he had lost the words that he did know,

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:08.261
and he didn't respond to his name
or to anything we asked him,

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.356
as if words were noise.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.375
The only way I could know

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.635
what was going on with him,

00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:21.802
what he felt,

00:01:22.337 --> 00:01:24.196
was looking him in the eye.

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:27.962
But that bridge was broken.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.052
How could I teach him about life?

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:39.427
When I did things he liked,
he would look at me,

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.985
and we were connected.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:45.453
So I dedicated myself
to working with him on those things,

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.806
so we would have more and more
eye-contact moments.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.811
We would spend hours and hours playing tag
with his older sister, Alexia,

00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:01.119
and when we said: "I caught you!"

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.880
he would look around for us,

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.709
and at that moment,
I could feel he was alive.

00:02:13.088 --> 00:02:18.015
We also hold a record for hours spent
in a swimming pool.

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:22.538
Ivan always had a passion for water.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.691
I remember when he was two and a half,

00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:31.061
on a rainy winter day,

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.561
I was taking him to an indoor pool,

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:36.235
because even on rainy days
we'd go swimming.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:41.511
We were on the highway,
and I took the wrong exit.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:46.237
He burst into tears and cried
inconsolably, nonstop,

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.781
until I turned back.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.158
Only then did he calm down.

00:02:51.528 --> 00:02:55.224
How was it possible
that a two and a half year old

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:57.055
didn't respond to his own name,

00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:01.975
yet in the middle of the rain and fog,
where I couldn't see anything,

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.305
he knew the exact route?

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.506
That's when I realized that Ivan
had an exceptional visual memory,

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:16.942
and that that would be my way in.

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.197
So I started taking
pictures of everything,

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.014
and teaching him what life was like,

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:26.628
showing it to him, picture by picture.

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:32.456
Even now, it's the way Ivan communicates

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.842
what he wants,

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:35.590
what he needs

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:38.782
and also what he feels.

00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:45.222
But it wasn't just
Ivan's eye contact that mattered.

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:48.896
Everyone else's did, too.

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.725
How could I make people see
not only his autism,

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.145
but see him the person

00:03:57.312 --> 00:03:58.981
and everything he can give;

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.062
everything he can do;

00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:06.025
the things he likes and doesn't like,

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.889
just like any one of us?

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.381
But for that, I also had
to give of myself.

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:15.841
I had to have the strength to let him go,

00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:18.955
which was extremely difficult.

00:04:21.297 --> 00:04:22.767
Ivan was 11 years old,

00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:27.445
and he went for treatment
in a neighborhood near our house.

00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:32.224
One afternoon,
while I was waiting for him,

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:34.199
I went into a greengrocer,

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.492
a typical neighborhood store
with a little bit of everything.

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:39.980
While doing the shopping,

00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:43.214
I started talking to Jose, the owner.

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:46.325
I told him about Ivan,

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:48.413
that he had autism,

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:53.705
and that I wanted him to learn
to walk down the street by himself,

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.829
without anyone holding his hand.

00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.541
So I decided to ask Jose
if Thursdays around 2pm,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.258
Ivan could come and help him arrange
the water bottles on the shelves,

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.597
because he loved to organize things.

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.387
And as a reward, he could buy
some chocolate cookies,

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.157
which were his favorite.

00:05:15.843 --> 00:05:17.343
He said "yes" right away.

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:22.057
So that's how it went for a year:

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.371
Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:28.756
help him arrange the shelves
of water bottles

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.043
with the labels perfectly
lined up on the same side,

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.674
and he would leave happy
with his chocolate cookies.

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:46.474
Jose is not an expert in autism.

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.102
There is no need to be an expert

00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:57.000
nor do anything heroic to include someone.

00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:02.080
We just need to be there --

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:04.087
(Applause)

00:06:10.942 --> 00:06:12.514
(Applause ends)

00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:15.254
Really, no heroic deed --

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.269
we simply need to be close.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.624
And if we are afraid of something

00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.695
or we don't understand something,

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.968
we need to ask.

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:30.862
Let's be curious

00:06:32.362 --> 00:06:35.522
but never indifferent.

00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:41.767
Let's have the courage
to look each other in the eye,

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:46.488
because by looking,

00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:49.585
we can open a whole world to someone else.

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:53.540
(Applause)

00:06:53.564 --> 00:06:55.888
(Cheers)
