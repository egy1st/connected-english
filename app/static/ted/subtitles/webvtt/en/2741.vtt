00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.016
I was 14 years old

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.616
inside of a bowling alley,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.400
burglarizing an arcade game,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.976
and upon exiting the building

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.200
a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.736
I ran down the street,
and I jumped on top of a fence.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.376
And when I got to the top,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.576
the weight of 3,000 quarters
in my book bag

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240
pulled me back down to the ground.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.936
So when I came to, the security guard
was standing on top of me,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.376
and he said, "Next time you little punks
steal something you can carry."

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.416
(Laughter)

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.576
I was taken to juvenile hall

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.160
and when I was released
into the custody of my mother,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.056
the first words my uncle said was,
"How'd you get caught?"

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.256
I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy."

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.216
He said, "Man, you weren't supposed
to take all the quarters."

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.056
I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do?"

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.976
And 10 minutes later, he took me
to burglarize another arcade game.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.640
We needed gas money to get home.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.480
That was my life.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.296
I grew up in Oakland, California,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.656
with my mother and members
of my immediate family

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.920
addicted to crack cocaine.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.000
My environment consisted
of living with family, friends,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.560
and homeless shelters.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.720
Oftentimes, dinner was served
in breadlines and soup kitchens.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.296
The big homey told me this:

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.296
money rules the world

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.536
and everything in it.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.640
And in these streets, money is king.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.936
And if you follow the money,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.480
it'll lead you to the bad guy
or the good guy.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.616
Soon after, I committed my first crime,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.616
and it was the first time
that I was told that I had potential

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.480
and felt like somebody believed in me.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.376
Nobody ever told me
that I could be a lawyer,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.056
doctor or engineer.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.496
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I couldn't read, write or spell.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.736
I was illiterate.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.320
So I always thought
crime was my way to go.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.176
And then one day

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.456
I was talking to somebody

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.080
and he was telling me
about this robbery that we could do.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.960
And we did it.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.896
The reality was that I was growing up

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.136
in the strongest
financial nation in the world,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.016
the United States of America,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
while I watched my mother
stand in line at a blood bank

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.360
to sell her blood for 40 dollars
just to try to feed her kids.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.640
She still has the needle marks
on her arms to day to show for that.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.216
So I never cared about my community.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.736
They didn't care about my life.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.176
Everybody there was doing what they
were doing to take what they wanted,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.376
the drug dealers,
the robbers, the blood bank.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.016
Everybody was taking blood money.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.936
So I got mine by any means necessary.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.536
I got mine.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680
Financial literacy
really did rule the world,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.656
and I was a child slave to it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.920
following the bad guy.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.456
At 17 years old, I was arrested
for robbery and murder

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.456
and I soon learned that finances in prison
rule more than they did on the streets,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.680
so I wanted in.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.656
One day, I rushed to grab
the sports page of the newspaper

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.496
so my cellie could read it to me,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.936
and I accidentally
picked up the business section.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.216
And this old man said,
"Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.496
And I said, "What's that?"

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.696
He said, "That's the place
where white folks keep all their money."

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.936
(Laughter)

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.816
And it was the first time
that I saw a glimpse of hope,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.336
a future.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.960
He gave me this brief description
of what stocks were,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.240
but it was just a glimpse.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.136
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.920
I couldn't read, write or spell.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.216
The skills that I had developed
to hide my illiteracy

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.216
no longer worked in this environment.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.336
I was trapped in a cage,
prey among predators,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.256
fighting for freedom I never had.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.456
I was lost, tired,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.840
and I was out of options.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.776
So at 20 years old,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.320
I did the hardest thing
I'd ever done in my life.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.360
I picked up a book,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.880
and it was the most agonizing
time of my life,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.136
trying to learn how to read,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.776
the ostracizing from my family,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.000
the homeys.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.736
It was rough, man.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.136
It was a struggle.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.856
But little did I know

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.296
I was receiving the greatest gifts
I had ever dreamed of:

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.520
self-worth,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.160
knowledge, discipline.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.696
I was so excited to be reading that I read
everything I could get my hands on:

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.055
candy wrappers, clothing logos,
street signs, everything.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.296
I was just reading stuff!

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.336
(Applause)

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.560
Just reading stuff.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.160
I was so excited to know how to read
and know how to spell.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.976
The homey came up, said,
"Man, what you eating?"

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.736
I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy."

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.016
(Laughter)

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.536
He said, "Let me get some."
I said, "N-O. No."

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.776
(Laughter)

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.216
It was awesome.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.416
I mean, I can actually now
for the first time in my life read.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.480
The feeling that I got
from it was amazing.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.840
And then at 22, feeling myself,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.536
feeling confident,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.400
I remembered what the OG told me.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.496
So I picked up the business section
of the newspaper.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.456
I wanted to find these rich white folks.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.080
(Laughter)

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.440
So I looked for that glimpse.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.096
As I furthered my career

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.976
in teaching others how to
financially manage money and invest,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.336
I soon learned that I had to take
responsibility for my own actions.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.376
True, I grew up
in a very complex environment,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.336
but I chose to commit crimes,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.136
and I had to own up to that.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.776
I had to take responsibility
for that, and I did.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.696
I was building a curriculum
that could teach incarcerated men

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.000
how to manage money
through prison employments.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.896
Properly managing our lifestyle
would provide transferrable tools

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.256
that we can use to manage money
when we reenter society,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.536
like the majority of people did
who didn't commit crimes.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.760
Then I discovered

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.736
that according to MarketWatch,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.296
over 60 percent of the American population

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.440
has under 1,000 dollars in savings.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.416
Sports Illustrated said that
over 60 percent of NBA players

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.976
and NFL players go broke.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.040
40 percent of marital problems
derive from financial issues.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.296
What the hell?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.456
(Laughter)

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.176
You mean to tell me
that people worked their whole lives,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.776
buying cars, clothes,
homes and material stuff

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.016
but were living check to check?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.376
How in the world were members of society
going to help incarcerated individuals

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.616
back into society

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.520
if they couldn't manage they own stuff?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.416
We screwed.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.176
(Laughter)

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.600
I needed a better plan.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.640
This is not going to work out too well.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.240
So ...

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.080
I thought.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.640
I now had an obligation
to meet those on the path

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.576
and help,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.856
and it was crazy because
I now cared about my community.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.240
Wow, imagine that.
I cared about my community.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.936
Financial illiteracy is a disease

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.976
that has crippled minorities
and the lower class in our society

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.136
for generations and generations,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.656
and we should be furious about that.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.256
Ask yourselves this:

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.536
How can 50 percent
of the American population

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.520
be financially illiterate in a nation
driven by financial prosperity?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.856
Our access to justice, our social status,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.896
living conditions, transportation and food

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.976
are all dependent on money
that most people can't manage.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.576
It's crazy!

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.976
It's an epidemic

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and a bigger danger to public safety
than any other issue.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.376
According to the California
Department of Corrections,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.736
over 70 percent of those incarcerated

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.376
have committed or have been charged
with money-related crimes:

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.920
robberies, burglaries,
fraud, larceny, extortion --

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.040
and the list goes on.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.136
Check this out:

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.096
a typical incarcerated person

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.616
would enter the California prison system

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.200
with no financial education,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.816
earn 30 cents an hour,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.056
over 800 dollars a year,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.840
with no real expenses and save no money.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.096
Upon his parole, he will be given
200 dollars gate money and told,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.200
"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.
Don't come back to prison."

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.096
With no meaningful preparation
or long-term financial plan,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.320
what does he do ... ?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.800
At 60?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.456
Get a good job,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.400
or go back to the very criminal behavior
that led him to prison in the first place?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.176
You taxpayers, you choose.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.360
Well, his education
already chose for him, probably.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.480
So how do we cure this disease?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.976
I cofounded a program

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.576
that we call Financial Empowerment
Emotional Literacy.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.056
We call it FEEL,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.256
and it teaches how do you separate
your emotional decisions

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.256
from your financial decisions,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.696
and the four timeless rules
to personal finance:

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.280
the proper way to save,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.200
control your cost of living,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.096
borrow money effectively

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.896
and diversify your finances
by allowing your money to work for you

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.736
instead of you working for it.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.920
Incarcerated people need these life skills
before we reenter society.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.376
You can't have full rehabilitation
without these life skills.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.216
This idea that only professionals
can invest and manage money

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.496
is absolutely ridiculous,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.187
and whoever told you that is lying.

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:18.176
(Applause)

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.616
A professional is a person

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.136
who knows his craft better than most,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.096
and nobody knows how much money
you need, have or want better than you,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.080
which means you are the professional.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.096
Financial literacy is not a skill,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.320
It's a lifestyle.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.056
Financial stability is a byproduct
of a proper lifestyle.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.880
A financially sound incarcerated person
can become a taxpaying citizen,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.176
and a financially sound
taxpaying citizen can remain one.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.536
This allows us to create a bridge
between those people who we influence:

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.296
family, friends and those young people

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.240
who still believe
that crime and money are related.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.616
So let's lose the fear and anxiety

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.096
of all the big financial words

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.696
and all that other nonsense
that you've been out there hearing.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.576
And let's get to the heart
of what's been crippling our society

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.960
from taking care of your responsibility
to be better life managers.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.336
And let's provide a simple
and easy to use curriculum

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.616
that gets to the heart, the heart

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.576
of what financial empowerment
and emotional literacy really is.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.496
Now, if you're sitting out here
in the audience and you said,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.936
"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me
and I don't buy it,"

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.256
then come take my class --

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.976
(Laughter)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.680
so I can show you how much money
it costs you every time you get emotional.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.120
(Applause)

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.136
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.320
(Applause)
