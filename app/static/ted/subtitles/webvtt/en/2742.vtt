WEBVTT

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.855
As patients,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.496
we usually remember
the names of our doctors,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.840
but often we forget
the names of our nurses.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
I remember one.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.616
I had breast cancer a few years ago,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.096
and somehow I managed
to get through the surgeries

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.400
and the beginning
of the treatment just fine.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.096
I could hide what was going on.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.336
Everybody didn't really have to know.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.576
I could walk my daughter to school,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.576
I could go out to dinner with my husband;

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.800
I could fool people.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.056
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.816
and that terrified me

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.376
because I knew that I was going to lose
every single hair on my body

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.960
because of the kind of chemo
that I was going to have.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.776
I wasn't going to be able
to pretend anymore

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
as though everything was normal.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.736
I was scared.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.336
I knew what it felt like to have
everybody treating me with kid gloves,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.736
and I just wanted to feel normal.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.936
I had a port installed in my chest.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.736
I went to my first day of chemotherapy,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.096
and I was an emotional wreck.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.135
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.136
and every bone in my body was telling
me to get up out of that chair

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.656
and take for the hills.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.440
But Joanne looked at me and talked
to me like we were old friends.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.656
And then she asked me,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.776
"Where'd you get your highlights done?"

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.896
(Laughter)

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.856
And I was like, are you kidding me?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.736
You're going to talk to me about my hair
when I'm on the verge of losing it?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.496
I was kind of angry,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.080
and I said, "Really? Hair?"

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.976
And with a shrug
of her shoulders she said,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.360
"It's gonna grow back."

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.536
And in that moment she said
the one thing I had overlooked,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.376
and that was that at some point,
my life would get back to normal.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.096
She really believed that.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.800
And so I believed it, too.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.296
Now, worrying about losing your hair
when you're fighting cancer

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.936
may seem silly at first,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.096
but it's not just that you're worried
about how you're going to look.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.040
It's that you're worried that everybody's
going to treat you so carefully.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.296
Joanne made me feel normal
for the first time in six months.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.175
We talked about her boyfriends,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.936
we talked about looking
for apartments in New York City,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.816
and we talked about my reaction
to the chemotherapy --

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.800
all kind of mixed in together.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.336
And I always wondered,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.000
how did she so instinctively
know just how to talk to me?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.896
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.720
marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.776
A few years later,
I was asked to do a project

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.480
that would celebrate
the work that nurses do.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.616
I started with Joanne,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.640
and I met over 100 nurses
across the country.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.376
I spent five years interviewing,
photographing and filming nurses

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.560
for a book and a documentary film.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.776
With my team,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.136
we mapped a trip across America
that would take us to places

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.096
dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation --

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
aging, war, poverty, prisons.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.096
And then we went places

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.976
where we would find
the largest concentration of patients

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.520
dealing with those issues.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.336
Then we asked hospitals and facilities
to nominate nurses

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.880
who would best represent them.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.640
One of the first nurses I met
was Bridget Kumbella.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.816
Bridget was born in Cameroon,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.680
the oldest of four children.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.256
Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.256
and really hurt his back.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.416
And he talked a lot about what it was like
to be flat on your back

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.880
and not get the kind
of care that you need.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.160
And that propelled Bridget
to go into the profession of nursing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.616
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.056
she has a really diverse group
of patients that she cares for,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.976
from all walks of life,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.960
and from all different religions.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.576
And she's devoted her career
to understanding the impact

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200
of our cultural differences
when it comes to our health.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.616
She spoke of a patient --

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.336
a Native American patient that she had --

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.080
that wanted to bring
a bunch of feathers into the ICU.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.096
That's how he found spiritual comfort.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.336
And she spoke of advocating for him

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.136
and said that patients come
from all different religions

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.056
and use all different kinds
of objects for comfort;

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.336
whether it's a holy rosary
or a symbolic feather,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.120
it all needs to be supported.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.016
This is Jason Short.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.096
Jason is a home health nurse
in the Appalachian mountains,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.496
and his dad had a gas station
and a repair shop when he was growing up.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.840
So he worked on cars in the community
that he now serves as a nurse.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.856
When he was in college,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.536
it was just not macho at all
to become a nurse,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.736
so he avoided it for years.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.696
He drove trucks for a little while,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.200
but his life path was always
pulling him back to nursing.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.216
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.056
Jason goes places
that an ambulance can't even get to.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.520
In this photograph,
he's standing in what used to be a road.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.896
Top of the mountain mining
flooded that road,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.216
and now the only way
for Jason to get to the patient

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.136
living in that house
with black lung disease

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.480
is to drive his SUV
against the current up that creek.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.440
The day I was with him,
we ripped the front fender off the car.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.376
The next morning he got up,
put the car on the lift,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.656
fixed the fender,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.776
and then headed out
to meet his next patient.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.936
I witnessed Jason
caring for this gentleman

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.776
with such enormous compassion,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.800
and I was struck again by how intimate
the work of nursing really is.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.136
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.776
He had just come back from a deployment

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.376
and he hadn't really settled back in
to life in San Diego yet.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.936
He talked about his experience
of being a nurse in Germany

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.936
and taking care of the soldiers
coming right off the battlefield.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.736
Very often, he would be
the first person they would see

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.840
when they opened
their eyes in the hospital.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.056
And they would look at him
as they were lying there,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.736
missing limbs,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.376
and the first thing they would say is,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.120
"When can I go back?
I left my brothers out there."

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.616
And Brian would have to say,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.216
"You're not going anywhere.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.080
You've already given enough, brother."

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.760
Brian is both a nurse and a soldier
who's seen combat.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.336
So that puts him in a unique position

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.720
to be able to relate to and help heal
the veterans in his care.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.056
This is Sister Stephen,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.296
and she runs a nursing home
in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.776
And the entire circle of life
can be found under her roof.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.256
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.976
so given the opportunity
to adopt local farm animals,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.056
she enthusiastically brings them in.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.616
And in the springtime,
those animals have babies.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.816
And Sister Stephen uses
those baby ducks, goats and lambs

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.096
as animal therapy
for the residents at Villa Loretto

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.456
who sometimes can't
remember their own name,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.040
but they do rejoice
in the holding of a baby lamb.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.216
The day I was with Sister Stephen,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.336
I needed to take her away
from Villa Loretto

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.456
to film part of her story.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.736
And before we left,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.240
she went into the room of a dying patient.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.776
And she leaned over and she said,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.720
"I have to go away for the day,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.216
but if Jesus calls you,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.456
you go.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.640
You go straight home to Jesus."

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.856
I was standing there and thinking

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.896
it was the first time in my life

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.216
I witnessed that you could show
someone you love them completely

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.440
by letting go.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.360
We don't have to hold on so tightly.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.976
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.040
than I have ever seen at any other time
at any other place in my life.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.376
We live in a complicated time
when it comes to our health care.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.576
It's easy to lose sight
of the need for quality of life,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.320
not just quantity of life.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.536
As new life-saving
technologies are created,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.560
we're going to have really
complicated decisions to make.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.136
These technologies often save lives,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.080
but they can also prolong pain
and the dying process.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.816
How in the world are we supposed
to navigate these waters?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.888
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.336
Nurses have a really unique
relationship with us

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.840
because of the time spent at bedside.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.976
During that time,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.520
a kind of emotional intimacy develops.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.216
This past summer, on August 9,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.160
my father died of a heart attack.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.256
My mother was devastated,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.240
and she couldn't imagine
her world without him in it.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.296
Four days later she fell,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.176
she broke her hip,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.696
she needed surgery

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.640
and she found herself
fighting for her own life.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.616
Once again I found myself

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.616
on the receiving end
of the care of nurses --

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.080
this time for my mom.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.736
My brother and my sister and I
stayed by her side

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.200
for the next three days in the ICU.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.096
And as we tried
to make the right decisions

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.496
and follow my mother's wishes,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.440
we found that we were depending
upon the guidance of nurses.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.656
And once again,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.200
they didn't let us down.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.376
They had an amazing insight
in terms of how to care for my mom

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.656
in the last four days of her life.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.840
They brought her comfort
and relief from pain.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.576
They knew to encourage my sister and I
to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.496
long after it mattered to her,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.320
but it sure meant a lot to us.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.760
And they knew to come and wake me up
just in time for my mom's last breath.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.016
And then they knew
how long to leave me in the room

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.720
with my mother after she died.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.696
I have no idea how they know these things,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.856
but I do know that I am eternally grateful

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.680
that they've guided me once again.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.416
Thank you so very much.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.437
(Applause)
