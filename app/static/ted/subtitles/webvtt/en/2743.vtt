WEBVTT

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.376
So there's this thing called
the law of unintended consequences.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.136
I thought it was just like a saying,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.736
but it actually exists, I guess.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.680
There's, like, academic papers about it.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.376
And I'm a designer.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.256
I don't like unintended consequences.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.856
People hire me because they have
consequences that they really intend,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.736
and what they intend is for me
to help them achieve those consequences.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.776
So I live in fear
of unintended consequences.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.480
And so this is a story about
consequences intended and unintended.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.216
I got called by an organization
called Robin Hood

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.816
to do a favor for them.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.256
Robin Hood is based in New York,
a wonderful philanthropic organization

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.016
that does what it says in the name.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.816
They take from rich people,
give it to poor people.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.736
In this case, what they wanted to benefit
was the New York City school system,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.096
a huge enterprise that educates
more than a million students at a time,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.456
and in buildings that are like this one,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.376
old buildings, big buildings,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.536
drafty buildings, sometimes buildings
that are in disrepair,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.096
certainly buildings
that could use a renovation.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.376
Robin Hood had this ambition
to improve these buildings in some way,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.856
but what they realized was

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.416
to fix the buildings would be
too expensive and impractical.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.816
So instead they tried to figure out
what one room they could go into

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.896
in each of these buildings,
in as many buildings that they could,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.576
and fix that one room

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.416
so that they could improve
the lives of the children inside

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.656
as they were studying.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.096
And what they came up with
was the school library,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.056
and they came up with this idea
called the Library Initiative.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.456
All the students
have to pass through the library.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.816
That's where the books are.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.176
That's where the heart
and soul of the school is.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.616
So let's fix these libraries.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.176
So they did this wonderful thing
where they brought in

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.296
first 10, then 20, then more architects,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.056
each one of whom was assigned a library
to rethink what a library was.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.136
They trained special librarians.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.216
So they started this mighty enterprise

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.256
to reform public schools
by improving these libraries.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.936
Then they called me up and they said,
"Could you make a little contribution?"

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.976
I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.856
And they said, "Well, we want you
to be the graphic designer

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.336
in charge of the whole thing."

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.936
And so I thought, I know what that means.
That means I get to design a logo.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.976
I know how to design that. I design logos.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.656
That's what people come to me for.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.776
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.056
Easy to do, actually,
compared with architecture

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.336
and being a librarian.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.096
Just do a logo, make a contribution,
and then you're out,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.056
and you feel really good about yourself.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.856
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel
good about myself when I do these favors.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.456
So I thought, let's overdeliver.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.416
I'm going to give you three logos,
all based on this one idea.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.776
So you have three options,
pick any of the three.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.096
They're all great, I said.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.336
So the basic idea was
these would be new school libraries

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.896
for New York schools,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.776
and so the idea is that it's a new thing,
a new idea that needs a new name.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.816
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea
that these were musty old libraries,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.456
the kind of places
that everyone is bored with,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.456
you know, not your grandparents' library.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.936
Don't worry about that at all.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.976
This is going to this new, exciting thing,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.256
not a boring library.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.936
So option number one:

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.976
so instead of thinking of it as a library,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.176
think of it as a place where it is like:
do talk, do make loud noises.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.216
Right? So no shushing,
it's like a shush-free zone.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.416
We're going to call it the Reading Room.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.816
That was option number one.
OK, option number two.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.256
Option number two was, wait for it,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.536
OWL.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.896
I'll meet you at OWL.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.216
I'm getting my book from the OWL.
Meet you after school down at OWL.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.576
I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.496
Well, it could be One World Library,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.136
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.656
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians
could figure out other things it could be

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.136
because they know about words.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.376
So other things, right?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.856
And then look at this.
It's like the eye of the owl.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.576
This is irresistible in my opinion.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.056
But there's even another idea.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.296
Option number three.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.936
Option number three
was based actually on language.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.256
It's the idea that "read"
is the past tense of "read,"

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.136
and they're both spelled the same way.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.096
So why don't we call
this place The Red Zone?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.549
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:05.133
Are you Red? Get Red.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.096
I'm well Red.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.336
(Laughter)

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.696
I really loved this idea,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.056
and I somehow was not focused on the idea

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.976
that librarians as a class are sort of
interested in spelling and I don't know.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.935
(Laughter)

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.456
But sometimes cleverness
is more important than spelling,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.896
and I thought this would be
one of those instances.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.936
So usually when I make these presentations

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.736
I say there's just one question
and the question should be,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.136
"How can I thank you, Mike?"

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.776
But in this case,
the question was more like,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.216
"Um, are you kidding?"

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.936
Because, they said,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.336
the premise of all this work

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.496
was that kids were bored
with old libraries, musty old libraries.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.736
They were tired of them.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.096
And instead, they said, these kids
have never really seen a library.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.936
The school libraries in these schools

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.376
are really so dilapidated,
if they're there at all,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.336
that they haven't bored anyone.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.336
They haven't even been there
to bore anyone at all.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.776
So the idea was, just forget
about giving it a new name.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.856
Just call it, one last try, a library.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.096
Right? OK.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.976
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.216
Exclamation point?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.216
Then -- this is because I'm clever --

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.776
move that into the "i,"

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.056
make it red,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.256
and there you have it,
the Library Initiative.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.816
So I thought, mission accomplished,
there's your logo.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.896
So what's interesting about this logo,
an unintended consequence,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.056
was that it turned out that
they didn't really even need my design

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.056
because you could type it any font,
you could write it by hand,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.176
and when they started
sending emails around,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.776
they just would use Shift and 1,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.376
they'd get their own logo
just right out of the thing.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.136
And I thought, well, that's fine.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.936
Feel free to use that logo.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.856
And then I embarked
on the real rollout of this thing --

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.816
working with every one of the architects

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.840
to put this logo on the front door
of their own library. Right?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.736
So here's the big rollout.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.016
Basically I'd work
with different architects.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.256
First Robin Hood was my client.
Now these architects were my client.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.519
I'd say, "Here's your logo.
Put it on the door."

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:01.496
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.536
"Here's your logo.
Put it off to the side."

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.816
"Here's your logo
repeated all over to the top."

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.536
So everything was going swimmingly.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.216
I just was saying,
"Here's your logo. Here's your logo."

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.376
Then I got a call
from one of the architects,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.256
a guy named Richard Lewis,
and he says, "I've got a problem.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.296
You're the graphics guy.
Can you solve it?"

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.536
And I said, OK, sure."

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.136
And he said, "The problem is
that there's a space

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.976
between the shelf and the ceiling."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.336
So that sounds like
an architectural issue to me,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.456
not a graphic design issue,
so I'm, "Go on."

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.136
And Richard says, "Well,
the top shelf has to be low enough

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.376
for the kid to reach it,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
but I'm in a big old building,
and the ceilings are really high,

00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:37.496
so actually I've got
all this space up there

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.216
and I need something like a mural."

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.176
And I'm like, "Whoa,
you know, I'm a logo designer.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.336
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.976
I'm not a muralist."

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.376
And so he said, "But can't you
think of anything?"

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.776
So I said, "OK, what if we just
took pictures of the kids in the school

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.256
and just put them around
the top of the thing,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.616
and maybe that could work."

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.496
And my wife is a photographer,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.456
and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.656
can you come to this school
in east New York, take these pictures?"

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.896
And she did,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.896
and if you go in Richard's library,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.776
which is one of the first that opened,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.896
it has this glorious frieze
of, like, the heroes of the school,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.616
oversized, looking down

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.656
into the little dollhouse
of the real library, right?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.496
And the kids were great,
hand-selected by the principals

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.296
and the librarian.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.576
It just kind of created
this heroic atmosphere in this library,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.096
this very dignified setting below
and the joy of the children above.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.456
So naturally all the other librarians
in the other schools see this

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.416
and they said, well, we want murals too.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.736
And I'm like, OK.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.656
So then I think, well,
it can't be the same mural every time,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.736
so Dorothy did another one,
and then she did another one,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.376
but then we needed more help,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.256
so I called an illustrator I knew
named Lynn Pauley,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.216
and Lynn did these beautiful
paintings of the kids.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.576
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin
at a place called Automatic Design.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.400
He did these amazing collages.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.296
We had Rafael Esquer

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.176
do these great silhouettes.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.376
He would work with the kids,
asking for words,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.976
and then based on those prompts,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.696
come up with this little,
delirious kind of constellation

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.776
of silhouettes
of things that are in books.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.376
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.496
and had them talk
about their favorite books

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.776
and he put their testimony
as a frieze up there.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.056
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.376
and they did this amazing
manga-style statement,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.856
"Everyone who is honest is interesting,"

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.736
that goes all the way around.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.136
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.536
did a whole series of things

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.576
where he embedded books
into the faces and characters

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.736
and images and places
that you find in the books.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.799
And then even Maira Kalman

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.655
did this amazing cryptic installation
of objects and words

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.856
that kind of go all around
and will fascinate students

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.456
for as long as it's up there.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.136
So this was really satisfying,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:53.056
and basically my role here was reading
a series of dimensions to these artists,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.336
and I would say,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.056
"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.296
Let me know if you have
any problem with that."

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.536
And they would go and install these.
It just was the greatest thing.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.856
But the greatest thing, actually, was --

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.096
Every once in a while,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.336
I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail
made of construction paper,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.656
and it would say, "You are invited
to the opening of our new library."

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.056
So you'd go to the library,
say, you'd go to PS10,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.296
and you'd go inside.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.096
There'd be balloons,
there'd be a student ambassador,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.256
there'd be speeches that were read,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.176
poetry that was written
specifically for the opening,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.136
dignitaries would present people
with certificates,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.776
and the whole thing
was just a delirious, fun party.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
So I loved going to these things.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.416
I would stand there dressed like this,
obviously not belonging,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.107
and someone would say,
"What are you doing here, mister?"

00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:40.296
And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team
that designed this place."

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.225
And they'd said, "You do these shelves?"

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.656
And I said, "No."
"You took the pictures up above."

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.896
"No."

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.136
"Well, what did you do?"

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.616
"You know when you came in?
The sign over the door?"

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.056
"The sign that says library?"

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.096
(Laughter)

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.336
"Yeah, I did that!"

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.480
And then they'd sort of go,
"OK. Nice work if you can get it."

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.296
So it was so satisfying
going to these little openings

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.056
despite the fact that I was
kind of largely ignored or humiliated,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.256
but it was actually fun
going to the openings,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.976
so I decided that I wanted
to get the people in my office

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.456
who had worked on these projects,
get the illustrators and photographers,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.176
and I said, why don't we rent a van

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.576
and drive around
the five boroughs of New York

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.616
and see how many we could hit at one time.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.496
And eventually there were
going to be 60 of these libraries,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.296
so we probably got to see
maybe half a dozen in one long day.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.256
And the best thing of all
was meeting these librarians

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.856
who kind of were running these,
took possession of these places

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.456
like their private stage
upon which they were invited

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.416
to mesmerize their students
and bring the books to life,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.976
and it was just
this really exciting experience

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.816
for all of us to actually
see these things in action.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.376
So we spent a long day doing this

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.216
and we were in the very last library.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.056
It was still winter,
because it got dark early,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.296
and the librarian says,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.016
"I'm about to close down.
So really nice having you here.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.176
Hey, wait a second, do you want to see
how I turn off the lights?"

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.496
I'm like, "OK."

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.016
And she said, "I have
this special way that I do it."

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.296
And then she showed me.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.776
What she did was she turned out
every light one by one by one by one,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.856
and the last light she left on

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.776
was the light that illuminated
the kids' faces,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.656
and she said, "That's the last light
I turn off every night,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.256
because I like to remind myself
why I come to work."

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.136
So when I started this whole thing,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.351
remember, it was just
about designing that logo

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.376
and being clever, come up with a new name?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.976
The unintended consequence here,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.816
which I would like to take credit for

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.056
and like to think I can think through
the experience to that extent,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.296
but I can't.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.296
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,
as far as I could reach with my own hands.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.896
Instead, way off in the distance

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.176
was a librarian

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.136
who was going to find
the chain of consequences

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.576
that we had set in motion,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.096
a source of inspiration

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.496
so that she in this case
could do her work really well.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.896
40,000 kids a year
are affected by these libraries.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.376
They've been happening
for more than 10 years now,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.936
so those librarians have kind of turned on
a generation of children to books

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.456
and so it's been a thrill to find out

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.216
that sometimes unintended consequences
are the best consequences.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.456
Thank you very much.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.360
(Applause)
