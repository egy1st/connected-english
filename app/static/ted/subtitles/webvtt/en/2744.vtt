00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.780
[His Holiness Pope Francis
Filmed in Vatican City

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.300
First shown at TED2017]

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.980
Good evening – or, good morning,
I am not sure what time it is there.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.540
Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled
to be participating in your conference.

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:24.460
I very much like its title
– "The Future You" –

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.380
because, while looking at tomorrow,
it invites us to open a dialogue today,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.820
to look at the future through a "you."

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:40.530
"The Future You:"

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.820
the future is made of yous,
it is made of encounters,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.220
because life flows
through our relations with others.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.356
Quite a few years of life

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.876
have strengthened my conviction

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.900
that each and everyone's existence
is deeply tied to that of others:

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:14.439
life is not time merely passing by,
life is about interactions.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.620
As I meet, or lend an ear
to those who are sick,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.356
to the migrants
who face terrible hardships

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380
in search of a brighter future,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.300
to prison inmates who carry
a hell of pain inside their hearts,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.060
and to those, many of them young,
who cannot find a job,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.740
I often find myself wondering:

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.555
"Why them and not me?"

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:52.928
I, myself, was born
in a family of migrants;

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.956
my father, my grandparents,
like many other Italians,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.036
left for Argentina

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.540
and met the fate of those
who are left with nothing.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.140
I could have very well ended up
among today's "discarded" people.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.617
And that's why I always ask myself,
deep in my heart:

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.919
"Why them and not me?"

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.716
First and foremost, I would love it
if this meeting could help to remind us

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.580
that we all need each other,

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.058
none of us is an island,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.500
an autonomous and independent "I,"
separated from the other,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.340
and we can only build the future
by standing together, including everyone.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.156
We don’t think about it often,
but everything is connected,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
and we need to restore
our connections to a healthy state.

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:04.702
Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.796
against my brother or my sister,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.876
the open wound that was never cured,
the offense that was never forgiven,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.916
the rancor that is only going to hurt me,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.242
are all instances of a fight
that I carry within me,

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.956
a flare deep in my heart
that needs to be extinguished

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.660
before it goes up in flames,
leaving only ashes behind.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.540
Many of us, nowadays,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.180
seem to believe that a happy future
is something impossible to achieve.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100
While such concerns
must be taken very seriously,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.295
they are not invincible.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.780
They can be overcome when we don't lock
our door to the outside world.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.540
Happiness can only be discovered

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.900
as a gift of harmony between the whole
and each single component.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.020
Even science – and you know it
better than I do –

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.756
points to an understanding of reality

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.780
as a place where every element connects
and interacts with everything else.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
And this brings me to my second message.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.540
How wonderful would it be

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:30.780
if the growth of scientific
and technological innovation

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.660
would come along with more equality
and social inclusion.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.940
How wonderful would it be,
while we discover faraway planets,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.441
to rediscover the needs of the brothers
and sisters orbiting around us.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.476
How wonderful would it be if solidarity,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.020
this beautiful and, at times,
inconvenient word,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.916
were not simply reduced to social work,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.596
and became, instead, the default attitude

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.380
in political, economic
and scientific choices,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.236
as well as in the relationships
among individuals, peoples and countries.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.268
Only by educating people
to a true solidarity

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:26.968
will we be able to overcome

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:30.339
the "culture of waste,"

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.820
which doesn't concern only food and goods

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.076
but, first and foremost, the people

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.180
who are cast aside
by our techno-economic systems

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.420
which, without even realizing it,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.066
are now putting products
at their core, instead of people.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.340
Solidarity is a term that many wish
to erase from the dictionary.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.700
Solidarity, however,
is not an automatic mechanism.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.900
It cannot be programmed or controlled.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.660
It is a free response born
from the heart of each and everyone.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.340
Yes, a free response!

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.436
When one realizes

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.196
that life, even in the middle
of so many contradictions, is a gift,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.940
that love is the source
and the meaning of life,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.883
how can they withhold their urge
to do good to another fellow being?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.836
In order to do good,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.020
we need memory, we need courage
and we need creativity.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.180
And I know that TED
gathers many creative minds.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.137
Yes, love does require
a creative, concrete

00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:05.990
and ingenious attitude.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.841
Good intentions and conventional formulas,

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:18.265
so often used to appease
our conscience, are not enough.

00:07:19.036 --> 00:07:22.276
Let us help each other,
all together, to remember

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.940
that the other is not
a statistic or a number.

00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:29.620
The other has a face.

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:34.569
The "you" is always a real presence,

00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:37.756
a person to take care of.

00:07:41.454 --> 00:07:46.836
There is a parable Jesus told
to help us understand the difference

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:53.690
between those who'd rather not be bothered
and those who take care of the other.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.320
I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.580
When Jesus was asked:
"Who is my neighbor?" -

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.660
namely, "Who should I take care of?" -

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.037
he told this story, the story of a man

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:20.900
who had been assaulted, robbed,
beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.420
Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
two very influential people of the time,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.620
walked past him without stopping to help.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.698
After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.

00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:46.156
Seeing the injured man
lying on the ground,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.620
he did not ignore him
as if he weren't even there.

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:54.673
Instead, he felt compassion for this man,

00:08:55.775 --> 00:09:02.747
which compelled him to act
in a very concrete manner.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.190
He poured oil and wine
on the wounds of the helpless man,

00:09:09.052 --> 00:09:10.956
brought him to a hostel

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.300
and paid out of his pocket
for him to be assisted.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.700
The story of the Good Samaritan
is the story of today’s humanity.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.676
People's paths are riddled with suffering,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.700
as everything is centered around money,
and things, instead of people.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.636
And often there is this habit, by people
who call themselves "respectable,"

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.235
of not taking care of the others,

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:48.720
thus leaving behind thousands
of human beings, or entire populations,

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:51.040
on the side of the road.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.248
Fortunately, there are also those
who are creating a new world

00:09:58.272 --> 00:10:03.500
by taking care of the other,
even out of their own pockets.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.421
Mother Teresa actually said:

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:13.302
"One cannot love,
unless it is at their own expense."

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.450
We have so much to do,
and we must do it together.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.600
But how can we do that
with all the evil we breathe every day?

00:10:26.957 --> 00:10:28.408
Thank God,

00:10:28.432 --> 00:10:32.766
no system can nullify our desire
to open up to the good,

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.809
to compassion and to our capacity
to react against evil,

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.269
all of which stem
from deep within our hearts.

00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:40.717
Now you might tell me,

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.436
"Sure, these are beautiful words,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.198
but I am not the Good Samaritan,
nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta."

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:52.264
On the contrary: we are precious,
each and every one of us.

00:10:52.661 --> 00:10:57.490
Each and every one of us
is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.236
Through the darkness of today's conflicts,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.796
each and every one of us
can become a bright candle,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.978
a reminder that light
will overcome darkness,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.190
and never the other way around.

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:21.113
To Christians,
the future does have a name,

00:11:21.877 --> 00:11:24.017
and its name is Hope.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.980
Feeling hopeful does not mean
to be optimistically naïve

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.700
and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.916
Hope is the virtue of a heart

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.996
that doesn't lock itself into darkness,
that doesn't dwell on the past,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.380
does not simply get by in the present,
but is able to see a tomorrow.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.156
Hope is the door
that opens onto the future.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.436
Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.700
that, with time,
will develop into a large tree.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.180
It is like some invisible yeast
that allows the whole dough to grow,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.180
that brings flavor to all aspects of life.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.988
And it can do so much,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.801
because a tiny flicker of light
that feeds on hope

00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:29.340
is enough to shatter
the shield of darkness.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:35.396
A single individual
is enough for hope to exist,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.604
and that individual can be you.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.194
And then there will be another "you,"
and another "you,"

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:48.583
and it turns into an "us."

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:53.495
And so, does hope begin
when we have an "us?"

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:54.663
No.

00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:56.307
Hope began with one "you."

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.890
When there is an "us,"
there begins a revolution.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.676
The third message
I would like to share today

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.940
is, indeed, about revolution:
the revolution of tenderness.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.700
And what is tenderness?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.156
It is the love that comes close
and becomes real.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.356
It is a movement
that starts from our heart

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.060
and reaches the eyes,
the ears and the hands.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.980
Tenderness means to use
our eyes to see the other,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.321
our ears to hear the other,

00:13:35.345 --> 00:13:41.629
to listen to the children, the poor,
those who are afraid of the future.

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:47.396
To listen also to the silent cry
of our common home,

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.540
of our sick and polluted earth.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.860
Tenderness means to use
our hands and our heart

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.580
to comfort the other,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.420
to take care of those in need.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.286
Tenderness is the language
of the young children,

00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:10.656
of those who need the other.

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:16.956
A child’s love for mom and dad

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.900
grows through their touch, their gaze,
their voice, their tenderness.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.036
I like when I hear parents

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.860
talk to their babies,
adapting to the little child,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.660
sharing the same level of communication.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.740
This is tenderness:
being on the same level as the other.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.620
God himself descended into Jesus
to be on our level.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.140
This is the same path
the Good Samaritan took.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.220
This is the path that Jesus himself took.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.250
He lowered himself,

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.356
he lived his entire human existence

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.060
practicing the real,
concrete language of love.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.756
Yes, tenderness is the path of choice

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.820
for the strongest,
most courageous men and women.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.100
Tenderness is not weakness;
it is fortitude.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.180
It is the path of solidarity,
the path of humility.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.140
Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.676
the more powerful you are,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.660
the more your actions
will have an impact on people,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.420
the more responsible you are
to act humbly.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:54.980
If you don’t, your power will ruin you,
and you will ruin the other.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.083
There is a saying in Argentina:

00:16:00.107 --> 00:16:04.894
"Power is like drinking gin
on an empty stomach."

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:14.260
You feel dizzy, you get drunk,
you lose your balance,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.180
and you will end up hurting yourself
and those around you,

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.460
if you don’t connect your power
with humility and tenderness.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.500
Through humility and concrete love,
on the other hand,

00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:39.164
power – the highest, the strongest one –
becomes a service, a force for good.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.740
The future of humankind isn't exclusively
in the hands of politicians,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.820
of great leaders, of big companies.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.236
Yes, they do hold
an enormous responsibility.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.076
But the future is, most of all,
in the hands of those people

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.593
who recognize the other as a "you"

00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:06.271
and themselves as part of an "us."

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:10.220
We all need each other.

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:15.556
And so, please, think of me
as well with tenderness,

00:17:16.153 --> 00:17:19.527
so that I can fulfill the task
I have been given

00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:21.973
for the good of the other,

00:17:21.998 --> 00:17:25.336
of each and every one, of all of you,

00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:27.436
of all of us.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.748
Thank you.
