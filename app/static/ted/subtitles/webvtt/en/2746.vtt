WEBVTT

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:08.058
Palms sweaty,

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:09.532
heart racing,

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.005
stomach in knots.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.879
You can't cry for help.

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:15.046
Not only is your throat
too tight to breathe,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.900
but it'd be so embarrassing.

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.093
No, you aren't being stalked by a monster,

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.309
you're speaking in public,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.075
a fate some deem worse than death.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.004
See, when you're dead, you feel nothing;

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.401
at a podium, you feel stage fright.

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:34.477
But at some point
we've all had to communicate

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.679
in front of people,

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:37.464
so you have to try and overcome it.

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:40.685
To start, understand what stage fright is.

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:42.854
Humans, social animals that we are,

00:00:42.878 --> 00:00:44.953
are wired to worry about reputation.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.695
Public speaking can threaten it.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.841
Before a speech, you fret,

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.667
"What if people think I'm
awful and I'm an idiot?"

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.644
That fear of being seen as an awful idiot

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:54.877
is a threat reaction

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.568
from a primitive part of your brain

00:00:56.592 --> 00:00:58.187
that's very hard to control.

00:00:58.211 --> 00:00:59.831
It's the fight or flight response,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.348
a self-protective process
seen in a range of animals,

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.946
most of which don't give speeches.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.435
But we have a wise partner

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:07.852
in the study of freaking out.

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.945
Charles Darwin tested fight or flight

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.333
at the London Zoo snake exhibit.

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:13.843
He wrote in his diary,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:17.239
"My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:18.973
which had never been experienced."

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:20.426
He concluded that his response

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.128
was an ancient reaction unaffected

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:24.259
by the nuances of modern civilization.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:25.903
So, to your conscious modern mind,

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:27.139
it's a speech.

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:28.476
To the rest of your brain,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.613
built up to code
with the law of the jungle,

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.640
when you perceive
the possible consequences

00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:33.860
of blowing a speech,

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.313
it's time to run for your life

00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:36.487
or fight to the death.

00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:52.764
Your hypothalamus, common
to all vertebrates,

00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:54.708
triggers your pituitary gland to secrete

00:01:54.732 --> 00:01:56.504
the hormone ACTH,

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:57.750
making your adrenal gland

00:01:57.774 --> 00:01:59.704
shoot adrenaline into your blood.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.749
Your neck and back tense up, you slouch.

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.092
Your legs and hand shake

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:04.919
as your muscles prepare for attack.

00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:06.085
You sweat.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.348
Your blood pressure jumps.

00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:08.568
Your digestion shuts down

00:02:08.592 --> 00:02:10.354
to maximize the delivery of nutrients

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:12.476
and oxygen to muscles and vital organs,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800
so you get dry mouth, butterflies.

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:16.266
Your pupils dilate,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.077
it's hard to read anything up close,

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:19.260
like your notes,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:20.761
but long range is easy.

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.480
That's how stage fright works.

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:23.766
How do we fight it?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.959
First, perspective.

00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:27.342
This isn't all in your head.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.539
It's a natural, hormonal,
full body reaction

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:32.233
by an autonomic nervous
system on autopilot.

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:35.197
And genetics play a huge
role in social anxiety.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.599
John Lennon played live
thousands of times.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.759
Each time he vomited beforehand.

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:41.022
Some people are just wired

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:43.126
to feel more scared performing in public.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.685
Since stage fright
is natural and inevitable,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.418
focus on what you can control.

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:49.454
Practice a lot,

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:50.636
starting long before

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.286
in an environment similar
to the real performance.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.677
Practicing any task
increases your familiarity

00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:57.177
and reduces anxiety,

00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.041
so when it's time to speak in public,

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.465
you're confident in yourself
and the task at hand.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.386
Steve Jobs rehearsed his epic speeches

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.611
for hundreds of hours,

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:05.970
starting weeks in advance.

00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:07.478
If you know what you're saying,

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.197
you'll feed off the crowd's energy

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.959
instead of letting your hypothalamus
convince your body it's about to be lunch

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:14.195
for a pack of predators.

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.959
But hey, the vertebrate hypothalamus

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.351
has had millions of years
more practice than you.

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:19.725
Just before you go on stage,

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:20.903
it's time to fight dirty

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:22.087
and trick your brain.

00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.033
Stretch your arms up and breath deeply.

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.772
This makes your hypothalamus trigger

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:26.984
a relaxation response.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:29.976
Stage fright usually hits hardest
right before a presentation,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.286
so take that last minute
to stretch and breathe.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.020
You approach the Mic, voice clear,

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:35.390
body relaxed.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.015
Your well-prepared speech
convinces the wild crowd

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.012
you're a charismatic genius.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.239
How?

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:42.835
You didn't overcome stage fright,

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.055
you adapted to it.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.530
And to the fact that no matter

00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:46.866
how civilized you may seem,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.065
in part of your brain,

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.375
you're still a wild animal,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.600
a profound, well-spoken wild animal.
