00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:09.415
If you tried to pay for something
with a piece of paper,

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.350
you might run into some trouble.

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:15.311
Unless, of course, the piece of paper
was a hundred dollar bill.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:18.890
But what is it that makes that bill
so much more interesting and valuable

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:20.769
than other pieces of paper?

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:23.421
After all, there's not much
you can do with it.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.055
You can't eat it.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.556
You can't build things with it.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.272
And burning it is actually illegal.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.460
So what's the big deal?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.991
Of course, you probably know the answer.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.410
A hundred dollar bill
is printed by the government

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.460
and designated as official currency,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.511
while other pieces of paper are not.

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:42.332
But that's just what makes them legal.

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:45.261
What makes a hundred dollar bill
valuable, on the other hand,

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.546
is how many or few of them are around.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.472
Throughout history, most currency,
including the US dollar,

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:53.499
was linked to valuable commodities

00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:55.352
and the amount of it in circulation

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:58.372
depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.930
But after the US abolished
this system in 1971,

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.762
the dollar became
what is known as fiat money,

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.197
meaning not linked
to any external resource

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.159
but relying instead solely
on government policy

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:13.620
to decide how much currency to print.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.582
Which branch of our government
sets this policy?

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:19.572
The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial?

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.044
The surprising answer is:
none of the above!

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:26.801
In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.552
or the Fed,

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:32.595
made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.930
Its board of governors,

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:36.979
which is appointed by the president
and confirmed by the Senate,

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:38.097
reports to Congress,

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.595
and all the Fed's profit
goes into the US Treasury.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.572
But to keep the Fed from being influenced

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:45.762
by the day-to-day
vicissitudes of politics,

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:49.238
it is not under the direct control
of any branch of government.

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:52.678
Why doesn't the Fed just decide
to print infinite hundred dollar bills

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:54.227
to make everyone happy and rich?

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:56.871
Well, because then the bills
wouldn't be worth anything.

00:01:56.895 --> 00:01:58.996
Think about the purpose of currency,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.832
which is to be exchanged
for goods and services.

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.047
If the total amount
of currency in circulation

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.794
increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy,

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:10.675
then each individual piece will be able

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.342
to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.204
This is called inflation.

00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:16.652
On the other hand,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:18.438
if the money supply remains the same,

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:20.594
while more goods
and services are produced,

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.564
each dollar's value would increase

00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:24.817
in a process known as deflation.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.616
So which is worse?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.823
Too much inflation

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.133
means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow,

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:33.156
making you want to spend it right away.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.013
While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption,

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:39.875
or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.620
raising their prices

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.481
and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation.

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:49.096
But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.009
and a decrease in consumer spending

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.567
would reduce business profits,

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.930
leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending,

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.227
causing the economy to keep shrinking.

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.894
So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous,

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:06.806
a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.234
The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:13.597
to determine how much currency
should be in circulation,

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:15.575
including previous rates of inflation,

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.881
international trends,
and the unemployment rate.

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.443
Like in the story of Goldilocks,

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.325
they need to get the numbers just right

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.921
in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.670
without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels.

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.044
The Fed not only determines

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:32.219
how much that paper
in your wallet is worth

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:34.962
but also your chances
of getting or keeping the job

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.325
where you earn it.
