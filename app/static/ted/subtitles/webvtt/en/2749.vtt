00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.070
Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments,

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:20.269
there are fireworks going off
all over their brain?

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:22.856
On the outside,
they may look calm and focused,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.843
reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.354
But inside their brains,
there's a party going on.

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.385
How do we know this?

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.201
Well, in the last few decades,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.696
neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.329
in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:43.441
with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.694
When people are hooked up
to these machines,

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:48.600
tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems,

00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:53.010
each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.292
But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music,

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.276
they saw fireworks.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.171
Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.820
as they processed the sound,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.841
took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.028
and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience.

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:13.019
And our brains do all this work
in the split second

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:17.385
between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.921
But when scientists turned
from observing the brains

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.611
of music listeners to those of musicians,

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:25.892
the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:29.447
It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.429
in some pretty interesting activities,

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:35.494
playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout.

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:38.682
The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up,

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:41.614
simultaneously processing
different information

00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:45.508
in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.860
But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight?

00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:51.795
The research is still fairly new,

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.476
but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.928
Playing a musical instrument

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:59.293
engages practically every area
of the brain at once,

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:03.315
especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:07.757
As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.690
strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.595
to other activities.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.120
The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:19.704
is that the latter requires
fine motor skills,

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:22.781
which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.113
It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision,

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:28.382
in which the left hemisphere
is more involved,

00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:31.941
with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:34.280
For these reasons,
playing music has been found

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:38.860
to increase the volume and activity
in the brain's corpus callosum,

00:02:38.884 --> 00:02:41.325
the bridge between the two hemispheres,

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.190
allowing messages to get across the brain
faster and through more diverse routes.

00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:48.667
This may allow musicians to solve problems

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:52.316
more effectively and creatively,
in both academic and social settings.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.216
Because making music also involves
crafting and understanding

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.315
its emotional content and message,

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.212
musicians often have higher levels
of executive function,

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:04.237
a category of interlinked tasks

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:07.896
that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.231
and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:16.478
This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.425
And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions,

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.454
creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:29.208
Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.970
to give each memory multiple tags,

00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:34.310
such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag,

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.850
an audio tag, and a contextual tag,

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.579
like a good Internet search engine.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:42.659
How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music,

00:03:42.683 --> 00:03:45.148
as opposed to, say, sports or painting?

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:47.545
Or could it be
that people who go into music

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.474
were already smarter to begin with?

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:52.679
Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far,

00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:55.353
they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:57.330
of learning to play a musical instrument

00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:01.709
are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.244
And several randomized studies
of participants,

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.670
who showed the same levels

00:04:05.694 --> 00:04:09.047
of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start,

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.855
found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.183
showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.908
This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:22.565
has advanced our understanding
of mental function,

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:25.501
revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay

00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:28.493
that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.
