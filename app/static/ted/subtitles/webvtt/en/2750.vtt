00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.999
One of the most remarkable aspects
of the human brain

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:13.651
is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:16.331
Among the hardest patterns
we've tried to understand

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:20.765
is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.272
The German physicist
Werner Heisenberg said,

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:27.357
"When I meet God,
I'm going to ask him two questions:

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.818
why relativity and why turbulence?

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:34.908
I really believe he will have
an answer for the first."

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:38.280
As difficult as turbulence is
to understand mathematically,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.170
we can use art to depict the way it looks.

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:47.284
In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:51.635
from the window of his room
at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.564
in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence,

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:56.816
where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.415
in a psychotic episode.

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:02.032
In "The Starry Night,"
his circular brushstrokes

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:07.803
create a night sky filled
with swirling clouds and eddies of stars.

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:11.724
Van Gogh and other Impressionists
represented light in a different way

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:12.955
than their predecessors,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.749
seeming to capture
its motion, for instance,

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.836
across sun-dappled waters,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.506
or here in star light
that twinkles and melts

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.919
through milky waves of blue night sky.

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:27.391
The effect is caused by luminance,

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:30.916
the intensity of the light
in the colors on the canvas.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.608
The more primitive part
of our visual cortex,

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:37.554
which sees light contrast
and motion, but not color,

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.603
will blend two differently
colored areas together

00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:42.949
if they have the same luminance.

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:45.328
But our brains' primate subdivision

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:48.482
will see the contrasting colors
without blending.

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.433
With these two interpretations
happening at once,

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:57.005
the light in many Impressionist works
seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly.

00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:00.200
That's how this
and other Impressionist works

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.042
use quickly executed
prominent brushstrokes

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:06.733
to capture something strikingly real
about how light moves.

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:11.182
Sixty years later, Russian
mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:13.763
furthered our mathematical
understanding of turbulence

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:18.133
when he proposed that energy
in a turbulent fluid at length R

00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:22.467
varies in proportion to
the 5/3rds power of R.

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.444
Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.632
was remarkably close
to the way turbulent flow works,

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:29.788
although a complete description
of turbulence

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.576
remains one of the unsolved
problems in physics.

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:37.491
A turbulent flow is self-similar
if there is an energy cascade.

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:41.099
In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies,

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:43.174
which do likewise at other scales.

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:47.204
Examples of this include
Jupiter's Great Red Spot,

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:50.568
cloud formations
and interstellar dust particles.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.885
In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.907
scientists saw the eddies of a distant
cloud of dust and gas around a star,

00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:02.857
and it reminded them
of Van Gogh's "Starry Night."

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:07.169
This motivated scientists
from Mexico, Spain and England

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:10.570
to study the luminance
in Van Gogh's paintings in detail.

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:15.676
They discovered that there is a distinct
pattern of turbulent fluid structures

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.014
close to Kolmogorov's equation
hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings.

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:23.200
The researchers digitized the paintings,

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.946
and measured how brightness varies
between any two pixels.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.665
From the curves measured
for pixel separations,

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.431
they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.137
behave remarkably similar
to fluid turbulence.

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:41.974
His self-portrait with a pipe, from
a calmer period in Van Gogh's life,

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.860
showed no sign of this correspondence.

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:46.787
And neither did other artists' work

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.337
that seemed equally
turbulent at first glance,

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.977
like Munch's "The Scream."

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.672
While it's too easy to say
Van Gogh's turbulent genius

00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:57.068
enabled him to depict turbulence,

00:03:57.092 --> 00:04:02.002
it's also far too difficult to accurately
express the rousing beauty of the fact

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.453
that in a period of intense suffering,

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.907
Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:10.336
one of the most supremely
difficult concepts

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.597
nature has ever brought before mankind,

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:15.736
and to unite his unique mind's eye

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.926
with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.
