00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.567
It's a common saying
that elephants never forget,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:14.884
but these magnificent animals are more
than giant walking hard drives.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.712
The more we learn about elephants,

00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.178
the more it appears
that their impressive memory

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:22.135
is only one aspect
of an incredible intelligence

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.821
that makes them
some of the most social, creative,

00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:27.558
and benevolent creatures on Earth.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.498
Unlike many proverbs,
the one about elephant memory

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.567
is scientifically accurate.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.091
Elephants know every member
in their herd,

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.836
able to recognize as many as 30
companions by sight or smell.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.689
This is a great help when migrating

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.318
or encountering
other potentially hostile elephants.

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:49.688
They also remember and distinguish
particular cues that signal danger

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:53.820
and can recall important locations long
after their last visit.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.402
But it's the memories unrelated
to survival that are the most fascinating.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:01.875
Elephants remember
not only their herd companions

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:06.051
but other creatures who have made
a strong impression on them.

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.250
In one case, two circus elephants
that had briefly performed together

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.866
rejoiced when crossing paths
23 years later.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.622
This recognition isn't limited to others
of their species.

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:23.339
Elephants have also recognized humans
they've bonded with after decades apart.

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:28.556
All of this shows that elephant memory
goes beyond responses to stimuli.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:31.316
Looking inside their heads,
we can see why.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:34.770
The elephant boasts the largest brain
of any land mammal,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.826
as well as an impressive
encephalization quotient.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.759
This is the size of the brain
relative to what we'd expect

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.252
for an animal's body size,

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:46.785
and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high
as a chimpanzee's.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.740
And despite the distant relation,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.105
convergent evolution has made it
remarkably similar to the human brain,

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.262
with as many neurons and synapses

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:59.821
and a highly developed hippocampus
and cerebral cortex.

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:04.047
It is the hippocampus, strongly associated
with emotion, that aids recollection

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:08.673
by encoding important experiences
into long-term memories.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.394
The ability to distinguish this importance
makes elephant memory

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:16.828
a complex and adaptable faculty
beyond rote memorization.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.949
It's what allows elephants who survived
a drought in their youth

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.790
to recognize its warning signs
in adulthood,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.029
which is why clans with older matriarchs
have higher survival rates.

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.672
Unfortunately, it's also what makes
elephants one of the few non-human animals

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.863
to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.437
The cerebral cortex, on the other hand,
enables problem solving,

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:42.003
which elephants display
in many creative ways.

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.464
They also tackle problems cooperatively,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.079
sometimes even outwitting the researchers
and manipulating their partners.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.086
And they've grasped basic arithmetic,
keeping track of the relative amounts

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:56.722
of fruit in two baskets
after multiple changes.

00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:59.625
The rare combination of memory
and problem solving

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.061
can explain some of elephants'
most clever behaviors,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:06.068
but it doesn't explain some of the things
we're just beginning to learn

00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:07.983
about their mental lives.

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:12.078
Elephants communicate using everything
from body signals and vocalizations,

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:15.809
to infrasound rumbles that can be heard
kilometers away.

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:21.348
And their understanding of syntax suggests that
they have their own language and grammar.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:25.982
This sense of language may even go beyond
simple communication.

00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:29.033
Elephants create art by carefully
choosing and combining

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.648
different colors and elements.

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:36.656
They can also recognize twelve distinct
tones of music and recreate melodies.

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:39.205
And yes, there is an elephant band.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.103
But perhaps the most amazing thing
about elephants

00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:45.507
is a capacity even more important
than cleverness:

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:50.582
their sense of empathy,
altruism, and justice.

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:54.457
Elephants are the only non-human animals
to mourn their dead,

00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:58.241
performing burial rituals
and returning to visit graves.

00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.577
They have shown concern
for other species, as well.

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.353
One working elephant refused
to set a log down into a hole

00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:07.541
where a dog was sleeping,

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.428
while elephants encountering injured
humans have sometimes stood guard

00:04:11.428 --> 00:04:14.637
and gently comforted them
with their trunk.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.759
On the other hand, elephant attacks
on human villages

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.407
have usually occurred right after
massive poachings or cullings,

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:23.708
suggesting deliberate revenge.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:25.711
When we consider all this evidence,

00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.676
along with the fact that elephants
are one of the few species

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:31.208
who can recognize themselves in a mirror,

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.934
it's hard to escape the conclusion

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:37.224
that they are conscious,
intelligent, and emotional beings.

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:42.194
Unfortunately, humanity's treatment
of elephants does not reflect this,

00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:45.924
as they continue to suffer
from habitat destruction in Asia,

00:04:45.924 --> 00:04:50.807
ivory poaching in Africa,
and mistreatment in captivity worldwide.

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:53.069
Given what we now know about elephants

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.365
and what they continue to teach us
about animal intelligence,

00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:58.693
it is more important than ever to ensure

00:04:58.693 --> 00:05:03.697
that what the English poet John Donne
described as "nature's great masterpiece"

00:05:03.722 --> 00:05:06.766
does not vanish from the world's canvas.
