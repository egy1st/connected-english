00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:12.699
In 2008, something incredible happened:
a man was cured of HIV.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:18.378
In over 70 million HIV cases, 
that was a first and, so far, a last.

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:21.464
We don't yet understand exactly
how he was cured.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.774
We can cure people of various diseases,
such as malaria and hepatitis C,

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:28.307
so why can't we cure HIV?

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:31.555
Well, first let's examine 
how HIV infects people

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.672
and progresses into AIDS.

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.830
HIV spreads through 
exchanges of bodily fluids.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.293
Unprotected sex and contaminated needles
are the leading cause of transmission.

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:45.853
It, fortunately, cannot spread
through air, water, or casual contact.

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:49.614
Individuals of any age,
sexual orientation, gender and race

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:52.088
can contract HIV.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:57.096
Once inside the body, HIV infects cells
that are part of the immune system.

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:59.445
It particularly targets helper T cells,

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:03.555
which help defend the body against 
bacterial and fungal infections.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.670
HIV is a retrovirus,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.008
which means it can write its genetic code
into the genome of infected cells,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.483
co-opting them into making 
more copies of itself.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:15.789
During the first stage of HIV infection,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.167
the virus replicates 
within helper T cells,

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.971
destroying many of them in the process.

00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.372
During this stage, patients often 
experience flu-like symptoms,

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:27.203
but are typically 
not yet in mortal danger.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.837
However, for a period ranging 
from a few months to several years,

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:34.269
during which time the patient may look
and feel completely healthy,

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.891
the virus continues to replicate
and destroy T cells.

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.826
When T cell counts drop too low,

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:43.236
patients are in serious danger
of contracting deadly infections

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.674
that healthy immune systems
can normally handle.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:50.467
This stage of HIV infection
is known as AIDS.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:53.297
The good news is there are drugs
that are highly effective

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:55.036
at managing levels of HIV

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.620
and preventing T cell counts 
from getting low enough

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.868
for the disease to progress to AIDS.

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.089
With antiretroviral therapy,

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:06.490
most HIV-positive people can expect
to live long and healthy lives,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.157
and are much less likely to infect others.

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:11.600
However, there are two major catches.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.881
One is that HIV-positive patients 
must keep taking their drugs

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.509
for the rest of their lives.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.762
Without them, the virus can make 
a deadly comeback.

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:22.944
So, how do these drugs work?

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.894
The most commonly prescribed ones
prevent the viral genome from being copied

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:30.335
and incorporated into a host cell's DNA.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.323
Other drugs prevent the virus
from maturing or assembling,

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:37.985
causing HIV to be unable 
to infect new cells in the body.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:41.192
But HIV hides out somewhere
our current drugs cannot reach it:

00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:44.022
inside the DNA of healthy T cells.

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:47.746
Most T cells die shortly after 
being infected with HIV.

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.192
But in a tiny percentage,

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:52.630
the instructions for building more HIV
viruses lies dormant,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.363
sometimes for years.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:58.477
So even if we could wipe out every
HIV virus from an infected person's body,

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:02.618
one of those T cells could activate
and start spreading the virus again.

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:06.606
The other major catch is that not everyone
in the world has access to the therapies

00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:08.690
that could save their lives.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.730
In Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts
for over 70% of HIV patients worldwide,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.870
antiretrovirals reached only about one
in three HIV-positive patients in 2012.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.464
There is no easy answer to this problem.

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:25.355
A mix of political, economic 
and cultural barriers

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.894
makes effective prevention 
and treatment difficult.

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:34.549
And even in the U.S., HIV still claims
more than 10,000 lives per year.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.628
However, there is ample cause for hope.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:41.169
Researchers may be closer than ever
to developing a true cure.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.637
One research approach involves

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:47.963
using a drug to activate all cells 
harboring the HIV genetic information.

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:52.088
This would both destroy those cells
and flush the virus out into the open,

00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:54.328
where our current drugs are effective.

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.515
Another is looking to use genetic tools

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:01.301
to cut the HIV DNA 
out of cells genomes altogether.

00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.442
And while one cure out of 70 million cases
may seem like terrible odds,

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:09.013
one is immeasurably better than zero.

00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:11.352
We now know that a cure is possible,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:15.570
and that may give us what we need
to beat HIV for good.
