00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.047
In 1978, Louise Brown became 


00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:14.450
the world's first baby to be born
by in vitro fertilization, or IVF.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.780
Her birth revolutionized 
the field of reproductive medicine.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.931
Given that approximately one in eight
heterosexual couples

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.997
has difficulty conceiving,

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.172
and that homosexual couples
and single parents

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.804
often need clinical help to make a baby,

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:30.561
the demand for IVF has been growing.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:36.889
IVF is so common, that more than 5 million
babies have been born through this technology.

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:42.645
IVF works by mimicking the brilliant
design of sexual reproduction.

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:44.789
In order to understand IVF,

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.516
we first need to take a look 
at the natural process of baby making.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.788
Believe it or not, 
it all starts in the brain.

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:57.127
Roughly fifteen days 
before fertilization can happen,

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:02.612
the anterior pituitary gland secretes
follicle stimulating hormone, FSH,

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:05.476
which ripens a handful 
of follicles of the ovary

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.817
that then release estrogen.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.788
Each follicle contains one egg,

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:14.340
and on average, 
only one follicle becomes fully mature.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.295
As it grows and continues 
to release estrogen,

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:21.664
this hormone not only helps coordinate
growth and preparation of the uterus,

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:27.088
it also communicates to the brain
how well the follicle is developing.

00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:29.466
When the estrogen level is high enough,

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:35.378
the anterior pituitary releases a surge
of luteinizing hormone, LH,

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:37.213
which triggers ovulation

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:42.417
and causes the follicle to rupture
and release the egg.

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.468
Once the egg leaves the ovary,

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:49.179
it is directed into the Fallopian tube
by the finger-like fimbriae.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.681
If the egg is not fertilized 
by sperm within 24 hours,

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.807
the unfertilized egg will die,

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.266
and the entire system will reset itself,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:02.087
preparing to create a new egg
and uterine lining the following month.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.011
The egg is the largest cell in the body

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.473
and is protected by a thick, 
extracellular shell of sugar

00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:12.325
and protein called the zona pellucida.

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:16.576
The zona thwarts the entry and fusion
of more than one sperm,

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:19.978
the smallest cell in the body.

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:23.060
It takes a man two to three months
to make sperm,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.220
and the process constantly renews.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.856
Each ejaculation during sexual intercourse
releases more than 100 million sperm.

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:37.035
But only 100 or so will ultimately
make it to the proximity of the egg,

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:43.232
and only one will successfully penetrate
through the armor of the zona pellucida.

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:45.514
Upon successful fertilization,

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:48.756
the zygote immediately begins 
developing into an embryo,

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:52.006
and takes about three days
to reach the uterus.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.282
There, it requires 
another three or so days

00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:59.742
to implant firmly into the endometrium,
the inner lining of the uterus.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:02.895
Once implanted, the cells that 
are to become the placenta

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.037
secrete a hormone that signals
to the ovulated follicle

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:08.898
that there is a pregnancy in the uterus.

00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:12.403
This helps rescue that follicle,
now called the corpus luteum,

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:17.697
from degenerating as it normally would
do in that stage of the menstrual cycle.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.839
The corpus luteum is responsible
for producing the progesterone

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.594
required to maintain the pregnancy
until six to seven weeks of gestation,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.273
when the placenta develops
and takes over,

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:32.213
until the baby is born 
approximately 40 weeks later.

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:35.587
Now, how do you make a baby in a lab?

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:37.926
In patients undergoing IVF,

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:42.333
FSH is administered at levels
that are higher than naturally occuring

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.859
to cause a controlled 
overstimulation of the ovaries

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.599
so that they ultimately 
produce multiple eggs.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.462
The eggs are then retrieved 
just before ovulation would occur,

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.738
while the woman is under anesthesia,

00:03:55.738 --> 00:04:00.111
through an aspirating needle
that is guided by ultrasound.

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:05.029
Most sperm samples are produced
by masturbation.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:09.599
In the laboratory, the identified eggs
are stripped of surrounding cells

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.594
and prepared for fertilization 
in a petri dish.

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:16.851
Fertilization can occur 
by one of two techniques.

00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:20.307
In the first, the eggs are incubated
with thousands of sperm

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:24.725
and fertilization occurs naturally
over a few hours.

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.835
The second technique maximizes
certainty of fertilization

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:32.465
by using a needle 
to place a single sperm inside the egg.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:37.181
This is particularly useful when there is
a problem with the quality of the sperm.

00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:41.819
After fertilization, embryos can be 
further screened for genetic suitability,

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.480
frozen for later attempted pregnancies,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.687
or delivered into the woman's uterus
via catheter.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:53.913
Common convention is to transfer
the embryo three days after fertilization,

00:04:53.913 --> 00:04:56.542
when the embryo has eight cells,

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:01.137
or on day five, when
the embryo is called a blastocyst,

00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:03.769
and has hundreds of cells.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:08.717
If the woman's eggs are of poor quality
due to age or toxic exposures,

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:11.478
or have been removed due to cancer,

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.237
donor eggs may be used.

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:18.671
In the case that the intended mother
has a problematic uterus, or lacks one,

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:22.622
another woman, called 
the gestational carrier or surrogate,

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.448
can use her uterus to carry the pregnancy.

00:05:26.448 --> 00:05:28.378
To increase the odds of success,

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:32.330
which are as high as 40%
for a woman younger than 35,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.536
doctors sometimes transfer
multiple embryos at once,

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.512
which is why IVF results 
in twins and triplets

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:43.050
more often than natural pregnancies.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.003
However, most clinics seek to minimize
the chances of multiple pregnancies,

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:51.726
as they are riskier 
for mothers and babies.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:56.336
Millions of babies, like Louise Brown,
have been born from IVF

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:59.501
and have had normal, healthy lives.

00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:02.728
The long-term health consequences
of ovarian stimulation

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:05.879
with IVF medicines are less clear,

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.920
though so far, IVF seems safe for women.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.876
Because of better genetic testing,

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:13.714
delayed childbearing, 


00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:16.765
increased accessibility
and diminishing cost,

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:22.582
it's not inconceivable that artificial
baby making via IVF and related techniques

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:26.717
could outpace natural reproduction
in years to come.
