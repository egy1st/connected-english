00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:13.740
The constant thud underneath your feet,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.737
the constrained space,

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.607
and the monotony of going nowhere fast.

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:24.122
It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes,

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.183
and you wonder,

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:26.981
"Why am I torturing myself?

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.732
This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment."

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:35.102
Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.260
You see, in the 1800s,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.049
treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners.

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.974
At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad.

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:50.210
Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.706
and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.940
So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.533
and celebrities, like Charles Dickens,

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:06.432
sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.289
When their movement succeeded,

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.596
entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation,

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.720
such as the treadmill,
were introduced.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.664
Here's how the original version,

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:23.647
invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked.

00:01:23.647 --> 00:01:28.055
Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:29.258
As the wheel turned,

00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:33.600
the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440
similar to modern stepper machines.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.268
Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water,

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:41.879
crush grain,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.197
or power mills,

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:46.217
which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated.

00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:50.742
These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape,

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:53.157
and that added benefit of powering mills

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:58.291
helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:02.338
It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:04.270
It's estimated that, on average,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.416
prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills,

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.369
the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet.

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:17.352
14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point.

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:21.469
Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.322
Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America.

00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.245
Within a decade of its creation,

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:30.626
over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill,

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.678
and America, a similar amount.

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:36.471
Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.530
saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.261
not that prison guards seemed to care.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.848
In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:49.832
with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:55.654
the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror,"

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.121
a quote many still agree with.

00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:02.625
And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century,

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.930
when they were banned for being
excessively cruel

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.630
under the Prison's Act of 1898.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.618
But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance,

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:15.664
this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:20.321
In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S.,

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:26.133
and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:29.703
When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s,

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.241
the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight

00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:36.484
as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness,

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.607
and lose unwanted pounds,

00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:41.243
which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing.

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:44.390
And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.029
So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.427
a cruel and unusual punishment,

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:53.828
just be glad you can control
when you'll hop off.
