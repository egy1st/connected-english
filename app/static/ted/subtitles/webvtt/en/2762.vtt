00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.681
Way before the first selfie,

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.883
the ancient Greeks and Romans had a myth

00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:14.605
about someone a little too obsessed 
with his own image.

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:15.895
In one telling,

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:20.779
Narcissus was a handsome guy wandering
the world in search of someone to love.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.235
After rejecting a nymph named Echo,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.709
he caught a glimpse 
of his own reflection in a river,

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.511
and fell in love with it.

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:30.116
Unable to tear himself away,

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.944
Narcissus drowned.

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:37.040
A flower marked the spot of where he died,
and we call that flower the Narcissus.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.391
The myth captures 
the basic idea of narcissism,

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:44.180
elevated and sometimes 
detrimental self-involvement.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.274
But it's not just a personality type
that shows up in advice columns.

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:52.966
It's actually a set of traits classified
and studied by psychologists.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:58.772
The psychological definition of narcissism
is an inflated, grandiose self-image.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:02.119
To varying degrees, narcissists think
they're better looking,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.973
smarter,

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:05.233
and more important than other people,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.011
and that they deserve special treatment.

00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.767
Psychologists recognize two forms
of narcissism as a personality trait:

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.889
grandiose and vulnerable narcissism.

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:18.406
There's also narcissistic 
personality disorder,

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:22.066
a more extreme form,
which we'll return to shortly.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.801
Grandiose narcissism 
is the most familiar kind,

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:27.789
characterized by extroversion,

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:28.956
dominance,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.531
and attention seeking.

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.812
Grandiose narcissists pursue 
attention and power,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.457
sometimes as politicians,

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:36.457
celebrities,

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:38.290
or cultural leaders.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.636
Of course, not everyone who pursues
these positions of power is narcissistic.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.406
Many do it for very positive reasons,

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:46.082
like reaching their full potential,

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:48.491
or helping make people's lives better.

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.777
But narcissistic individuals seek power

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.773
for the status 
and attention that goes with it.

00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:57.919
Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissists
can be quiet and reserved.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.833
They have a strong sense of entitlement,

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.793
but are easily threatened or slighted.

00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:07.061
In either case, the dark side of
narcissism shows up over the long term.

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.991
Narcissists tend to act selfishly,

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.376
so narcissistic leaders may make risky
or unethical decisions,

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:19.144
and narcissistic partners may be dishonest
or unfaithful.

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:21.680
When their rosy view of themselves
is challenged,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.223
they can become resentful and aggressive.

00:02:24.223 --> 00:02:27.184
It's like a disease where the sufferers
feel pretty good,

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:29.505
but the people around them suffer.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:30.918
Taken to the extreme,

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:34.208
this behavior is classified 
as a psychological disorder

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.964
called narcissistic personality disorder.

00:02:36.964 --> 00:02:39.927
It affects one to two percent
of the population,

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.506
more commonly men.

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:44.664
It is also a diagnosis 
reserved for adults.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:48.145
Young people, especially children,
can be very self-centered,

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:51.491
but this might just be a normal
part of development.

00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:54.772
The fifth edition of the American
Psychiatric Association's

00:02:54.772 --> 00:02:57.311
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.858
describes several traits associated
with narcissistic personality disorder.

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.778
They include a grandiose view of oneself,

00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:06.157
problems with empathy,

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:07.773
a sense of entitlement,

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:10.804
and a need for admiration or attention.

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:13.542
What makes these trait a true
personality disorder

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:17.889
is that they take over people's lives
and cause significant problems.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.097
Imagine that instead of caring
for your spouse or children,

00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:24.429
you used them as a source
of attention or admiration.

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:26.102
Or imagine that instead of seeking

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:28.408
constructive feedback 
about your performance,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.797
you instead told everyone 
who tried to help you

00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:32.908
that they were wrong.

00:03:32.908 --> 00:03:35.230
So what causes narcissism?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.969
Twin studies show 
a strong genetic component,

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.023
although we don't know 
which genes are involved.

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.895
But environment matters, too.

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:45.240
Parents who put their child
on a pedestal

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.789
can foster grandiose narcissism.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:53.050
And cold, controlling parents
can contribute to vulnerable narcissism.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.259
Narcissism also seems to be higher

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.429
in cultures that value individuality
and self-promotion.

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.170
In the United States, for example,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.902
narcissism as a personality trait
has been rising since the 1970s,

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.991
when the communal focus of the 60s

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.150
gave way to the self-esteem movement

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.633
and a rise in materialism.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:17.078
More recently, social media has multiplied
the possibilities for self-promotion,

00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:18.371
though it's worth noting

00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.191
that there's no clear evidence
that social media causes narcissism.

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:27.764
Rather, it provides narcissists a means
to seek social status and attention.

00:04:27.764 --> 00:04:31.235
So can narcissists improve 
on those negative traits?

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:32.474
Yes!

00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:35.450
Anything that promotes honest reflection
on their own behavior

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.104
and caring for others,

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:42.116
like psychotherapy or practicing 
compassion towards others, can be helpful.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.172
The difficulty is it can be challenging

00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:46.712
for people with 
narcissistic personality disorder

00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:48.911
to keep working at self-betterment.

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:53.763
For a narcissist, self-reflection is hard
from an unflattering angle.
