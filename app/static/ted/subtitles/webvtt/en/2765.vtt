00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.090
Communicating underwater is challenging.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.650
Light and odors don't travel well,
so it's hard for animals to see or smell.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.840
But sound moves about four times
faster in water than in air,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
so in this dark environment,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.351
marine mammals often rely
on vocalization to communicate.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.057
That's why a chorus of sounds fills
the ocean.

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:32.822
Clicks,

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:33.522
pulses,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:34.544
whistles,

00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:35.431
groans,

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.281
boings,

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.080
cries,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.791
and trills, to name a few.

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.291
But the most famous parts of this
underwater symphony

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:48.111
are the evocative melodies, or songs,
composed by the world's largest mammals,

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:50.741
whales.

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.602
Whale songs are one of the most
sophisticated communication systems

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.472
in the animal kingdom.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.181
Only a few species are known to sing.

00:00:59.181 --> 00:00:59.924
Blue,

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:00.832
fin,

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:01.701
bowhead

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.181
minke whales,

00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.282
and of course humpback whales.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.032
These are all baleen whales

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:12.921
which use hairy baleen plates
instead of teeth to trap their prey.

00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:16.322
Meanwhile, toothed whales do use
echolocation,

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.182
and they and other species
of baleen whales

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:23.871
make social sounds, such as 
cries and whistles, to communicate.

00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:28.292
But those vocalizations 
lack the complexity of songs.

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:29.992
So how do they do it?

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:34.988
Land mammals like us generate sound
by moving air over our vocal cords

00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:38.114
when we exhale,
causing them to vibrate.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.262
Baleen whales have a U-shaped fold
of tissue between their lungs

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:47.492
and their large inflatable organs
called laryngeal sacs.

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.705
We don't know this for sure

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.115
because it's essentially impossible
to observe the internal organs

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:55.104
of a living, singing whale,

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:57.333
but we think that when a whale sings,

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.113
muscular contractions in the throat
and chest

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:06.023
move air from the lungs across
the U-fold and into the laryngeal sacs,

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:08.483
causing the U-fold to vibrate.

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:14.163
The resulting sound resonates in the sacs
like a choir singing in a cathedral

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:19.194
making songs loud enough to propagate
up to thousands of kilometers away.

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:21.765
Whales don't have to exhale to sing.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:25.334
Instead, the air is recycled 
back into the lungs,

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:27.984
creating sound once more.

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:31.763
One reason whale songs are so fascinating
is their pattern.

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:36.615
Units, like moans, cries, and chirps
are arranged in phrases.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.674
Repeated phrases 
are assembled into themes.

00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:44.553
Multiple themes repeated in a predictable
pattern create a song.

00:02:44.553 --> 00:02:47.115
This hierarchical structure 
is a kind of grammar.

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.842
Whale songs are extremely variable
in duration,

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:54.135
and whales can repeat them over and over.

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:59.954
In one recorded session,
a humpback whale sang for 22 hours.

00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.564
And why do they do it?

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:05.155
We don't yet know the exact purpose,
but we can speculate.

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:09.315
Given that the singers are males and 
they mostly sing during the mating season,

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.266
songs might be used to attract females.

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:17.036
Or perhaps they're territorial,
used to deter other males.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:21.155
Whales return to the same feeding
and breeding grounds annually,

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:24.966
and each discrete population has
a different song.

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:31.196
Songs evolve over time as units
or phrases are added, changed, or dropped.

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:35.020
And when males from different populations
are feeding within earshot,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.300
phrases are often exchanged,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.855
maybe because new songs make them more
attractive to breeding females.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.586
This is one of the fastest examples
of cultural transmission,

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:49.470
where learned behaviors are passed
between unrelated individuals

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.520
of the same species.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.507
We can eavesdrop on these songs
using underwater microphones

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:56.406
called hydrophones.

00:03:56.406 --> 00:04:02.007
These help us track species when sightings
or genetic samples are rare.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.897
For example, scientists have been able
to differentiate

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:10.335
the elusive blue whale's populations
worldwide based on their songs.

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:14.946
But the oceans are getting noisier
as a result of human activity.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:15.676
Boating,

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:16.756
military sonar,

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.127
underwater construction,

00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:22.156
and seismic surveys for oil
are occurring more often

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:25.347
which may interfere 
with whale's communication.

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:28.667
Some whales will avoid key feeding
or breeding grounds

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.298
if human noise is too loud.

00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:34.557
And humpback whales have been observed
to reduce their singing

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.898
in response to noise 200 kilometers away.

00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:41.557
Limiting human activity
along migratory routes

00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:43.617
and in other critical habitats,

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.437
and reducing noise pollution
throughout the ocean

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:49.987
would help ensure 
whales continued survival.

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:52.838
If the whales can keep singing
and we can keep listening,

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:56.537
maybe one day we'll truly understand
what they're saying.
