00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:05.165
I come to you today to speak of liars,

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.612
lawsuits

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:07.976
and laughter.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.020
The first time I heard
about Holocaust denial,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.346
I laughed.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.722
Holocaust denial?

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:19.617
The Holocaust which has
the dubious distinction

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:24.136
of being the best-documented
genocide in the world?

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:27.072
Who could believe it didn't happen?

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:29.453
Think about it.

00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:32.538
For deniers to be right,

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.458
who would have to be wrong?

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.777
Well, first of all, the victims --

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.518
the survivors who have told us
their harrowing stories.

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.035
Who else would have to be wrong?

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.012
The bystanders.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.014
The people who lived in the myriads
of towns and villages and cities

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:54.010
on the Eastern front,

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:56.476
who watched their neighbors
be rounded up --

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.713
men, women, children, young, old --

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:02.457
and be marched
to the outskirts of the town

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.473
to be shot and left dead in ditches.

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:07.315
Or the Poles,

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:12.020
who lived in towns and villages
around the death camps,

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:14.420
who watched day after day

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:17.186
as the trains went in filled with people

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.733
and came out empty.

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:23.420
But above all, who would have to be wrong?

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.469
The perpetrators.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:29.018
The people who say, "We did it.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.003
I did it."

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:33.176
Now, maybe they add a caveat.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.624
They say, "I didn't have a choice;
I was forced to do it."

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:40.773
But nonetheless, they say, "I did it."

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:43.489
Think about it.

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:49.452
In not one war crimes trial
since the end of World War II

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:56.112
has a perpetrator of any nationality
ever said, "It didn't happen."

00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:01.660
Again, they may have said, "I was forced,"
but never that it didn't happen.

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:03.158
Having thought that through,

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:07.133
I decided denial was not
going to be on my agenda;

00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:10.865
I had bigger things to worry about,
to write about, to research,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.203
and I moved on.

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:15.730
Fast-forward a little over a decade,

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.566
and two senior scholars --

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.748
two of the most prominent historians
of the Holocaust --

00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:22.029
approached me and said,

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:23.842
"Deborah, let's have coffee.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.463
We have a research idea
that we think is perfect for you."

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:31.320
Intrigued and flattered
that they came to me with an idea

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:32.921
and thought me worthy of it,

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.041
I asked, "What is it?"

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:38.654
And they said, "Holocaust denial."

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:41.848
And for the second time, I laughed.

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.260
Holocaust denial?

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:46.270
The Flat Earth folks?

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.431
The Elvis-is-alive people?

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:50.643
I should study them?

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.643
And these two guys said,

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.600
"Yeah, we're intrigued.

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.584
What are they about?

00:02:56.608 --> 00:02:58.358
What's their objective?

00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:02.036
How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?"

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:06.284
So thinking, if they thought
it was worthwhile,

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:09.682
I would take a momentary diversion --

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.644
maybe a year, maybe two,
three, maybe even four --

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:14.913
in academic terms, that's momentary.

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:16.079
(Laughter)

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.490
We work very slowly.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:20.086
(Laughter)

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.912
And I would look at them.

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:23.091
So I did.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.954
I did my research, and I came up
with a number of things,

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:28.571
two of which I'd like to share
with you today.

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:29.928
One:

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:34.909
deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.

00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:38.677
They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis --

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:41.928
you can decide whether you want
to put a "neo" there or not.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.119
But when I looked at them,

00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:49.869
I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:53.044
swastika-like symbols on the wall,

00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:55.125
Sieg Heil salutes --

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.693
none of that.

00:03:56.717 --> 00:03:59.587
What I found instead

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:04.226
were people parading
as respectable academics.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:06.137
What did they have?

00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.859
They had an institute.

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:11.727
An "Institute for Historical Review."

00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:14.946
They had a journal -- a slick journal --

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.924
a "Journal of Historical Review."

00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:21.104
One filled with papers --

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:23.172
footnote-laden papers.

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:25.863
And they had a new name.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.668
Not neo-Nazis,

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:31.182
not anti-Semites --

00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:32.464
revisionists.

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:35.206
They said, "We are revisionists.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.913
We are out to do one thing:

00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:41.497
to revise mistakes in history."

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:47.779
But all you had to do was go
one inch below the surface,

00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:49.710
and what did you find there?

00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:52.224
The same adulation of Hitler,

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:54.123
praise of the Third Reich,

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:57.089
anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.

00:04:57.904 --> 00:05:00.350
This is what intrigued me.

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:07.371
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,
parading as rational discourse.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.317
The other thing I found --

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:14.086
many of us have been taught to think
there are facts and there are opinions --

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.566
after studying deniers,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.926
I think differently.

00:05:17.438 --> 00:05:19.086
There are facts,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.824
there are opinions,

00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:22.460
and there are lies.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.575
And what deniers want to do
is take their lies,

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:30.197
dress them up as opinions --

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.211
maybe edgy opinions,

00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:34.944
maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.352
but then if they're opinions,

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:38.508
they should be part of the conversation.

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:41.925
And then they encroach on the facts.

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:44.868
I published my work --

00:05:44.892 --> 00:05:46.066
the book was published,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.492
"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing
Assault on Truth and Memory,"

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.472
it came out in many different countries,

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:53.656
including here in Penguin UK,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.110
and I was done with those folks
and ready to move on.

00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:01.871
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:05.202
And for the third time, I laughed ...

00:06:07.088 --> 00:06:08.328
mistakenly.

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:10.702
I opened the letter,

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:16.614
and it informed me that David Irving
was bringing a libel suit against me

00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:18.235
in the United Kingdom

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.295
for calling him a Holocaust denier.

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:23.887
David Irving suing me?

00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:25.115
Who was David Irving?

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.746
David Irving was a writer
of historical works,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.793
most of them about World War II,

00:06:29.817 --> 00:06:33.036
and virtually all of those works
took the position

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.638
that the Nazis were really not so bad,

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:39.746
and the Allies were really not so good.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.875
And the Jews, whatever happened to them,

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.209
they sort of deserved it.

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:45.697
He knew the documents,

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:47.164
he knew the facts,

00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:50.360
but he somehow twisted them
to get this opinion.

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:53.528
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:55.293
but in the late '80s,

00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:57.744
he embraced it with great vigor.

00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:03.422
The reason I laughed also
was this was a man

00:07:03.446 --> 00:07:05.380
who not only was a Holocaust denier,

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:07.099
but seemed quite proud of it.

00:07:07.123 --> 00:07:08.747
Here was a man -- and I quote --

00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.465
who said, "I'm going to sink
the battleship Auschwitz."

00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:14.517
Here was a man

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.561
who pointed to the number tattooed
on a survivor's arm and said,

00:07:19.716 --> 00:07:21.308
"How much money have you made

00:07:21.332 --> 00:07:24.732
from having that number
tattooed on your arm?"

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:27.457
Here was a man who said,

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.437
"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car

00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:31.773
at Chappaquiddick

00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:35.111
than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:37.972
That's an American reference,
but you can look it up.

00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:42.420
This was not a man who seemed
at all ashamed or reticent

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:44.513
about being a Holocaust denier.

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:48.916
Now, lots of my academic
colleagues counseled me --

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.846
"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it."

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.458
When I explained you can't just
ignore a libel suit,

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:57.264
they said, "Who's going to
believe him anyway?"

00:07:57.783 --> 00:07:59.863
But here was the problem:

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:05.195
British law put the onus,
put the burden of proof on me

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:07.901
to prove the truth of what I said,

00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:10.688
in contrast to as it would have
been in the United States

00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:12.216
and in many other countries:

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.246
on him to prove the falsehood.

00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:17.382
What did that mean?

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:20.782
That meant if I didn't fight,

00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:23.232
he would win by default.

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.546
And if he won by default,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.211
he could then legitimately say,

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:33.571
"My David Irving version of the Holocaust
is a legitimate version.

00:08:33.595 --> 00:08:35.779
Deborah Lipstadt was found
to have libeled me

00:08:35.803 --> 00:08:37.750
when she called me a Holocaust denier.

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:42.202
Ipso facto, I, David Irving,
am not a Holocaust denier."

00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:43.938
And what is that version?

00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:47.427
There was no plan to murder the Jews,

00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:49.503
there were no gas chambers,

00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:51.383
there were no mass shootings,

00:08:51.407 --> 00:08:54.578
Hitler had nothing to do
with any suffering that went on,

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:58.407
and the Jews have made this all up

00:08:58.431 --> 00:09:00.829
to get money from Germany

00:09:00.853 --> 00:09:02.560
and to get a state,

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:05.961
and they've done it with the aid
and abettance of the Allies --

00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:09.450
they've planted the documents
and planted the evidence.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.840
I couldn't let that stand

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.064
and ever face a survivor

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:17.798
or a child of survivors.

00:09:17.822 --> 00:09:19.974
I couldn't let that stand

00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:24.249
and consider myself
a responsible historian.

00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:26.932
So we fought.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:29.238
And for those of you
who haven't seen "Denial,"

00:09:29.262 --> 00:09:30.421
spoiler alert:

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.663
we won.

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:32.982
(Laughter)

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.573
(Applause)

00:09:39.988 --> 00:09:44.229
The judge found David Irving

00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:47.584
to be a liar,

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:48.771
a racist,

00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:50.049
an anti-Semite.

00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:52.433
His view of history was tendentious,

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:54.383
he lied, he distorted --

00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:57.050
and most importantly,

00:09:57.074 --> 00:09:59.187
he did it deliberately.

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.350
We showed a pattern,
in over 25 different major instances.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:06.484
Not small things -- many of us
in this audience write books,

00:10:06.508 --> 00:10:07.693
are writing books;

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:11.183
we always make mistakes, that's why
we're glad to have second editions:

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:12.393
correct the mistakes.

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:13.567
(Laughter)

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:17.770
But these always moved
in the same direction:

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.829
blame the Jews,

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:23.028
exonerate the Nazis.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.284
But how did we win?

00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:31.576
What we did is follow his footnotes
back to his sources.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.973
And what did we find?

00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:35.476
Not in most cases,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.468
and not in the preponderance of cases,

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:41.803
but in every single instance where
he made some reference to the Holocaust,

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:46.069
that his supposed evidence was distorted,

00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:47.513
half-truth,

00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:48.871
date-changed,

00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:51.082
sequence-changed,

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:53.230
someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.

00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:56.015
In other words,
he didn't have the evidence.

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:58.148
His evidence didn't prove it.

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.831
We didn't prove what happened.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:04.127
We proved that what he said happened --

00:11:04.151 --> 00:11:07.011
and by extension, all deniers,
because he either quotes them

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:09.506
or they get their arguments from him --

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.776
is not true.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.989
What they claim --

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:14.635
they don't have the evidence to prove it.

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:21.353
So why is my story
more than just the story

00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:25.184
of a quirky, long,
six-year, difficult lawsuit,

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:30.197
an American professor
being dragged into a courtroom

00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:33.265
by a man that the court
declared in its judgment

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:35.539
was a neo-Nazi polemicist?

00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:37.346
What message does it have?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.773
I think in the context
of the question of truth,

00:11:40.797 --> 00:11:43.259
it has a very significant message.

00:11:43.283 --> 00:11:45.068
Because today,

00:11:45.092 --> 00:11:46.758
as we well know,

00:11:46.782 --> 00:11:50.898
truth and facts are under assault.

00:11:51.702 --> 00:11:54.954
Social media, for all
the gifts it has given us,

00:11:54.978 --> 00:12:00.559
has also allowed the difference
between facts -- established facts --

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:02.340
and lies

00:12:02.364 --> 00:12:03.762
to be flattened.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.500
Third of all:

00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:07.995
extremism.

00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:12.564
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,

00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:14.659
you may not see burning crosses,

00:12:14.683 --> 00:12:19.002
you may not even hear outright
white supremacist language.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:23.932
It may go by names: "alt-right,"
"National Front" -- pick your names.

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:29.791
But underneath, it's that same extremism
that I found in Holocaust denial

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:33.209
parading as rational discourse.

00:12:35.134 --> 00:12:40.351
We live in an age
where truth is on the defensive.

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:42.859
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.

00:12:42.883 --> 00:12:45.403
A quiz show recently appeared
in "The New Yorker"

00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:48.649
where the host of the quiz show
is saying to one of the contestants,

00:12:48.673 --> 00:12:50.982
"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.

00:12:51.006 --> 00:12:53.499
But your opponent yelled
more loudly than you did,

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.048
so he gets the point."

00:12:56.228 --> 00:12:57.735
What can we do?

00:12:58.557 --> 00:12:59.934
First of all,

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:05.389
we cannot be beguiled
by rational appearances.

00:13:05.413 --> 00:13:07.182
We've got to look underneath,

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:10.007
and we will find there the extremism.

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.977
Second of all,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:19.082
we must understand
that truth is not relative.

00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:22.601
Number three,

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:26.314
we must go on the offensive,

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.111
not the defensive.

00:13:28.676 --> 00:13:31.283
When someone makes an outrageous claim,

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:34.811
even though they may hold
one of the highest offices in the land,

00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:36.846
if not the world --

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.380
we must say to them,

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:40.370
"Where's the proof?

00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:42.531
Where's the evidence?"

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.482
We must hold their feet to the fire.

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:50.112
We must not treat it as if their lies
are the same as the facts.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:54.935
And as I said earlier,
truth is not relative.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.815
Many of us have grown up
in the world of the academy

00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.580
and enlightened liberal thought,

00:13:59.604 --> 00:14:02.565
where we're taught
everything is open to debate.

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.178
But that's not the case.

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:08.644
There are certain things that are true.

00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:12.212
There are indisputable facts --

00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:13.926
objective truths.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:19.336
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.027
Even after being forced
to recant by the Vatican

00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:26.624
that the Earth moved around the Sun,

00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:27.802
he came out,

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.136
and what is he reported to have said?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.982
"And yet, it still moves."

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.182
The Earth is not flat.

00:14:38.206 --> 00:14:40.496
The climate is changing.

00:14:41.387 --> 00:14:43.655
Elvis is not alive.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.214
(Laughter)

00:14:45.238 --> 00:14:47.554
(Applause)

00:14:47.578 --> 00:14:49.879
And most importantly,

00:14:49.903 --> 00:14:54.552
truth and fact are under assault.

00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:56.899
The job ahead of us,

00:14:56.923 --> 00:14:58.126
the task ahead of us,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.744
the challenge ahead of us

00:14:59.768 --> 00:15:01.002
is great.

00:15:01.747 --> 00:15:04.384
The time to fight is short.

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.084
We must act now.

00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:12.174
Later will be too late.

00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:13.460
Thank you very much.

00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:17.530
(Applause)
