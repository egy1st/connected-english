00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.896
Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.616
or should we say, have a seat, mom.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.405
(Cheers)

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.336
So no doubt, you guys are like me.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.976
You saw the release of Serena

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.056
in that great yellow
bathing suit last week

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.496
and when I saw it,
all I could think of was,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.296
"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.256
I was very selfish, I know.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.936
So I asked you about that picture,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.736
and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.016
What do you mean?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.096
Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.896
I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.896
and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.256
and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going --

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.176
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.896
SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.936
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.536
to be quite honest,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.776
and I'd been saving it,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.056
and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and --

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.096
(Laughter)

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.736
GK: And there it was.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.656
SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much --

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.896
and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.256
and I'm like, that's weird,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.216
and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.456
But it was a good moment.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.176
I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.616
GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.496
so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.256
SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.616
I've been just tracking it.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.056
18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.816
and I've been so good about it,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.096
and this was the one time that I slipped.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.696
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.976
SW: Yes, thank you.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.136
GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.616
were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.176
That you were pregnant, I mean.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.176
SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.136
which is one of the biggest grand slams.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.816
GK: You found out two days before?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.496
SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.016
I was nervous.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.696
I wasn't quite sure what to think,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.456
but I just knew that at that moment

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.536
it was really important for me
to just focus right there

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.816
at the Australian Open,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.096
and I was definitely not sure what to do.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.496
I was like, can I play?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.976
I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.856
so I had a lot of questions.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.416
GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.016
(Cheers)

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.240
SW: Yeah.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.536
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.776
SW: Thank you.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.016
(Applause)

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.416
GK: While pregnant!

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.776
SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.936
GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.016
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.976
You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.616
they get sick and they get tired.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.296
GK: Have you had morning sickness?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.096
SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.216
But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.176
and I had to really take all that energy,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.216
put it in a paper bag, so to say,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.456
and throw it away,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.616
because I really felt
like I didn't have time

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.736
to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.176
because pregnant or not, no one knew,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.176
and I was supposed to win that tournament

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.136
as I am every tournament that I show up.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.376
I am expected to win,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.816
and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.176
GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.256
SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.176
and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.416
and kind of just bottle them up

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.576
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.176
GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.136
Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.616
I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.136
They said, "Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant."

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.336
But then you always have
these cranky Yankees.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.416
On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.616
who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.896
You have responded to him.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.976
I'm not even going
to dignify what he said,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.896
but you responded. Why did you respond?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.576
SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.336
and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.176
and the people that I've worked with.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.936
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.496
and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.536
and it's something that these young women,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.896
they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.255
and for me, it's just like,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.416
I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.656
So not only --

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.896
(Applause)

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.096
Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.816
I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.216
and to stand up for myself.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.936
And at that point it was
really important for me to say,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.816
like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.416
but this is inappropriate,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.896
and there's time and there's
a place for everything.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.096
And that really
wasn't the time and the place.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.016
GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.536
because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.776
And your coach said
age is always important,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.696
but in tennis it's very important,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.816
but he has no doubt
that you're coming back.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.536
Have you thought, am I coming back?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.416
Will I take some time off?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.376
I know the women on the tour are saying,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.576
"How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.816
What are you thinking?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.456
SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.816
so for me everything is really mental.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.256
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.136
I'm really inspired by my sister.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.816
She's a year older than me,
and that's something that --

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.856
if she's still playing, I know I can play.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.456
(Laughter)

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.816
And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.936
and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.736
So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.936
and I know that
it's something I want to do.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.136
And my story is definitely not over yet.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.056
I was talking to my coach about it,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.376
and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.416
and my baby's going to be in the stands

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.336
and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.136
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.936
that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.096
to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.536
A lot of people feel that.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.776
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.456
You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time:

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.696
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.576
And when I saw you last year,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880
I was saying, "How's
your love life? Da da da."

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.576
You said, "I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.136
You won't know who he is."

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.416
I said, "What's his name?"

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.616
SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.656
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian."
I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.776
But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.056
and you said, you neither.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.576
SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.336
but it's been the best thing for me.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.296
GK: The best thing why?

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.936
Does that look like a nerdy geek?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.176
Look at the shirt.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.216
(Laughter)

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.496
No, he's a very nice guy.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.376
SW: You can tell he's into technology.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.136
GK: He's a very, very nice guy.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.736
I like him very much.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.016
So how did he succeed
when others have failed?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.936
How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.216
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.496
but ...

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.736
(Laughter)

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.046
GK: Say it, Serena, say it!

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.896
SW: Well ...

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.320
(Laughter)

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.976
Yes.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.056
(Applause)

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.496
GK: But you know what I mean.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.296
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.896
and when she said that to me,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.616
I was like, you know, he really is,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.976
and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.256
GK: Like?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.496
SW: Something simple.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.376
My fashion company,
we have a show every year,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.376
so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.216
because I do everything for the show,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.896
and everything for it,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.616
so I was running around like crazy,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.016
and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.616
and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.976
and it was -- it's a weird story.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.976
It was better in person, I promise.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.976
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.136
Or was it a Beyoncé song?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.736
"If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it"?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.713
Were you feeling pressure to get married?

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.056
Did you know it was coming?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.736
SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.016
and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.176
I really love my life.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.736
I love my freedom.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.296
I heard that kind of changes.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.376
But I love everything that I do,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.696
and I love my career,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.976
and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.816
I've actually been so career-oriented

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.336
and in fact, when he proposed,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.696
I was almost angry.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.016
Not almost. I was angry,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.896
because it was right
in the middle of my training season,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.056
and I said, "I gotta win
the Australian Open.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.656
I can't fly to Rome."

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.496
Because he wanted to take me to Rome,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.216
and I said, "I can't. I gotta win."

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.656
But that's how focused I was.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.576
GK: This is a girl that says,
"No, I can't go to Rome." OK.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.336
SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.856
and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.736
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.416
and that really meant a lot to me,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.216
and when I put my mind to something,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.096
I really am determined to reach it

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.776
no matter what.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.656
GK: You know, you said that for you --

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.136
I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.376
SW: It is.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.616
GK: What do you mean?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.376
SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.096
I feel like once you experience it,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.376
you always want to get that feeling again,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.896
and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.616
but I never forgot that feeling,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.216
and I feel like every time I win one,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.896
I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.376
There's really no feeling
in the world like that.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.376
And it's like, all these years of training

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.456
and being a little kid and playing,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.936
and then winning
is a wonderful experience.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.416
So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.816
and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like --

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.936
GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.256
SW: I'm not the best loser.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.416
GK: That you're very, very, very bad.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.696
Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.936
I get that.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.816
But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.096
(Laughter)

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.856
SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.016
(Laughter)

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.656
(Applause)

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.776
GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.616
because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.296
knows that you two are very close,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.776
and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.896
but I often wonder,
when you're playing her,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.656
do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.696
or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.136
Is it harder for you
playing her or easier?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.376
SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.736
because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.376
And it was something
that has been difficult,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.096
because she's my toughest opponent.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.856
She's tall, she's fast,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.976
she hits hard like me, she serves like me.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.576
It's really like playing a wall.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.816
GK: She knows you.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.536
SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.976
so it's something that is not very easy,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.736
but it's really about,
when I go out there,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.736
I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.976
"You know what?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.776
I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.216
I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.256
today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.456
and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.736
anywhere on this world."

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.616
GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.736
Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.976
SW: Yes.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.536
GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.256
Do you feel guilt about that?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.936
Do you feel joy in that?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.776
Is that a difficult position for you?

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.496
SW: I don't feel anything in there.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.976
In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.096
She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.336
she's my soul mate.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.560
I mean --

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.216
There's pictures of her pushing me,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.136
really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.536
of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.096
and she always took care of me.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.644
I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff,

00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:47.976
and she would take her money
and give it to me at school

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.936
and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.256
and that's the kind of person
she actually is

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.736
since I've always known her.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.056
So we always have this incredible
respect for each other

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.336
and this incredible love,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.656
and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.936
but you can still have
a wonderful relationship.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.656
On the court we are mortal enemies,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.496
but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.136
And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.376
but for Venus --

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.416
(Laughter)

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.296
GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.736
and say, "That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah"?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.496
You never have any moment like that?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.696
SW: I feel like she should have
those moments,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.816
because she's never done
anything bad to me,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.976
but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.696
GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.056
I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.440
SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.536
GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.816
SW: Yes. GK: I know that.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.056
SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.616
and we are incredibly close.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.856
Not only her.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.976
I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.856
GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.016
and say, look, we're going
to go out there and -- there's nothing?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.376
SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.136
we were in the locker room together,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.696
and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.016
I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.296
but she was so mad at me.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.096
She's like, "Serena, stop!"
And I was just laughing at her.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.176
But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.776
the second we step on the court,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.976
it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.216
but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just --

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.496
It is what it is,
because at the end of the day,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.856
she'll always be my sister.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.696
I'm not going to play Australia in --

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.776
Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.336
but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.856
Let's be safe and say 50 years.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.816
GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.856
When you think about it,
never been anybody

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.696
who has intersected
gender and race the way you have,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.536
the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.816
And when you were growing up,
did you say, "I want to be like that"?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.840
Because now little girls
are looking at you

00:14:01.864 --> 00:14:03.456
saying, "I want to be like that."

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.616
Who was the "I want
to be like that" for you?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.536
SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.176
For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.536
and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.376
So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.776
I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.776
and I would even see Pete Sampras,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.256
and I would see what they did,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.376
and I noticed that Steffi and Monica

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.816
didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.576
and they kind of were on their own,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.016
and they were just so focused

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.136
and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.736
and I was like, "I want to do that."

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.976
So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.576
and if you want to be the best,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.136
you have to hang around people

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.496
and you have to look at people
that are the best,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.416
because you're not going to be the best

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.136
if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.216
GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.696
SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.216
SW: People say, "Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic."

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.616
Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.096
I grew up when I got older,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.576
and I had to work really hard,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.856
and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.056
is because I was
really, really, really small.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.776
GK: Yeah.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.096
You are no longer small.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.256
SW: No, I'm fully grown now.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.136
But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.456
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.376
GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.936
Your body brings men
and women to their knees.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.936
And I mean in a good way.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.696
A lot has been made about your body.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.136
It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.176
there's never been anything like it.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.896
Did you have body issues
when you were growing up?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.176
Have you always been
comfortable with your body?

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.936
SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.776
growing up in the public eye,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.936
it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.776
and as any female that's a teenager,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.016
I definitely was not
comfortable in my body.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.376
I didn't like it.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.216
I didn't understand why I had muscles.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.696
And I stopped lifting weights.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.536
I was like, I'm not going to do this.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.176
But then after I won the US Open,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.456
I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.176
and I wanted to be happy with it,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.576
and I was so appreciative of it.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.816
I'm always healthy.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.656
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.616
and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.776
but I want other people
and other young girls

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.496
that have experienced
what I've experienced

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.896
to be happy with themselves.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.176
So whatever people say --

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.616
masculine, whatever,
too much, too little --

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.016
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.720
(Applause)

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.616
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.336
but what have you learned from losing?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.856
SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.976
The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.376
and some of them are extremely painful,

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.416
but I wouldn't take any of them away,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.656
because every time I lose,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.936
it takes a really long time
for me to lose again

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.816
because I learn so much from it.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.256
And I encourage everyone that I talk to --

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.936
I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens --

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.816
not in sports --
in business or in school --

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.455
learn from it.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.576
Don't live in the past,
live in the present,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.816
and don't make the same
mistakes in the future.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.016
That's something
that I always try to live by.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.656
GK: Now you're planning a wedding

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.896
and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.296
in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida?

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.016
What are you thinking?

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.056
Big or small?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.935
SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.216
but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.896
So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking --

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.976
My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.416
I'm not too serious.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.216
GK: And you like to dance.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.336
And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.336
SW: Oh, next for me.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.296
Obviously I'm going to have a baby

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.296
and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.056
and keep working on my fashion line.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.336
That'll be really fun.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.216
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.936
SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.976
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.336
GK: Gayle is a unisex name.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.976
Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.056
SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.056
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.336
Thank you guys.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.640
(Applause)
