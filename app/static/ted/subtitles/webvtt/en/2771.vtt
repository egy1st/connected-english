00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:05.531
How many people here would like to live
to be at least 80 years old?

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.547
Yeah.

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.366
I think we all have
this hopeful expectation

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.350
of living into old age.

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:14.914
Let's project out into the future,

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:16.498
to your future "you's,"

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.375
and let's imagine that we're all 85.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.912
Now, everyone look at two people.

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:26.683
One of you probably has
Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:30.789
(Laughter)

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:32.407
Alright, alright.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:36.771
And maybe you're thinking,
"Well, it won't be me."

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.735
Then, OK. You are a caregiver.

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:42.552
So --

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.448
(Laughter)

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:46.829
so in some way,

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:50.497
this terrifying disease
is likely to affect us all.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.947
Part of the fear around Alzheimer's
stems from the sense

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.385
that there's nothing we can do about it.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.534
Despite decades of research, we still
have no disease-modifying treatment

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:02.865
and no cure.

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.790
So if we're lucky enough
to live long enough,

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:08.922
Alzheimer's appears to be
our brain's destiny.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.249
But maybe it doesn't have to be.

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.950
What if I told you we could
change these statistics,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.664
literally change our brain's destiny,

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:21.217
without relying on a cure
or advancements in medicine?

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:24.508
Let's begin by looking at
what we currently understand

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:26.889
about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.739
Here's a picture
of two neurons connecting.

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:34.120
The point of connection,
this space circled in red,

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:35.783
is called the synapse.

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:38.999
The synapse is where
neurotransmitters are released.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:43.291
This is where signals are transmitted,
where communication happens.

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:48.421
This is where we think,
feel, see, hear, desire ...

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:50.094
and remember.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.016
And the synapse
is where Alzheimer's happens.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.002
Let's zoom in on the synapse

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:58.113
and look at a cartoon representation
of what's going on.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.086
During the business
of communicating information,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.108
in addition to releasing neurotransmitters
like glutamate into the synapse,

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:09.593
neurons also release a small peptide
called amyloid beta.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:15.601
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away
metabolized by microglia,

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.778
the janitor cells of our brains.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:22.264
While the molecular causes
of Alzheimer's are still debated,

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:25.542
most neuroscientists believe
that the disease begins

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:28.396
when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:31.716
Too much is released,
or not enough is cleared away,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.074
and the synapse begins
to pile up with amyloid beta.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:37.317
And when this happens, it binds to itself,

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.630
forming sticky aggregates
called amyloid plaques.

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:44.535
How many people here
are 40 years old or older?

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:47.704
You're afraid to admit it now.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:49.954
This initial step into the disease,

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.062
this presence of amyloid
plaques accumulating,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.680
can already be found in your brains.

00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.741
The only way we could be sure of this
would be through a PET scan,

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:03.581
because at this point,
you are blissfully unaware.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:07.894
You're not showing any impairments
in memory, language, or cognition ...

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:09.069
yet.

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:14.008
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years
of amyloid plaque accumulation

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:16.413
before it reaches a tipping point,

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:18.672
then triggering a molecular cascade

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:21.363
that causes the clinical
symptoms of the disease.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.771
Prior to the tipping point,

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:27.379
your lapses in memory
might include things like,

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.728
"Why did I come in this room?"

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.980
or "Oh ... what's his name?"

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.823
or "Where did I put my keys?"

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:38.109
Now, before you all
start freaking out again,

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:43.531
because I know half of you did at least
one of those in the last 24 hours --

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.792
these are all normal kinds of forgetting.

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.129
In fact, I would argue that these examples

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:51.130
might not even involve your memory,

00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:54.046
because you didn't pay attention
to where you put your keys

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.415
in the first place.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.117
After the tipping point,

00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.664
the glitches in memory,
language and cognition are different.

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:03.588
Instead of eventually finding
your keys in your coat pocket

00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:05.614
or on the table by the door,

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.352
you find them in the refrigerator,

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:10.342
or you find them and you think,

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:11.899
"What are these for?"

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:18.051
So what happens when amyloid plaques
accumulate to this tipping point?

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.394
Our microglia janitor cells
become hyper-activated,

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:25.552
releasing chemicals that cause
inflammation and cellular damage.

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:28.171
We think they might actually
start clearing away

00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:29.899
the synapses themselves.

00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:34.846
A crucial neural transport protein
called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.454
and twists itself
into something called "tangles,"

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:40.513
which choke off the neurons
from the inside.

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:44.371
By mid-stage Alzheimer's,
we have massive inflammation and tangles

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:46.342
and all-out war at the synapse

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:47.619
and cell death.

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:51.326
So if you were a scientist
trying to cure this disease,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.347
at what point would you ideally
want to intervene?

00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:59.038
Many scientists are betting big
on the simplest solution:

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:02.896
keep amyloid plaques
from reaching that tipping point,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.948
which means that drug discovery is largely
focused on developing a compound

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:12.320
that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce
amyloid plaque accumulation.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.048
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be
a preventative medicine.

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:21.501
We're going to have to take this pill
before we reach that tipping point,

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:23.777
before the cascade is triggered,

00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:26.829
before we start leaving
our keys in the refrigerator.

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:31.054
We think this is why, to date,
these kinds of drugs have failed

00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:32.315
in clinical trials --

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.784
not because the science wasn't sound,

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:38.942
but because the people in these trials
were already symptomatic.

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.698
It was too late.

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:43.974
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.

00:05:43.998 --> 00:05:47.416
At the tipping point, the match
sets fire to the forest.

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:49.834
Once the forest is ablaze,

00:05:49.858 --> 00:05:52.340
it doesn't do any good
to blow out the match.

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:55.887
You have to blow out the match
before the forest catches fire.

00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:58.194
Even before scientists sort this out,

00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:01.086
this information is actually
really good news for us,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.154
because it turns out that the way we live
can influence the accumulation

00:06:05.178 --> 00:06:06.407
of amyloid plaques.

00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:08.007
And so there are things we can do

00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.650
to keep us from reaching
that tipping point.

00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:15.005
Let's picture your risk
of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.078
We're going to pile
risk factors on one arm,

00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:19.580
and when that arm hits the floor,
you are symptomatic

00:06:19.604 --> 00:06:21.539
and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:06:22.058 --> 00:06:24.777
Let's imagine you're 50 years old.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.536
You're not a spring chicken anymore,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.632
so you've accumulated
some amyloid plaques with age.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.847
Your scale is tipped a little bit.

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:34.062
Now let's look at your DNA.

00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:38.088
We've all inherited our genes
from our moms and our dads.

00:06:38.112 --> 00:06:42.190
Some of these genes will increase our risk
and some will decrease it.

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:44.403
If you're like Alice in "Still Alice,"

00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:48.978
you've inherited a rare genetic mutation
that cranks out amyloid beta,

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:52.555
and this alone will tip
your scale arm to the ground.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.745
But for most of us, the genes we inherit
will only tip the arm a bit.

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.584
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
that increases amyloid,

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:04.876
but you can inherit a copy of APOE4
from mom and dad

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.291
and still never get Alzheimer's,

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:09.428
which means that for most of us,

00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:13.292
our DNA alone does not determine
whether we get Alzheimer's.

00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:15.458
So what does?

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:19.274
We can't do anything about getting older
or the genes we've inherited.

00:07:19.298 --> 00:07:22.295
So far, we haven't changed
our brain's destiny.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.609
What about sleep?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:29.360
In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells
rinse cerebral spinal fluid

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:30.600
throughout our brains,

00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:34.196
clearing away metabolic waste
that accumulated in our synapses

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.121
while we were awake.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.951
Deep sleep is like
a power cleanse for the brain.

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:42.832
But what happens if you shortchange
yourself on sleep?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.953
Many scientists believe

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:49.227
that poor sleep hygiene might actually
be a predictor of Alzheimer's.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:54.539
A single night of sleep deprivation
leads to an increase in amyloid beta.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.836
And amyloid accumulation
has been shown to disrupt sleep,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.347
which in turn causes
more amyloid to accumulate.

00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.847
And so now we have
this positive feedback loop

00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:06.744
that's going to accelerate
the tipping of that scale.

00:08:07.306 --> 00:08:08.729
What else?

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.379
Cardiovascular health.

00:08:11.043 --> 00:08:14.788
High blood pressure, diabetes,
obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,

00:08:14.812 --> 00:08:18.948
have all been shown to increase our risk
of developing Alzheimer's.

00:08:18.972 --> 00:08:20.863
Some autopsy studies have shown

00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:23.559
that as many as 80 percent
of people with Alzheimer's

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:26.345
also had cardiovascular disease.

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:31.374
Aerobic exercise has been shown
in many studies to decrease amyloid beta

00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:33.128
in animal models of the disease.

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:37.199
So a heart-healthy
Mediterranean lifestyle and diet

00:08:37.223 --> 00:08:39.877
can help to counter
the tipping of this scale.

00:08:40.697 --> 00:08:43.046
So there are many things we can do

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.442
to prevent or delay
the onset of Alzheimer's.

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:47.695
But let's say
you haven't done any of them.

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:50.665
Let's say you're 65;

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:54.355
there's Alzheimer's in your family,
so you've likely inherited a gene or two

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:56.403
that tips your scale arm a bit;

00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:59.159
you've been burning the candle
at both ends for years;

00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:00.686
you love bacon;

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.933
and you don't run unless
someone's chasing you.

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:04.258
(Laughter)

00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:07.894
Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques
have reached that tipping point.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:09.966
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.671
You've tripped the cascade,

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:13.261
setting fire to the forest,

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:16.383
causing inflammation, tangles,
and cell death.

00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:19.796
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.136
You should be having trouble
finding words and keys

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.306
and remembering what I said
at the beginning of this talk.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:28.631
But you might not be.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.658
There's one more thing you can do
to protect yourself

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:34.268
from experiencing
the symptoms of Alzheimer's,

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:38.783
even if you have the full-blown disease
pathology ablaze in your brain.

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:42.714
It has to do with neural plasticity
and cognitive reserve.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.638
Remember, the experience
of having Alzheimer's

00:09:45.662 --> 00:09:48.868
is ultimately a result of losing synapses.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.716
The average brain has
over a hundred trillion synapses,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.453
which is fantastic;
we've got a lot to work with.

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:57.146
And this isn't a static number.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.568
We gain and lose synapses all the time,

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:02.395
through a process
called neural plasticity.

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:04.491
Every time we learn something new,

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:08.642
we are creating and strengthening
new neural connections,

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:10.283
new synapses.

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:12.563
In the Nun Study,

00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:17.480
678 nuns, all over the age of 75
when the study began,

00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:19.813
were followed for more than two decades.

00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:23.297
They were regularly given
physical checkups and cognitive tests,

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:27.369
and when they died, their brains
were all donated for autopsy.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:31.768
In some of these brains, scientists
discovered something surprising.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:36.368
Despite the presence of plaques
and tangles and brain shrinkage --

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:39.261
what appeared to be
unquestionable Alzheimer's --

00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:42.964
the nuns who had belonged
to these brains showed no signs

00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:45.555
of having the disease
while they were alive.

00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:47.630
How can this be?

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:52.136
We think it's because these nuns
had a high level of cognitive reserve,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.083
which is a way of saying that they had
more functional synapses.

00:10:56.107 --> 00:10:58.681
People who have more years
of formal education,

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.940
who have a high degree of literacy,

00:11:00.964 --> 00:11:04.543
who engage regularly
in mentally stimulating activities,

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:07.048
all have more cognitive reserve.

00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:11.199
They have an abundance
and a redundancy in neural connections.

00:11:11.223 --> 00:11:13.903
So even if they have a disease
like Alzheimer's

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.981
compromising some of their synapses,

00:11:16.005 --> 00:11:18.990
they've got many extra backup connections,

00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:22.349
and this buffers them from noticing
that anything is amiss.

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:25.239
Let's imagine a simplified example.

00:11:25.263 --> 00:11:27.989
Let's say you only know one thing
about a subject.

00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:29.542
Let's say it's about me.

00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:31.872
You know that Lisa Genova
wrote "Still Alice,"

00:11:31.896 --> 00:11:34.332
and that's the only thing
you know about me.

00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:36.746
You have that single neural connection,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.716
that one synapse.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.901
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:43.258
You have plaques and tangles
and inflammation

00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:46.017
and microglia devouring that synapse.

00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:50.833
Now when someone asks you,
"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'"

00:11:50.857 --> 00:11:52.102
you can't remember,

00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:55.309
because that synapse
is either failing or gone.

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.092
You've forgotten me forever.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.386
But what if you had learned more about me?

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.499
Let's say you learned
four things about me.

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.368
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:07.387
and three of those synapses
are damaged or destroyed.

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:10.538
You still have a way
to detour the wreckage.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:12.581
You can still remember my name.

00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:17.209
So we can be resilient
to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:20.336
through the recruitment
of yet-undamaged pathways.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.139
And we create these pathways,
this cognitive reserve,

00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:25.863
by learning new things.

00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:30.976
Ideally, we want these new things
to be as rich in meaning as possible,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.739
recruiting sight and sound
and associations and emotion.

00:12:36.398 --> 00:12:39.533
So this really doesn't mean
doing crossword puzzles.

00:12:39.557 --> 00:12:43.654
You don't want to simply retrieve
information you've already learned,

00:12:43.678 --> 00:12:47.021
because this is like traveling
down old, familiar streets,

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:49.630
cruising neighborhoods you already know.

00:12:50.113 --> 00:12:52.947
You want to pave new neural roads.

00:12:52.971 --> 00:12:55.483
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain

00:12:55.507 --> 00:12:57.687
means learning to speak Italian,

00:12:57.711 --> 00:12:59.221
meeting new friends,

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.412
reading a book,

00:13:00.436 --> 00:13:02.805
or listening to a great TED Talk.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:08.596
And if, despite all of this, you are
someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.773
there are three lessons I've learned
from my grandmother

00:13:11.797 --> 00:13:15.534
and the dozens of people I've come to know
living with this disease.

00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:19.299
Diagnosis doesn't mean
you're dying tomorrow.

00:13:19.323 --> 00:13:21.045
Keep living.

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:23.435
You won't lose your emotional memory.

00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:26.965
You'll still be able
to understand love and joy.

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:29.992
You might not remember
what I said five minutes ago,

00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:32.301
but you'll remember how I made you feel.

00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:36.220
And you are more than what
you can remember.

00:13:36.244 --> 00:13:37.533
Thank you.

00:13:37.557 --> 00:13:42.880
(Applause)
