00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:03.563
Let's say you despise

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:05.033
Western democracy.

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.804
Democracy, in all its trappings,

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:11.491
free elections, town halls,

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.351
endless debates about
the proper role of government.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.708
Too messy,

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:16.888
too unpredictable,

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:18.876
too constraining for your taste.

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.961
And the way these democracies
band together and lecture everyone else

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.276
about individual rights and freedoms --

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.340
it gets under your skin.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.824
So what to do about it?

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.679
You can call out the hypocrisy
and failures of Western democracies

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.932
and explain how your way is better,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.011
but that's never really worked for you.

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.392
What if you could get the people

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:48.556
whose support is the very foundation
of these democracies

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.172
to start questioning the system?

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:54.890
Make the idea occur in their own minds

00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:59.026
that democracy and its institutions
are failing them,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.310
their elite are corrupt puppet masters

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:04.100
and the country they knew is in free fall.

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:07.057
To do that,

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.079
you'll need to infiltrate
the information spheres

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.405
of these democracies.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.130
You'll need to turn
their most powerful asset --

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:17.059
an open mind --

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:19.065
into their greatest vulnerability.

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:22.140
You'll need people to question the truth.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:28.844
Now, you'll be familiar of hacking
and leaks that happened in 2016.

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:31.690
One was the Democratic
National Committee's networks,

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:34.545
and the personal email
accounts of its staff,

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.422
later released on WikiLeaks.

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.350
After that, various online personas,

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:44.254
like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal
who didn't speak Romanian,

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:47.784
aggressively pushed news
of these leaks to journalists.

00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:50.787
The media took the bait.

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:53.918
They were consumed by how much
the DNC hated Bernie.

00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:59.158
At the time, it was that narrative
that far outshined the news

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:02.522
that a group of Russian government
sponsored hackers

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.779
who we called "Advanced
Persistent Threat 28,"

00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:08.384
or "APT28" for short,

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:11.465
was carrying out
these operations against the US.

00:02:12.192 --> 00:02:14.351
And there was no shortage of evidence.

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:18.702
This group of Russian government hackers
hadn't just appeared out of nowhere

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:19.890
in 2016.

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:23.071
We had started tracking
this group back in 2014.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:27.976
And the tools that APT28 used
to compromise its victims' networks

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.593
demonstrated a thoughtful,
well-resourced effort

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.443
that had taken place for now over a decade

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:35.966
in Moscow's time zone

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.976
from about 9 am to 6 pm.

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:44.177
APT28 loved to prey on the emails
and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,

00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:47.708
the Georgian government,
eastern European defense attachÃ©s --

00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:51.773
all targets with an undeniable interest
to the Russian government.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.757
We weren't the only ones onto this.

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:57.198
Governments, research teams
across the world,

00:02:57.222 --> 00:02:59.129
were coming to similar conclusions

00:02:59.153 --> 00:03:01.474
and observing the same
types of operations.

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:05.440
But what Russia was doing in 2016

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:07.378
went far beyond espionage.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.678
The DNC hack was just one of many
where stolen data was posted online

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.956
accompanied by a sensational narrative,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.918
then amplified in social media

00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:21.781
for lightning-speed adoption by the media.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.378
This didn't ring the alarm bells

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:31.893
that a nation-state was trying
to interfere with the credibility

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.841
of another's internal affairs.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:38.527
So why, collectively,
did we not see this coming?

00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.993
Why did it take months
before Americans understood

00:03:43.017 --> 00:03:47.138
that they were under a state-sponsored
information attack?

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.095
The easy answer is politics.

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.042
The Obama Administration was caught
in a perfect catch-22.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:58.464
By raising the specter that the Russian
government was interfering

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.580
in the US presidential campaign,

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:04.865
the Administration risked appearing
to meddle in the campaign itself.

00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:08.047
But the better answer, I think,

00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:11.924
is that the US and the West
were utterly unequipped

00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:16.602
to recognize and respond
to a modern information operation,

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:21.738
despite the fact that the US
had wielded information

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.947
with devastating success
in an era not so long ago.

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:30.178
Look, so while the US and the West
spent the last 20 years

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:31.756
caught up in cybersecurity --

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.275
what networks to harden,

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.608
which infrastructure to deem critical,

00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:39.625
how to set up armies of cyber warriors
and cyber commands --

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.382
Russia was thinking in far more
consequential terms.

00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:48.649
Before the first iPhone
even hit the shelf,

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:53.146
the Russian government understood
the risks and the opportunity

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.595
that technology provided

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.030
and the inter-communication
and instant communication it provided us.

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.708
As our realities are increasingly
based on the information

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:06.088
that we're consuming
at the palm of our hand

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:08.365
and from the news feeds
that we're scanning

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.355
and the hashtags and stories
that we see trending,

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.306
the Russian government
was the first to recognize

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.205
how this evolution

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.018
had turned your mind into the most
exploitable device on the planet.

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:25.418
And your mind is particularly exploitable

00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:29.217
if you're accustomed
to an unfettered flow of information,

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:32.520
now increasingly curated
to your own tastes.

00:05:35.244 --> 00:05:38.135
This panorama of information
that's so interesting to you

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:44.105
gives a state, or anyone for that matter,
a perfect back door into your mind.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.656
It's this new brand of state-sponsored
information operations

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.815
that can be that much more successful,

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.141
more insidious,

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:56.251
and harder for the target audience --
that includes the media --

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.059
to decipher and characterize.

00:05:58.702 --> 00:06:00.895
If you can get a hashtag
trending on Twitter,

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.034
or chum the waters with fake news

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:06.499
directed to audiences
primed to receive it,

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:09.400
or drive journalists to dissect
terabytes of email

00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:11.399
for a cent of impropriety --

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:14.065
all tactics used in Russian operations --

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.380
then you've got a shot at effectively
camouflaging your operations

00:06:18.404 --> 00:06:20.208
in the mind of your target.

00:06:21.867 --> 00:06:25.699
This is what Russia's long called
"reflexive control."

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.631
It's the ability to use
information on someone else

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:32.839
so that they make a decision

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:34.414
on their own accord

00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:35.981
that's favorable to you.

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.370
This is nation-state-grade image control
and perception management,

00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:44.712
and it's conducted by any means,

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:49.035
with any tools, network-based
or otherwise, that will achieve it.

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:51.241
Take this for another example.

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:56.218
In early February 2014, a few weeks
before Russia would invade Crimea,

00:06:56.242 --> 00:06:58.471
a phone call is posted on YouTube.

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:00.870
In it, there's two US diplomats.

00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:04.088
They sound like they're playing
kingmaker in Ukraine,

00:07:04.112 --> 00:07:07.555
and worse, they curse the EU
for its lack of speed and leadership

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.165
in resolving the crisis.

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:12.526
The media covers the phone call,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.888
and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash

00:07:17.183 --> 00:07:19.518
leaves Washington and Europe reeling.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:25.041
And it creates a fissured response
and a feckless attitude

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:27.195
towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.

00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:29.653
Mission accomplished.

00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:34.028
So while hacked phone calls
and emails and networks

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:36.098
keep grabbing the headlines,

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.756
the real operations are the ones

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.588
that are influencing
the decisions you make

00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:43.430
and the opinions you hold,

00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:47.328
all in the service of a nation-state's
strategic interest.

00:07:47.944 --> 00:07:49.955
This is power in the information age.

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:54.971
And this information is all
that much more seductive,

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.782
all that much easier to take
at face value and pass on,

00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:00.188
when it's authentic.

00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:06.271
Who's not interested in the truth
that's presented in phone calls and emails

00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:09.146
that were never intended
for public consumption?

00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.995
But how meaningful is that truth

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:14.459
if you don't know why
it's being revealed to you?

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:20.154
We must recognize that this place
where we're increasingly living,

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:22.463
which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,"

00:08:22.487 --> 00:08:24.693
isn't defined by ones and zeroes,

00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:27.706
but by information
and the people behind it.

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.971
This is far more than a network
of computers and devices.

00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:35.147
This is a network composed of minds

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.570
interacting with computers and devices.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.851
And for this network,

00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:46.009
there's no encryption,
there's no firewall,

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:47.756
no two-factor authentication,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.656
no password complex enough to protect you.

00:08:51.568 --> 00:08:53.982
What you have for defense

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:58.453
is far stronger, it's more adaptable,
it's always running the latest version.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.235
It's the ability to think critically:

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:03.978
call out falsehood,

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.429
press for the facts.

00:09:06.802 --> 00:09:10.995
And above all, you must have the courage

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:13.967
to unflinchingly pursue the truth.

00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:20.790
(Applause)
