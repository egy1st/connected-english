00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.536
Chris Anderson:
Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.936
It's great to have you here.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.536
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.416
CA: So, in the next half hour or so,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.256
we're going to spend some time

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.176
exploring your vision for what
an exciting future might look like,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.296
which I guess makes
the first question a little ironic:

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.056
Why are you boring?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.296
EM: Yeah.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.870
I ask myself that frequently.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.376
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.576
and this is to create the beginning

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.720
of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.736
to alleviate congestion.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.296
So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.176
It affects people
in every part of the world.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.016
It takes away so much of your life.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.016
It's horrible.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.656
It's particularly horrible in LA.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.336
(Laughter)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.296
CA: I think you've brought with you

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.775
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.136
Can I show this?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.856
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time --

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.736
Just to show what we're talking about.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.896
So a couple of key things
that are important

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.816
in having a 3D tunnel network.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.456
First of all, you have to be able

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.736
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.816
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.496
So by having an elevator,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.296
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.256
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520
just by using two parking spaces.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.936
And then the car gets on a skate.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.336
There's no speed limit here,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.376
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.616
CA: How much?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.960
EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.016
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.296
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.656
(Applause)

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.256
CA: So possibly, initially done,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.576
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.816
EM: Yeah.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.896
CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.616
from the surface streets as well.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.256
EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.416
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.256
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.456
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.736
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.056
with a 3D tunnel network.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.616
This is a very important point.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.016
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.816
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.136
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.576
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.936
any number of levels.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.496
CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.296
and that would block this idea.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.016
EM: Yeah.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.256
Well, they're right.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.056
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.736
which is -- I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.999
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:17.416
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.416
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.936
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.136
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.480
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.840
CA: And how could you achieve that?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.296
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.656
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.856
and I think you can go beyond that.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.136
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.776
by a factor of two or more.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.776
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.656
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.856
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.136
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.736
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.416
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.656
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.576
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.456
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.696
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.616
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.816
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.136
for the tunnel wall.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.376
So if you design the machine instead

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.736
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.976
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.216
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.896
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.976
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.136
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.336
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.576
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.576
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.336
in the cost per mile,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.296
and our target actually is --

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.136
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.696
this is from Gary the snail
from "South Park,"

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.656
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.256
(Laughter)

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.696
So Gary is capable of --

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.816
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.616
than a tunnel-boring machine.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.416
(Laughter)

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.216
CA: You want to beat Gary.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.536
EM: We want to beat Gary.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.096
(Laughter)

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.336
He's not a patient little fellow,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.456
and that will be victory.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.880
Victory is beating the snail.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.336
CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.256
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.496
You go aboveground.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.336
Why isn't that a better solution?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.336
You save all that tunneling cost.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.576
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.456
Obviously, I do rockets,
so I like things that fly.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.416
This is not some inherent bias
against flying things,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.496
but there is a challenge with flying cars

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.816
in that they'll be quite noisy,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.400
the wind force generated
will be very high.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.696
Let's just say that if something's
flying over your head,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.280
a whole bunch of flying cars
going all over the place,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.056
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.400
(Laughter)

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.760
You don't think to yourself,
"Well, I feel better about today."

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.136
You're thinking,
"Did they service their hubcap,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.056
or is it going to come off
and guillotine me?"

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.760
Things like that.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.896
CA: So you've got this vision

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.216
of future cities with these rich,
3D networks of tunnels underneath.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.256
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.816
Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.221
you released a few years ago.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.056
EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.696
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.536
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.696
just for a student competition,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.736
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.776
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720
after the Large Hadron Collider,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.000
by volume.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.776
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.496
and then we think we might --

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.880
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.376
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.829
if it's not pushing something.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.056
So we're cautiously optimistic

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.096
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.376
even in a .8-mile stretch.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.936
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.216
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.856
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.456
CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.296
running quite long distances.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.016
EM: Exactly.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.816
And looking at tunneling technology,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.376
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.600
you have to --

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.696
In order to seal against the water table,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.376
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.720
to about five or six atmospheres.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.176
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.616
or near-vacuum.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.056
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.056
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.496
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.136
CA: Huh.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.696
EM: So, yeah.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.576
CA: And so you could actually picture,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.296
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.536
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.576
You could dig as much as you want.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.816
I think if you were to do something

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.016
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.896
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.536
because it's a high-density area.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.616
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.176
and if you go deep enough,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.576
you cannot detect the tunnel.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.536
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.416
to have a tunnel dug under my house.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.776
Like, if that tunnel is dug

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.976
more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.880
you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.576
In fact, if you're able
to detect the tunnel being dug,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.216
whatever device you are using,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.506
you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.326
who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,

00:09:55.636 --> 00:10:00.416
and from the US Customs and Border patrol
that try and detect drug tunnels.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.656
So the reality is

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.536
that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.536
and once the tunnel depth
is below a certain level,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.536
it is undetectable.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.136
Maybe if you have a very sensitive
seismic instrument,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.640
you might be able to detect it.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.656
CA: So you've started
a new company to do this

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.376
called The Boring Company.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.336
Very nice. Very funny.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.736
(Laughter)

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.256
EM: What's funny about that?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.896
(Laughter)

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.840
CA: How much of your time is this?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.720
EM: It's maybe ...

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.880
two or three percent.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.856
CA: You've called it a hobby.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.496
This is what an Elon Musk
hobby looks like.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.536
(Laughter)

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.016
EM: I mean, it really is, like --

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.920
This is basically interns
and people doing it part time.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.016
We bought some second-hand machinery.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.160
It's kind of puttering along,
but it's making good progress, so --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.896
CA: So an even bigger part of your time

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.200
is being spent on electrifying
cars and transport through Tesla.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.016
Is one of the motivations
for the tunneling project

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.576
the realization that actually,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.016
in a world where cars are electric
and where they're self-driving,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.576
there may end up being
more cars on the roads

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.976
on any given hour than there are now?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.920
EM: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.336
A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.976
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.896
And to some degree that will be true,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.976
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.440
and you can go point to point,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.096
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.336
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.416
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.296
and actually traffic will get far worse.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.576
CA: You started Tesla
with the goal of persuading the world

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.736
that electrification
was the future of cars,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.136
and a few years ago,
people were laughing at you.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.616
Now, not so much.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.856
EM: OK.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.816
(Laughter)

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.056
I don't know. I don't know.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.496
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
every auto manufacturer

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.536
has announced
serious electrification plans

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.200
for the short- to medium-term future?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.200
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.256
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.536
They vary in seriousness.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.856
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.240
and some are just dabbling in it.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.696
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.856
but I think that won't last much longer.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.936
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.656
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, "We did it."

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.760
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.720
EM: Yeah.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.896
I intend to stay with Tesla
as far into the future as I can imagine,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.576
and there are a lot of exciting
things that we have coming.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.776
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.200
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.056
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.056
So Model 3, it's supposed
to be coming in July-ish.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.616
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.016
CA: Wow.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.416
One of the things
that people are so excited about

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.656
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.016
And you put out this video a while back

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.376
showing what that technology
would look like.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.616
EM: Yeah.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.126
CA: There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.536
What are we seeing here?

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:57.576
EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.096
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.160
This is just using passive optical,
which is essentially what a person uses.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.696
The whole road system
is meant to be navigated

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.776
with passive optical, or cameras,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.136
and so once you solve cameras

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.400
or vision,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.216
then autonomy is solved.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.520
If you don't solve vision,
it's not solved.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.136
So that's why our focus is
so heavily on having a vision neural net

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.376
that's very effective for road conditions.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.016
CA: Right. Many other people
are going the LIDAR route.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.896
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.296
EM: You can absolutely
be superhuman with just cameras.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.336
Like, you can probably do it
ten times better than humans would,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.616
just cameras.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.096
CA: So the new cars being sold right now
have eight cameras in them.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.456
They can't yet do what that showed.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.120
When will they be able to?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.176
EM: I think we're still on track
for being able to go cross-country

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.376
from LA to New York by the end
of the year, fully autonomous.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.176
CA: OK, so by the end
of the year, you're saying,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.176
someone's going to sit in a Tesla
without touching the steering wheel,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.696
tap in "New York," off it goes.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.936
EM: Yeah.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.160
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --
by the end of 2017.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.896
EM: Yeah. Essentially,
November or December of this year,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.336
we should be able to go all the way
from a parking lot in California

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.016
to a parking lot in New York,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.880
no controls touched at any point
during the entire journey.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.816
(Applause)

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.056
CA: Amazing.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.496
But part of that is possible

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.936
because you've already got a fleet
of Teslas driving all these roads.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.760
You're accumulating a huge amount
of data of that national road system.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.096
EM: Yes, but the thing
that will be interesting

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.200
is that I'm actually fairly confident
it will be able to do that route

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.200
even if you change the route dynamically.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.240
So, it's fairly easy --

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.776
If you say I'm going to be really good
at one specific route, that's one thing,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.936
but it should be able to go,
really be very good,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.696
certainly once you enter a highway,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.496
to go anywhere on the highway system

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.760
in a given country.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.336
So it's not sort of limited
to LA to New York.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.816
We could change it
and make it Seattle-Florida,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.376
that day, in real time.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.536
So you were going from LA to New York.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.280
Now go from LA to Toronto.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.056
CA: So leaving aside
regulation for a second,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.856
in terms of the technology alone,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.696
the time when someone
will be able to buy one of your cars

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.536
and literally just take the hands
off the wheel and go to sleep

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.616
and wake up and find that they've arrived,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.576
how far away is that, to do that safely?

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.856
EM: I think that's about two years.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.256
So the real trick of it
is not how do you make it work

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.215
say 99.9 percent of the time,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.336
because, like, if a car crashes
one in a thousand times,

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:12.336
then you're probably still not going
to be comfortable falling asleep.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.040
You shouldn't be, certainly.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.540
(Laughter)

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.935
It's never going to be perfect.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.695
No system is going to be perfect,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.319
but if you say it's perhaps --

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.936
the car is unlikely to crash

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.416
in a hundred lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.336
then people are like, OK, wow,
if I were to live a thousand lives,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.976
I would still most likely
never experience a crash,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.376
then that's probably OK.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.616
CA: To sleep.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.496
I guess the big concern of yours
is that people may actually

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.816
get seduced too early
to think that this is safe,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.376
and that you'll have some horrible
incident happen that puts things back.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.416
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
is likely to at least mitigate the crash,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.920
except in rare circumstances.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.576
The thing to appreciate
about vehicle safety

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.000
is this is probabilistic.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.376
I mean, there's some chance that any time
a human driver gets in a car,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.336
that they will have an accident
that is their fault.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.680
It's never zero.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.816
So really the key threshold for autonomy

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.256
is how much better does autonomy
need to be than a person

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.656
before you can rely on it?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.096
CA: But once you get
literally safe hands-off driving,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.936
the power to disrupt
the whole industry seems massive,

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.336
because at that point you've spoken
of people being able to buy a car,

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.496
drops you off at work,
and then you let it go

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.496
and provide a sort of Uber-like
service to other people,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.736
earn you money,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.216
maybe even cover the cost
of your lease of that car,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.096
so you can kind of get a car for free.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.376
Is that really likely?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.256
EM: Yeah. Absolutely
this is what will happen.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.256
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.536
where you buy your car

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.976
and you can choose
to use that car exclusively,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.696
you could choose to have it be used
only by friends and family,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.776
only by other drivers
who are rated five star,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.680
you can choose to share it sometimes
but not other times.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.416
That's 100 percent what will occur.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.821
It's just a question of when.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.176
CA: Wow.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.416
So you mentioned the Semi

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.176
and I think you're planning
to announce this in September,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.296
but I'm curious whether there's
anything you could show us today?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.176
EM: I will show you
a teaser shot of the truck.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.696
(Laughter)

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.656
It's alive.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.896
CA: OK.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.616
EM: That's definitely a case
where we want to be cautious

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.974
about the autonomy features.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.576
Yeah.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.216
(Laughter)

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.856
CA: We can't see that much of it,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.096
but it doesn't look like
just a little friendly neighborhood truck.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.376
It looks kind of badass.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.560
What sort of semi is this?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.736
EM: So this is a heavy duty,
long-range semitruck.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.016
So it's the highest weight capability

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.096
and with long range.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.560
So essentially it's meant to alleviate
the heavy-duty trucking loads.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.576
And this is something which
people do not today think is possible.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.336
They think the truck doesn't have enough
power or it doesn't have enough range,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.896
and then with the Tesla Semi

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.576
we want to show that no, an electric truck

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:37.616
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.776
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.856
the Tesla Semi
will tug the diesel semi uphill.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.136
(Laughter)

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.016
(Applause)

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.056
CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.400
These are going to be trucks
that truck drivers want to drive.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.096
EM: Yes. So what will be
really fun about this

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.496
is you have a flat torque RPM curve
with an electric motor,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.016
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
of internal combustion engine car,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.640
you've got a torque RPM curve
that looks like a hill.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.776
So this will be a very spry truck.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.656
You can drive this
around like a sports car.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.056
There's no gears.
It's, like, single speed.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.536
CA: There's a great movie
to be made here somewhere.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.336
I don't know what it is
and I don't know that it ends well,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.576
but it's a great movie.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.616
(Laughter)

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.376
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.416
When I was driving the test prototype
for the first truck.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.696
It's really weird,
because you're driving around

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.816
and you're just so nimble,
and you're in this giant truck.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.336
CA: Wait, you've
already driven a prototype?

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.456
EM: Yeah, I drove it
around the parking lot,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.936
and I was like, this is crazy.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.136
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.256
EM: It's just like,
driving this giant truck

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.256
and making these mad maneuvers.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.736
CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.376
to a kind of less badass picture.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.736
This is just a cute house
from "Desperate Housewives" or something.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.816
What on earth is going on here?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.296
EM: Well, this illustrates
the picture of the future

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.296
that I think is how things will evolve.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.656
You've got an electric car
in the driveway.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.416
If you look in between
the electric car and the house,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.296
there are actually three Powerwalls
stacked up against the side of the house,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.136
and then that house roof is a solar roof.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.256
So that's an actual solar glass roof.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.496
CA: OK.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.776
EM: That's a picture of a real --
well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.456
That's a real fake house.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.576
(Laughter)

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.456
CA: So these roof tiles,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.616
some of them have in them
basically solar power, the ability to --

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.336
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.456
where you can adjust
the texture and the color

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.456
to a very fine-grained level,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.056
and then there's
sort of microlouvers in the glass,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.536
such that when you're looking
at the roof from street level

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.256
or close to street level,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.656
all the tiles look the same

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.760
whether there is a solar cell
behind it or not.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.416
So you have an even color

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.936
from the ground level.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.056
If you were to look at it
from a helicopter,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.456
you would be actually able
to look through and see

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.496
that some of the glass tiles have
a solar cell behind them and some do not.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.136
You can't tell from street level.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.216
CA: You put them in the ones
that are likely to see a lot of sun,

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.616
and that makes these roofs
super affordable, right?

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.616
They're not that much more expensive
than just tiling the roof.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.840
EM: Yeah.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.440
We're very confident
that the cost of the roof

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.760
plus the cost of electricity --

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.856
A solar glass roof will be less
than the cost of a normal roof

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.296
plus the cost of electricity.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.576
So in other words,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.936
this will be economically a no-brainer,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.656
we think it will look great,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.816
and it will last --

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.896
We thought about having
the warranty be infinity,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.136
but then people thought,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.736
well, that might sound
like were just talking rubbish,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.376
but actually this is toughened glass.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.296
Well after the house has collapsed

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.216
and there's nothing there,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.776
the glass tiles will still be there.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.376
(Applause)

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.136
CA: I mean, this is cool.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.016
So you're rolling this out
in a couple week's time, I think,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.576
with four different roofing types.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.136
EM: Yeah, we're starting off
with two, two initially,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.336
and the second two
will be introduced early next year.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.416
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.960
How many houses do you believe
could end up having this type of roofing?

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.160
EM: I think eventually

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.200
almost all houses will have a solar roof.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.416
The thing is to consider
the time scale here

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.896
to be probably on the order

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.096
of 40 or 50 years.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.000
So on average, a roof
is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.736
But you don't start replacing
all roofs immediately.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.096
But eventually,
if you say were to fast-forward

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.576
to say 15 years from now,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.200
it will be unusual to have a roof
that does not have solar.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.696
CA: Is there a mental model thing
that people don't get here

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.136
that because of the shift in the cost,
the economics of solar power,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.256
most houses actually have
enough sunlight on their roof

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.336
pretty much to power all of their needs.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.256
If you could capture the power,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.336
it could pretty much
power all their needs.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.896
You could go off-grid, kind of.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.456
EM: It depends on where you are

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.736
and what the house size is
relative to the roof area,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.616
but it's a fair statement to say

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.456
that most houses in the US
have enough roof area

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.440
to power all the needs of the house.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.976
CA: So the key to the economics

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.016
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.936
is the falling price
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.456
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.736
In many ways, that's almost
the core competency.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.016
And you've decided

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.256
that to really, like, own that competency,

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.736
you just have to build
the world's largest manufacturing plant

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.896
to double the world's supply
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.216
with this guy. What is this?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.696
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.416
progress so far on the Gigafactory.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.336
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.296
that there's sort of
a diamond shape overall,

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.936
and when it's fully done,
it'll look like a giant diamond,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.176
or that's the idea behind it,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.696
and it's aligned on true north.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.456
It's a small detail.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.376
CA: And capable of producing, eventually,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.576
like a hundred gigawatt hours
of batteries a year.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.576
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
We think probably more, but yeah.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.976
CA: And they're actually
being produced right now.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.176
EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.536
I mean, is that speeded up?

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.256
EM: That's the slowed down version.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.056
(Laughter)

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.416
CA: How fast does it actually go?

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.256
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.216
you can't actually see the cells
without a strobe light.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.440
It's just blur.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.876
(Laughter)

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.576
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
about what makes an exciting future

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.240
is a future where we no longer
feel guilty about energy.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.896
Help us picture this.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.936
How many Gigafactories, if you like,
does it take to get us there?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.696
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.456
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.840
Most likely a hundred.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.696
CA: See, I find this amazing.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.696
You can picture what it would take

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.976
to move the world
off this vast fossil fuel thing.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.576
It's like you're building one,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.456
it costs five billion dollars,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.616
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.256
Like, it's kind of cool
that you can picture that project.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.760
And you're planning to do, at Tesla --
announce another two this year.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.336
EM: I think we'll announce locations

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.096
for somewhere between two
and four Gigafactories later this year.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.560
Yeah, probably four.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.656
CA: Whoa.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.296
(Applause)

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.376
No more teasing from you for here?

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.200
Like -- where, continent?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.680
You can say no.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.216
EM: We need to address a global market.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.456
CA: OK.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.816
(Laughter)

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.040
This is cool.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.720
I think we should talk for --

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.176
Actually, global market.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.296
I'm going to ask you one question
about politics, only one.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.576
I'm kind of sick of politics,
but I do want to ask you this.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.936
You're on a body now
giving advice to a guy --

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.176
EM: Who?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.096
CA: Who has said he doesn't
really believe in climate change,

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.456
and there's a lot of people out there
who think you shouldn't be doing that.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.376
They'd like you to walk away from that.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.760
What would you say to them?

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.336
EM: Well, I think that first of all,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.896
I'm just on two advisory councils

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.736
where the format consists
of going around the room

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.656
and asking people's opinion on things,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.440
and so there's like a meeting
every month or two.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.776
That's the sum total of my contribution.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.576
But I think to the degree
that there are people in the room

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.336
who are arguing in favor
of doing something about climate change,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.360
or social issues,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.736
I've used the meetings I've had thus far

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.616
to argue in favor of immigration
and in favor of climate change.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.576
(Applause)

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.696
And if I hadn't done that,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.536
that wasn't on the agenda before.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.800
So maybe nothing will happen,
but at least the words were said.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.896
CA: OK.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.800
(Applause)

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.336
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.816
Last time you were here,

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.536
you spoke about what seemed like
a kind of incredibly ambitious dream

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.856
to develop rockets
that were actually reusable.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.016
And you've only gone and done it.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.656
EM: Finally. It took a long time.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.256
CA: Talk us through this.
What are we looking at here?

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.416
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.016
coming back from
very high and fast in space.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.296
So just delivered the upper stage

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.416
at high velocity.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.296
I think this might have been
at sort of Mach 7 or so,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.280
delivery of the upper stage.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.880
(Applause)

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.336
CA: So that was a sped-up --

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.176
EM: That was the slowed down version.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.536
(Laughter)

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.056
CA: I thought that was
the sped-up version.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.416
But I mean, that's amazing,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.776
and several of these failed

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.736
before you finally
figured out how to do it,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.656
but now you've done this,
what, five or six times?

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.976
EM: We're at eight or nine.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.616
CA: And for the first time,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.776
you've actually reflown
one of the rockets that landed.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.576
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.216
and then prepped it for flight again
and flew it again,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.416
so it's the first reflight
of an orbital booster

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.416
where that reflight is relevant.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.616
So it's important to appreciate
that reusability is only relevant

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.720
if it is rapid and complete.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.656
So like an aircraft or a car,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.056
the reusability is rapid and complete.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.136
You do not send your aircraft
to Boeing in-between flights.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.976
CA: Right. So this is allowing you
to dream of this really ambitious idea

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.176
of sending many, many, many people to Mars

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.616
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.016
EM: Yeah.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.456
CA: And you've designed
this outrageous rocket to do it.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.896
Help us understand
the scale of this thing.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.800
EM: Well, visually
you can see that's a person.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.496
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.176
(Laughter)

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.936
CA: So if that was a skyscraper,

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.296
that's like, did I read that,
a 40-story skyscraper?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.920
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.360
The thrust level of this is really --

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.280
This configuration is about four times
the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:49.296
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
rocket humanity ever created before.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.520
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.096
CA: As one does.
EM: Yeah.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.096
(Laughter)

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.096
In units of 747, a 747 is only about
a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.216
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.936
there's 40 747s.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.216
So this would be the thrust equivalent
of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.456
CA: And so even with a machine
designed to escape Earth's gravity,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.896
I think you told me last time

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.176
this thing could actually
take a fully loaded 747,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.536
people, cargo, everything,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.816
into orbit.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.976
EM: Exactly. This can take
a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.496
maximum passengers,
maximum cargo on the 747 --

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.760
this can take it as cargo.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.816
CA: So based on this,

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.656
you presented recently
this Interplanetary Transport System

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.056
which is visualized this way.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.160
This is a scene you picture in, what,
30 years time? 20 years time?

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.456
People walking into this rocket.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.056
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
an eight- to 10-year time frame.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.456
Aspirationally, that's our target.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.496
Our internal targets
are more aggressive, but I think --

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.679
(Laughter)

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.815
CA: OK.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.976
EM: While vehicle seems quite large

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.176
and is large by comparison
with other rockets,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:21.176
I think the future spacecraft

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:25.040
will make this look like a rowboat.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.016
The future spaceships
will be truly enormous.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.216
CA: Why, Elon?

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:37.376
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.456
with a million people
on it in your lifetime,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.480
which I think is kind of
what you've said you'd love to do?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.239
EM: I think it's important to have

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.856
a future that is inspiring and appealing.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.656
I just think there have to be reasons

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.616
that you get up in the morning
and you want to live.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.096
Like, why do you want to live?

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.856
What's the point? What inspires you?

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.736
What do you love about the future?

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.256
And if we're not out there,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.296
if the future does not include
being out there among the stars

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.016
and being a multiplanet species,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.536
I find that it's incredibly depressing

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.896
if that's not the future
that we're going to have.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.096
(Applause)

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.456
CA: People want to position this
as an either or,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.176
that there are so many desperate things
happening on the planet now

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.640
from climate to poverty
to, you know, you pick your issue.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.016
And this feels like a distraction.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.856
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.056
You should be solving what's here and now.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.016
And to be fair, you've done
a fair old bit to actually do that

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.856
with your work on sustainable energy.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.920
But why not just do that?

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.440
EM: I think there's --

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.256
I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.456
It's like a branching
stream of probabilities,

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.480
and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.120
or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.120
I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.016
Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.536
If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.416
it would have to happen out of necessity.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.016
It's tautological.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.696
If you don't have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.336
Eventually you will run out,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:39.176
and the laws of economics
will drive civilization

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.856
towards sustainable energy,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.096
inevitably.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.096
The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.536
is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.322
faster than it would otherwise occur.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.336
So when I think, like,

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.096
what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.816
I would say, hopefully,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.456
if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.616
that would be quite a good thing to occur.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.256
That's what I consider to be

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.360
the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:19.816
Then there's becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.776
This is not inevitable.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.496
It's very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.616
The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.376
but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.576
If you look at the progress in space,

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.200
in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.240
1969.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.736
Then we had the Space Shuttle.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.176
The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.736
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.160
and the United States
could take no one to orbit.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.576
So that's the trend.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.280
The trend is like down to nothing.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.936
People are mistaken when they think

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.056
that technology
just automatically improves.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.976
It does not automatically improve.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.656
It only improves if a lot of people
work very hard to make it better,

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:16.456
and actually it will, I think,
by itself degrade, actually.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.896
You look at great civilizations
like Ancient Egypt,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.856
and they were able to make the pyramids,

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.696
and they forgot how to do that.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.536
And then the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.760
They forgot how to do it.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.776
CA: Elon, it almost seems,
listening to you

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.056
and looking at the different
things you've done,

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.856
that you've got this unique
double motivation on everything

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.200
that I find so interesting.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.296
One is this desire to work
for humanity's long-term good.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.656
The other is the desire
to do something exciting.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.376
And often it feels like you feel
like you need the one to drive the other.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.496
With Tesla, you want
to have sustainable energy,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.056
so you made these super sexy,
exciting cars to do it.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.776
Solar energy, we need to get there,

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.753
so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

00:39:02.777 --> 00:39:04.976
We haven't even spoken
about your newest thing,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.536
which we don't have time to do,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.896
but you want to save humanity from bad AI,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.216
and so you're going to create
this really cool brain-machine interface

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.096
to give us all infinite memory
and telepathy and so forth.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.816
And on Mars, it feels
like what you're saying is,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.536
yeah, we need to save humanity

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.936
and have a backup plan,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.216
but also we need to inspire humanity,

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.760
and this is a way to inspire.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.456
EM: I think the value
of beauty and inspiration

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.456
is very much underrated,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.056
no question.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.336
But I want to be clear.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.176
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.400
That is not the --

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.016
I'm just trying to think about the future

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.240
and not be sad.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.496
(Applause)

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.720
CA: Beautiful statement.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.776
I think everyone here would agree

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.000
that it is not --

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.856
None of this is going
to happen inevitably.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.536
The fact that in your mind,
you dream this stuff,

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.136
you dream stuff that no one else
would dare dream,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.816
or no one else
would be capable of dreaming

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.496
at the level of complexity that you do.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.696
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,
is a really remarkable thing.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.416
Thank you for helping us all
to dream a bit bigger.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.936
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever
starts getting genuinely insane, right?

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.456
(Laughter)

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.576
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
That was really, really fantastic.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.016
That was really fantastic.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.120
(Applause)
