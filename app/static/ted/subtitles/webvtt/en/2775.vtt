00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.301
Getting a college education

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:05.480
is a 20-year investment.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.055
When you're growing up poor,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.016
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.376
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.256
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.416
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.080
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.816
It wasn't until I was a teenager

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.320
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.736
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.080
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
I was no different.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.336
I'm the second-oldest of seven,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.776
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.000
in Queens, New York.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.656
By virtue of growing up low-income,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.016
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.560
most struggling public schools.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
because I didn't feel like going to class.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.936
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.256
and even worse,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.576
only 20 percent of the kids graduating

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.800
were college-ready.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.096
When I actually did make it to college,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.536
I told my friend Brennan

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.256
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280
if we were going to college.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.136
I was taken aback when Brennan said,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.840
"Karim, I've never been asked
that question before."

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.696
It was always, "What college
are you going to?"

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.656
Just the way that question is phrased

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.440
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000
Nowadays I get asked a different question.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.960
"How were you able to make it out?"

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.120
For years I said I was lucky,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.520
but it's not just luck.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.856
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.136
at the very same time

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.376
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.856
I wanted to understand why he dropped out

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.080
and I kept studying.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.616
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.376
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.175
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.000
and attending the schools that I did.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.760
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.656
I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.336
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.056
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.880
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.336
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.616
where people are saying,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.656
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
or these poor black and Latino kids,"

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.696
instead of an empathetic approach,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.136
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.376
"I know the adversities that you're facing

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.240
and I want to help you overcome them."

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.256
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.776
I share that one of the biggest reasons

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.880
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.456
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.256
if a kid is struggling,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.216
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.176
even if they don't ask for help.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.336
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.600
and doesn't ask for help,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.560
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.536
So seven years ago,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.376
I started to reform
our public education system

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.720
shaped by my firsthand perspective.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.532
And I started with summer school.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.296
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.656
which is the disparity
in educational attainment

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.856
between rich kids and poor kids

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.016
or black kids and white kids,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.720
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.456
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.536
of what they learned
during the school year

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.896
over the summer.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.536
They return to school in the fall,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.616
and their teachers
spend another two months

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.056
reteaching them old material.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.576
That's five months.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.216
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.856
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
that's half of their education.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.320
Half.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.240
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.320
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.976
For kids it feels like punishment,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.336
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.816
when the school year
ends the last week of June

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.200
and then summer school starts
just one week later?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.536
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.816
sort out the logistics,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.040
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.736
But what if we created a program
over the summer

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.456
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.480
to develop aspiring educators?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.456
What if we empowered
college-educated role models

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.760
as teaching fellows

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.096
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.376
What if empowered high-achieving kids

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.816
as mentors to tutor their younger peers

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.160
and inspire them
to invest in their education?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.376
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.616
asked them what colleges
they were going to,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.600
designed a summer school
they want to attend

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.936
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.160
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.896
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.856
trained over 300 aspiring teachers

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.176
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.240
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.800
(Applause)

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.176
And our kids are succeeding.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.176
Two years of independent evaluations

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.136
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.336
and make growth of one month in math

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.600
and two months in reading.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.696
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.360
they now go back four months ahead in math

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.616
and five months ahead in reading.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.040
(Applause)

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.696
Ten years ago, if you would have told me

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.896
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.896
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.960
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.416
I would have said,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.560
"Nah. No way."

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.216
What's even more exciting

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.416
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.400
just by redesigning two months,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.136
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.720
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.376
Thank you.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.061
(Applause)
