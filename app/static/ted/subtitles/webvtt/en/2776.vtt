00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:05.817
In 1956, a documentary
by Jacques Cousteau won

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.842
both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.727
This film was called,
"Le Monde Du Silence,"

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.843
or, "The Silent World."

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:19.777
The premise of the title was that
the underwater world was a quiet world.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.774
We now know, 60 years later,

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.234
that the underwater world
is anything but silent.

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:29.684
Although the sounds
are inaudible above water

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.018
depending on where you are
and the time of year,

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:38.900
the underwater soundscape can be as noisy
as any jungle or rainforest.

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:44.649
Invertebrates like snapping shrimp,
fish and marine mammals

00:00:44.673 --> 00:00:45.878
all use sound.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:49.267
They use sound to study their habitat,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.593
to keep in communication with each other,

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:52.900
to navigate,

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:55.133
to detect predators and prey.

00:00:55.737 --> 00:01:01.026
They also use sound by listening
to know something about their environment.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.729
Take, for an example, the Arctic.

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:06.981
It's considered a vast,
inhospitable place,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.586
sometimes described as a desert,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.543
because it is so cold and so remote

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.778
and ice-covered for much of the year.

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:16.981
And despite this,

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:21.049
there is no place on Earth
that I would rather be than the Arctic,

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:24.712
especially as days lengthen
and spring comes.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:29.767
To me, the Arctic really
embodies this disconnect

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:35.047
between what we see on the surface
and what's going on underwater.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:40.691
You can look out across the ice --
all white and blue and cold --

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.987
and see nothing.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.290
But if you could hear underwater,

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.695
the sounds you would hear
would at first amaze

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.806
and then delight you.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.852
And while your eyes are seeing
nothing for kilometers but ice,

00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:01.339
your ears are telling you that out there
are bowhead and beluga whales,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:03.639
walrus and bearded seals.

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.570
The ice, too, makes sounds.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:10.078
It screeches and cracks
and pops and groans,

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:15.056
as it collides and rubs when temperature
or currents or winds change.

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.931
And under 100 percent sea ice
in the dead of winter,

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:23.091
bowhead whales are singing.

00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:26.114
And you would never expect that,

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:28.329
because we humans,

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.950
we tend to be very visual animals.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.479
For most of us, but not all,

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:37.041
our sense of sight is how
we navigate our world.

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.417
For marine mammals that live underwater,

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.304
where chemical cues
and light transmit poorly,

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:48.403
sound is the sense by which they see.

00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:50.741
And sound transmits very well underwater,

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.697
much better than it does in air,

00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.715
so signals can be heard
over great distances.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.361
In the Arctic, this
is especially important,

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:03.298
because not only do Arctic marine
mammals have to hear each other,

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:06.433
but they also have to listen
for cues in the environment

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.365
that might indicate
heavy ice ahead or open water.

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:14.261
Remember, although they spend
most of their lives underwater,

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:15.509
they are mammals,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.812
and so they have to surface to breathe.

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:22.314
So they might listen
for thin ice or no ice,

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:25.387
or listen for echoes off nearby ice.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:32.214
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich
and varied underwater soundscape.

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:33.968
In the spring,

00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:36.126
it can be a cacophony of sound.

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.215
(Marine mammal sounds)

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.059
But when the ice is frozen solid,

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:59.791
and there are no big temperature
shifts or current changes,

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:04.114
the underwater Arctic has some
of the lowest ambient noise levels

00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:05.858
of the world's oceans.

00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:07.204
But this is changing.

00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:10.892
This is primarily due to a decrease
in seasonal sea ice,

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:15.388
which is a direct result of human
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:19.260
We are, in effect, with climate change,

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:22.958
conducting a completely uncontrolled
experiment with our planet.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.854
Over the past 30 years,

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:29.731
areas of the Arctic have seen
decreases in seasonal sea ice

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:34.170
from anywhere from
six weeks to four months.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.430
This decrease in sea ice is sometimes
referred to as an increase

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:41.317
in the open water season.

00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.852
That is the time of year when
the Arctic is navigable to vessels.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.214
And not only is the extent
of ice changing,

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:52.674
but the age and the width of ice is, too.

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:54.814
Now, you may well have heard

00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:58.321
that a decrease in seasonal sea ice
is causing a loss of habitat

00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.476
for animals that rely on sea ice,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.073
such as ice seals,
or walrus, or polar bears.

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:09.697
Decreasing sea ice is also causing
increased erosion along coastal villages,

00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.287
and changing prey availability
for marine birds and mammals.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.397
Climate change and decreases in sea ice

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:21.936
are also altering the underwater
soundscape of the Arctic.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.098
What do I mean by soundscape?

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:28.690
Those of us who eavesdrop
on the oceans for a living

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:30.968
use instruments called hydrophones,

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:33.037
which are underwater microphones,

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.007
and we record ambient noise --

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:36.955
the noise all around us.

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.320
And the soundscape describes
the different contributors

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:41.861
to this noise field.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:45.344
What we are hearing on our hydrophones

00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:48.903
are the very real sounds
of climate change.

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:52.141
We are hearing these changes
from three fronts:

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:54.603
from the air,

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.080
from the water

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.453
and from land.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.539
First: air.

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:04.517
Wind on water creates waves.

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:06.366
These waves make bubbles;

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.757
the bubbles break,

00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:09.287
and when they do,

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:10.514
they make noise.

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:14.442
And this noise is like a hiss
or a static in the background.

00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:18.249
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.904
most of the noise from wind
doesn't make it into the water column,

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:26.518
because the ice acts as a buffer
between the atmosphere and the water.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.345
This is one of the reasons

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.072
that the Arctic can have
very low ambient noise levels.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.464
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:39.855
not only is the Arctic now open
to this wave noise,

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.946
but the number of storms
and the intensity of storms in the Arctic

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.233
has been increasing.

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:50.214
All of this is raising noise levels
in a previously quiet ocean.

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:52.974
Second: water.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.355
With less seasonal sea ice,

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.055
subarctic species are moving north,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:03.631
and taking advantage of the new habitat
that is created by more open water.

00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:07.529
Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,

00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:09.265
they have no dorsal fin,

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.057
because they have evolved to live
and swim in ice-covered waters,

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:17.604
and having something sticking
off of your back is not very conducive

00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:19.438
to migrating through ice,

00:07:19.462 --> 00:07:23.241
and may, in fact, be excluding
animals from the ice.

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:26.482
But now, everywhere we've listened,

00:07:26.506 --> 00:07:29.564
we're hearing the sounds
of fin whales and humpback whales

00:07:29.588 --> 00:07:31.057
and killer whales,

00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.312
further and further north,

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:35.384
and later and later in the season.

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:37.415
We are hearing, in essence,

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:41.172
an invasion of the Arctic
by subarctic species.

00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:43.837
And we don't know what this means.

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:48.528
Will there be competition for food
between Arctic and subarctic animals?

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:54.163
Might these subarctic species introduce
diseases or parasites into the Arctic?

00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:57.812
And what are the new sounds
that they are producing

00:07:57.836 --> 00:08:00.226
doing to the soundscape underwater?

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.742
And third: land.

00:08:03.188 --> 00:08:04.844
And by land ...

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:06.125
I mean people.

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:10.442
More open water means
increased human use of the Arctic.

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:12.572
Just this past summer,

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:16.777
a massive cruise ship made its way
through the Northwest Passage --

00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:20.264
the once-mythical route
between Europe and the Pacific.

00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:27.767
Decreases in sea ice have allowed
humans to occupy the Arctic more often.

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:32.808
It has allowed increases in oil
and gas exploration and extraction,

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:35.462
the potential for commercial shipping,

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:37.283
as well as increased tourism.

00:08:38.394 --> 00:08:43.259
And we now know that ship noise increases
levels of stress hormones in whales

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.365
and can disrupt feeding behavior.

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:51.300
Air guns, which produce loud,
low-frequency "whoomps"

00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:53.898
every 10 to 20 seconds,

00:08:53.922 --> 00:08:57.163
changed the swimming and vocal
behavior of whales.

00:08:57.723 --> 00:09:02.661
And all of these sound sources
are decreasing the acoustic space

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:05.902
over which Arctic marine mammals
can communicate.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:11.298
Now, Arctic marine mammals
are used to very high levels of noise

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:12.803
at certain times of the year.

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:17.403
But this is primarily from other
animals or from sea ice,

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:19.923
and these are the sounds
with which they've evolved,

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:23.437
and these are sounds that are vital
to their very survival.

00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.656
These new sounds
are loud and they're alien.

00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:32.312
They might impact the environment
in ways that we think we understand,

00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:34.629
but also in ways that we don't.

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:41.799
Remember, sound is the most
important sense for these animals.

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:46.398
And not only is the physical habitat
of the Arctic changing rapidly,

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:48.638
but the acoustic habitat is, too.

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:52.803
It's as if we've plucked these animals up
from the quiet countryside

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:56.083
and dropped them into a big city
in the middle of rush hour.

00:09:56.837 --> 00:09:58.441
And they can't escape it.

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:01.694
So what can we do now?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.407
We can't decrease wind speeds

00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:08.611
or keep subarctic animals
from migrating north,

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:11.068
but we can work on local solutions

00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:13.887
to reducing human-caused underwater noise.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:17.974
One of these solutions
is to slow down ships

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:19.788
that traverse the Arctic,

00:10:19.812 --> 00:10:23.250
because a slower ship is a quieter ship.

00:10:23.934 --> 00:10:27.726
We can restrict access
in seasons and regions

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.041
that are important for mating
or feeding or migrating.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:35.801
We can get smarter about quieting ships

00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:38.577
and find better ways
to explore the ocean bottom.

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:41.670
And the good news is,

00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:44.486
there are people
working on this right now.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.741
But ultimately,

00:10:47.765 --> 00:10:50.632
we humans have to do the hard work

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.812
of reversing or at the very
least decelerating

00:10:54.836 --> 00:10:57.308
human-caused atmospheric changes.

00:10:57.332 --> 00:11:01.791
So, let's return to this idea
of a silent world underwater.

00:11:03.006 --> 00:11:04.501
It's entirely possible

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.862
that many of the whales
swimming in the Arctic today,

00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:11.421
especially long-lived species
like the bowhead whale

00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:15.202
that the Inuits say can live
two human lives --

00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:18.987
it's possible that these whales
were alive in 1956,

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.896
when Jacques Cousteau made his film.

00:11:21.877 --> 00:11:23.589
And in retrospect,

00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:27.521
considering all the noise
we are creating in the oceans today,

00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:31.704
perhaps it really was "The Silent World."

00:11:32.873 --> 00:11:34.137
Thank you.

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.565
(Applause)
