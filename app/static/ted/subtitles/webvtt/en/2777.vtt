00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:03.395
I'm going to tell you the story of a song.

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:08.258
I was in Madrid one night in 2002

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:10.585
with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.686
when he said he had something to give me.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.941
He said,

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:18.322
"Jorge, I have some lines
that you need to put into a song.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.005
Take these down, take these down."

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.033
I looked on the table but all I found
was a circular coaster,

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:25.409
on which I wrote the lines
my teacher dictated.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.906
They were four lines that went like this:

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.267
"I am a Jewish Moor
living among Christians

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.979
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are."

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:39.378
Those lines really made
an impression on me.

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:42.386
I said, "What beautiful lyrics,
Joaquín. Did you write them?"

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.888
He said no, they were by another composer
named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:50.743
who was less known than Joaquín,
but also a great poet.

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:53.292
These lines came to me at a time

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:56.122
where I had been wanting
to express something for a while,

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.786
but didn't quite know how.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.696
I was getting up to leave
and go home to write,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.210
when Joaquín stopped me
and said, "Hang on, hang on,"

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.144
and presented me with this challenge:

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.977
"Write the stanzas for this song

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.216
in Décimas."

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:13.577
Now, at this point in my life,

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:16.349
I still wasn't completely
sure what Décimas were,

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:21.659
but I was too embarrassed
to tell my teacher I didn't know.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:25.368
So I put on my best
"Yeah, I totally understand" face,

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:28.131
and went home to look up
what Décimas were.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.635
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.074
that only exists in Spanish,

00:01:33.098 --> 00:01:34.362
and that it has 10 lines.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.387
It's very, very complex --

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:39.581
perhaps the most complex style of stanza
that we have in Spanish.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.064
It also has a very concrete
date of origin,

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.422
which is very rare for a style of stanza.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:48.101
The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:54.016
by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
a musician and poet from Málaga.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.067
And listen to this coincidence:
he was the same guy

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.614
who added the sixth string

00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:02.941
to what would later be called
the Spanish guitar.

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:04.331
This string right here --

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.648
it's called the "bordona."

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:10.048
From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,

00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:14.879
crosses over to America,
just like the Spanish guitar,

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:16.433
but in contrast to the Décima,

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:18.906
the Spanish guitar continues to live today

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.619
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.735
But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.292
disappeared; it died out.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.532
It died out about 200 years ago,

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:33.220
and yet in Latin America,
from Mexico to Chile,

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:36.464
all our countries maintain
some form of the Décima

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:38.755
in our popular traditions.

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.645
In each place, they've given it
a different name,

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.200
and set it to different music.

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:49.080
It has a lot of different names --
more than 20 in total on the continent.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:52.809
In Mexico, for example,
it's called the "Son Jarocho,"

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.638
"Canto de mejorana" in Panama;

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:56.216
"Galerón" in Venezuela;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.140
"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:00.711
"Repentismo" in Cuba.

00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:03.017
In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.140
because the Décima becomes
so integrated into our traditions,

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:09.697
that if someone asks, people
from each place are completely convinced

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.476
that the Décima was invented
in their country.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.849
(Laughter)

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:16.024
It's also got a really surprising feature,

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:19.317
which is that despite the fact
that it developed independently

00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.378
in each of the different countries,

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:25.780
it maintains even today,
400 years after its creation,

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:32.249
exactly the same rhyme,
syllable and line structure --

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.703
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
during the Spanish Baroque period.

00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:37.908
Here's the structure --

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:40.958
I'll give you the basic idea
and then later you can look online

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.102
and learn more about it.

00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:46.191
The Décima is ten lines long;
each line has eight syllables.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.436
The first line rhymes
with the fourth and the fifth;

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.008
the second line, with the third;

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.839
the sixth line,
with the seventh and the tenth;

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.297
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:00.108
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:03.151
And me -- imagine me,
trying to write in Décimas.

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:06.150
But it's not as complicated as it seems.

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:10.224
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
with the same structure

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:11.839
for more than four centuries.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.332
It's not that complicated, because it has
an impressive musicality to it,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.762
a type of musicality

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.602
that's very hard to describe technically.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.689
I prefer that you listen to it.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.539
So I'm going to recite a Décima,

00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:31.124
one of the Décimas
that I wrote for this song.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.096
I'm going to ask that you concentrate
just on the musicality of the rhymes.

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:40.029
For those of you with headphones on --

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:44.816
I see that some of you are listening
to the translation --

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:47.757
please take them off for a minute.

00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:50.363
(English) Take your headphones off,
it you have them.

00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:57.425
(English) Forget about the meaning
of the words for a few seconds,

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.420
(English) and then you'll put them back.

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:01.250
(English) Forget about the structure.

00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:03.062
(Spanish) Forget about the structure.

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:08.328
(English) And just ... it's all about
the choreography of sound of the Décima.

00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:10.609
(Spanish) A choreography of sound.

00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:16.158
(Sings in Spanish) "There is not one death
that does not cause me pain,

00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:17.199
there are no winners,

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.167
here’s nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:23.568
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:05:23.592 --> 00:05:26.490
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:31.391
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth."

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:35.616
That's a Décima.

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.458
(English) You can put
your headphones back on.

00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:39.560
(Applause)

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.737
(English) Thank you.

00:05:40.761 --> 00:05:43.863
(Applause)

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:48.655
I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
because here it is 426 years later,

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:50.406
and the Décima lives on everywhere

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.628
in its original state.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.252
I wrote three like that one;
you just heard the second.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.950
I wrote the first one having only
recently learned how,

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:59.079
and it has some errors in terms of meter,

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:01.268
so it's not presentable
in its current state.

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:03.911
But the one I sang was good, more or less.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:06.863
So: What was it about?

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:09.690
What was the meaning behind those lines?

00:06:09.714 --> 00:06:13.237
I had just returned from doing
a concert in Israel,

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:17.890
and I was very emotional over a problem
that hits really close to home,

00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:19.981
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.128
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:25.025
and my mom's family
are non-practicing Christians.

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:29.608
I was raised in a home
where the two traditions lived together

00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:31.344
more or less in harmony.

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:36.575
It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa
dressed as Santa Claus, for example,

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.837
or to see my non-Jewish grandpa
at the synagogue wearing his kippah,

00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.276
at family celebrations, wearing the same
expression that I probably had

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.663
when Sabina told me --

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:45.727
(Laughter)

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.813
that he had some Décima lines for me.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:53.797
For someone raised
in that kind of environment,

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:59.032
it's especially painful to see
the difficulty the opposing parties have

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:02.243
in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:03.817
So that's what I wrote about.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:05.653
I already had the lyrics,

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:08.126
I had the form -- the Décima --
and the content.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:10.986
I needed to write the music.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.570
I'll give you some context.

00:07:13.594 --> 00:07:17.413
I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
where I'm from, to Spain.

00:07:18.293 --> 00:07:21.115
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:23.919
like many of you here,
who are away from home.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.540
And I wanted my song
to be very, very Uruguayan,

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.353
the most Uruguayan type of song
there is -- the milonga.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.453
So now, I had been studying the Décima,
and after finding out

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:40.383
that everyone tried to claim
the Décima as their own,

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:42.275
that it was invented in their country,

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:43.453
it made me wonder:

00:07:43.477 --> 00:07:46.092
What does it mean when we say
the milonga is Uruguayan?

00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:51.733
The milonga has a rhythmic pattern
that we musicians call 3-3-2.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.619
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:02.419
And it has a characteristic emphasis.

00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:05.315
(Sings)

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:13.655
But this characteristic rhythm pattern

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:15.110
comes from Africa.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.690
In the ninth century you could find it
in the brothels of Persia,

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:19.873
and in the thirteenth,

00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:23.993
in Spain, from where,
five centuries later,

00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:26.668
it would cross over to America
with the African slaves.

00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:32.254
Meanwhile, in the Balkans,
it encounters the Roma scale --

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.137
(Sings)

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:42.327
which in part, gives birth
to klezmer music,

00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:47.202
which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants
bring to Brooklyn, New York.

00:08:47.848 --> 00:08:49.660
They sing it in their banquet halls.

00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:56.332
(Sings "Hava Nagila")

00:08:57.485 --> 00:09:00.411
And their neighbor,
an Argentine kid of Italian origin

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:02.701
named Astor Piazzolla,

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:04.743
hears it,

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:06.294
assimilates it

00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:09.319
and transforms the tango
of the second half of the 20th century

00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:10.496
with his ...

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.623
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:16.948
(Sings "Adios Nonino")

00:09:22.114 --> 00:09:26.805
He also played it on his bandoneon,
a 19th-century German instrument

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:30.956
created for churches
that couldn't afford to buy organs,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.347
and that ends up, incredibly,
in Río de la Plata,

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:37.458
forming the very essence
of the tango and the milonga,

00:09:37.482 --> 00:09:41.448
in the very same way another instrument
just as important as the bandoneon did:

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:44.076
the Spanish guitar.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.212
(Applause)

00:09:56.457 --> 00:09:59.281
To which, by the way,
Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:00.557
added a sixth string.

00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:03.451
It's amazing how all these things
are coming full circle.

00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:06.355
What have I learned in these 15 years
since the song was born

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:09.715
from going all over the world
with four lines written on a coaster

00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:10.889
from a bar in Madrid?

00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:13.844
That Décimas,

00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:15.931
the milonga,

00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:17.521
songs, people --

00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:20.414
the closer you get to them,

00:10:20.438 --> 00:10:22.938
the more complex their identity becomes,

00:10:23.605 --> 00:10:25.660
and the more nuances and details appear.

00:10:26.818 --> 00:10:29.967
I learned that identity
is infinitely dense,

00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:32.543
like an infinite series of real numbers,

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:34.315
and that even if you get very close

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:35.497
and zoom in,

00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:36.672
it never ends.

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:43.040
Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,

00:10:43.064 --> 00:10:45.338
allow me to tell you one last story.

00:10:45.362 --> 00:10:49.962
Not long ago, we were in Mexico
after a concert.

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:53.163
And since the concert promoters know me,

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:57.111
they knew I was a Décima freak
and that everywhere I go I ask about it,

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:58.873
insisting on hearing Décima artists.

00:10:58.897 --> 00:11:03.587
So they organized a son jarocho show
for me at their house.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:08.711
If you recall, the son jarocho
is one of the styles of music

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.827
that uses Décimas in its verses.

00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:16.364
When these amazing musicians
finished playing

00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:19.266
what is for me, something amazing,
which is the son jarocho,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.955
they finished playing and were ...

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:23.198
I went up to greet them, really excited,

00:11:23.222 --> 00:11:27.466
getting ready to thank them
for their gift of music,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.719
and this young kid says to me --

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:34.313
and he says it with the best
of intentions -- he says,

00:11:34.337 --> 00:11:41.301
"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping
alive the purest origins

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.583
of our Mexican identity."

00:11:44.418 --> 00:11:47.334
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't really know what to say.

00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:48.387
(Laughter)

00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:51.576
I stood there looking at him.
I gave him a hug and left, but ...

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.866
(Laughter)

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.875
But he was right, too, though. Right?

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:57.730
In reality, the Décima is its origin,
but at the same time,

00:11:57.754 --> 00:12:00.124
just like in the milonga
and in the Décima,

00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:04.095
are the roots of many more cultures
from all over the place, like he said.

00:12:06.013 --> 00:12:09.690
Later, when I got back to the hotel,
I thought about it for a while.

00:12:09.714 --> 00:12:10.880
And I thought:

00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:13.808
things only look pure

00:12:15.093 --> 00:12:17.268
if you look at them from far away.

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.386
It's very important
to know about our roots,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.432
to know where we come from,
to understand our history.

00:12:25.456 --> 00:12:28.454
But at the same time, as important
as knowing where we're from,

00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:32.054
is understanding that deep down,

00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:34.038
we're not completely from one place,

00:12:34.062 --> 00:12:35.687
and a little from everywhere.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:36.936
Thank you very much.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.088
(Applause)

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.421
This is "The milonga of the Jewish Moor."

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:53.462
(Music)

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.637
(Sings)

00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.848
For every wall a lament
in Jerusalem the golden

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:18.063
and 1000 wasted lives
for every commandment.

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:25.246
I am dust in your wind
and although I bleed through your wound,

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:32.713
and every beloved stone
has my deepest affection,

00:13:33.748 --> 00:13:40.044
there is not a stone in the world
worth more than a human life.

00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:49.427
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:56.698
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:04.482
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:13.190
There is not one death that does not
cause me pain, there are no winners

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:21.042
there's nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:28.310
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:35.394
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:43.428
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth.

00:14:45.126 --> 00:14:51.961
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:14:52.342 --> 00:14:59.082
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:06.687
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:13.858 --> 00:15:18.859
And nobody has my permission
for killing in my name,

00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:27.302
a man is but a man
and if there is a God, this was his wish,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:34.474
the very ground I tread
will live on, once I am gone

00:15:35.912 --> 00:15:41.641
on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines
will suffer the same fate,

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:47.123
and there is not one nation
that has not proclaimed itself

00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.118
the chosen people.

00:15:51.807 --> 00:15:58.782
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:05.767
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:07.052 --> 00:16:12.879
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:12.903 --> 00:16:19.303
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:16:20.084 --> 00:16:21.484
(Applause)

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:22.674
Thank you.

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:27.011
(Applause)
