00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.336
A few days after my husband Paul
was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.856
we were lying in our bed at home,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.656
and Paul said,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.880
"It's going to be OK."

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.536
And I remember answering back,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.776
"Yes.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.560
We just don't know what OK means yet."

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.816
Paul and I had met as first-year
medical students at Yale.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.280
He was smart and kind and super funny.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.696
He used to keep a gorilla suit
in the trunk of his car,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.136
and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.360
(Laughter)

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.920
I fell in love with Paul as I watched
the care he took with his patients.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.576
He stayed late talking with them,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.056
seeking to understand
the experience of illness

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.200
and not just its technicalities.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.776
He later told me he fell in love with me

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
when he saw me cry over an EKG
of a heart that had ceased beating.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.656
We didn't know it yet,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.816
but even in the heady days of young love,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.960
we were learning how
to approach suffering together.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.216
We got married and became doctors.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.256
I was working as an internist

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.336
and Paul was finishing his training
as a neurosurgeon

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000
when he started to lose weight.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.400
He developed excruciating back pain
and a cough that wouldn't go away.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.536
And when he was admitted to the hospital,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
a CT scan revealed tumors
in Paul's lungs and in his bones.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.240
We had both cared for patients
with devastating diagnoses;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560
now it was our turn.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.320
We lived with Paul's illness
for 22 months.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.440
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.480
I gave birth to our daughter Cady,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.920
and we loved her and each other.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.360
We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.895
The day we took Paul
into the hospital for the last time

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.960
was the most difficult day of my life.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.536
When he turned to me at the end

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.040
and said, "I'm ready,"

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.680
I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.600
It was the right one.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.560
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.856
In that moment,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480
the most important thing to Paul

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.240
was to hold our baby daughter.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.056
Nine hours later,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.280
Paul died.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.216
I've always thought of myself
as a caregiver --

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.296
most physicians do --

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.120
and taking care of Paul
deepened what that meant.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.736
Watching him reshape
his identity during his illness,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.256
learning to witness and accept his pain,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.816
talking together through his choices --

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.256
those experiences taught me

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.536
that resilience does not mean
bouncing back to where you were before,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.240
or pretending that
the hard stuff isn't hard.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120
It is so hard.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.440
It's painful, messy stuff.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.736
But it's the stuff.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
And I learned that when we
approach it together,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.800
we get to decide what success looks like.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.400
One of the first things
Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.880
"I want you to get remarried."

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.816
And I was like, whoa, I guess
we get to say anything out loud.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.376
(Laughter)

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.456
It was so shocking

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.280
and heartbreaking ...

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.656
and generous,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.176
and really comforting

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.776
because it was so starkly honest,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.920
and that honesty turned out
to be exactly what we needed.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.456
Early in Paul's illness,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.840
we agreed we would
just keep saying things out loud.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.696
Tasks like making a will,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.376
or completing our advance directives --

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.976
tasks that I had always avoided --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.280
were not as daunting as they once seemed.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.399
I realized that completing
an advance directive is an act of love --

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.040
like a wedding vow.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.976
A pact to take care of someone,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.296
codifying the promise

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.240
that til death do us part,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.480
I will be there.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.400
If needed, I will speak for you.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.480
I will honor your wishes.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.640
That paperwork became
a tangible part of our love story.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.256
As physicians,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.936
Paul and I were in a good position

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.120
to understand and even
accept his diagnosis.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.456
We weren't angry about it,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.696
luckily,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.856
because we'd seen so many patients
in devastating situations,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.560
and we knew that death is a part of life.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.456
But it's one thing to know that;

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.136
it was a very different experience

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.640
to actually live with the sadness
and uncertainty of a serious illness.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.936
Huge strides are being made
against lung cancer,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.720
but we knew that Paul likely had
months to a few years left to live.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.936
During that time,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.760
Paul wrote about his transition
from doctor to patient.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.736
He talked about feeling
like he was suddenly at a crossroads,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.560
and how he would have thought
he'd be able to see the path,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.056
that because he treated so many patients,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.360
maybe he could follow in their footsteps.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.080
But he was totally disoriented.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.216
Rather than a path,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.736
Paul wrote,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.816
"I saw instead

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.000
only a harsh, vacant,
gleaming white desert.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.880
As if a sandstorm
had erased all familiarity.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.000
I had to face my mortality

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.600
and try to understand
what made my life worth living,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.160
and I needed my oncologist's
help to do so."

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.496
The clinicians taking care of Paul

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.736
gave me an even deeper appreciation
for my colleagues in health care.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.736
We have a tough job.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.536
We're responsible for helping patients
have clarity around their prognoses

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.536
and their treatment options,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.056
and that's never easy,
but it's especially tough

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.760
when you're dealing with potentially
terminal illnesses like cancer.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.016
Some people don't want to know
how long they have left,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.240
others do.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.320
Either way, we never have those answers.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.040
Sometimes we substitute hope

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.440
by emphasizing the best-case scenario.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.416
In a survey of physicians,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.256
55 percent said
they painted a rosier picture

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.736
than their honest opinion

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.720
when describing a patient's prognosis.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.680
It's an instinct born out of kindness.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.536
But researchers have found

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.776
that when people better understand
the possible outcomes of an illness,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.320
they have less anxiety,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.840
greater ability to plan

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.160
and less trauma for their families.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.536
Families can struggle
with those conversations,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.040
but for us, we also found that information
immensely helpful with big decisions.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.120
Most notably,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.240
whether to have a baby.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.760
Months to a few years meant
Paul was not likely to see her grow up.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.336
But he had a good chance
of being there for her birth

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.000
and for the beginning of her life.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.616
I remember asking Paul

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.016
if he thought having
to say goodbye to a child

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.560
would make dying even more painful.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.256
And his answer astounded me.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.976
He said,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.240
"Wouldn't it be great if it did?"

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.240
And we did it.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.400
Not in order to spite cancer,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.376
but because we were learning

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.560
that living fully
means accepting suffering.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.296
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.616
so he could continue
working as a neurosurgeon,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.080
which initially we thought
was totally impossible.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.816
When the cancer advanced

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.360
and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.536
his palliative care doctor
prescribed a stimulant medication

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.160
so he could be more focused.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.280
They asked Paul about
his priorities and his worries.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.720
They asked him what trade-offs
he was willing to make.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.616
Those conversations
are the best way to ensure

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.520
that your health care matches your values.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.936
Paul joked that it's not
like that "birds and bees" talk

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.296
you have with your parents,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.856
where you all get it over with
as quickly as possible,

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.576
and then pretend it never happened.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.496
You revisit the conversation
as things change.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.440
You keep saying things out loud.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.656
I'm forever grateful

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.056
because Paul's clinicians felt

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.176
that their job wasn't to try
to give us answers they didn't have,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.576
or only to try to fix things for us,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.400
but to counsel Paul
through painful choices ...

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.320
when his body was failing
but his will to live wasn't.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.000
Later, after Paul died,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.656
I received a dozen bouquets of flowers,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.200
but I sent just one ...

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.136
to Paul's oncologist,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.616
because she supported his goals

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.200
and she helped him weigh his choices.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.200
She knew that living
means more than just staying alive.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.616
A few weeks ago,
a patient came into my clinic.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.800
A woman dealing
with a serious chronic disease.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.776
And while we were talking
about her life and her health care,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.280
she said, "I love my palliative care team.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.200
They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.440
Yeah, I thought, of course it is.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.080
But many patients don't feel that.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.976
Compassion and Choices did a study

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.200
where they asked people
about their health care preferences.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.816
And a lot of people
started their answers with the words

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.280
"Well, if I had a choice ..."

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.600
If I had a choice.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.776
And when I read that "if,"

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.976
I understood better

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.856
why one in four people

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.736
receives excessive or unwanted
medical treatment,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.920
or watches a family member receive
excessive or unwanted medical treatment.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.696
It's not because doctors don't get it.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.920
We do.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.456
We understand the real
psychological consequences

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.840
on patients and their families.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.600
The things is, we deal with them, too.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.056
Half of critical care nurses
and a quarter of ICU doctors

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.616
have considered quitting their jobs

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.536
because of distress over feeling
that for some of their patients,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.960
they've provided care
that didn't fit with the person's values.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.896
But doctors can't make sure
your wishes are respected

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.120
until they know what they are.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.720
Would you want to be on life support
if it offered any chance of longer life?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.616
Are you most worried
about the quality of that time,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.840
rather than quantity?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.000
Both of those choices
are thoughtful and brave,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.040
but for all of us, it's our choice.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.920
That's true at the end of life

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.496
and for medical care throughout our lives.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.376
If you're pregnant,
do you want genetic screening?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.320
Is a knee replacement right or not?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.920
Do you want to do dialysis
in a clinic or at home?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.800
The answer is:

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.840
it depends.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.040
What medical care will help you
live the way you want to?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.296
I hope you remember that question

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.480
the next time you face
a decision in your health care.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.240
Remember that you always have a choice,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.960
and it is OK to say no to a treatment
that's not right for you.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.976
There's a poem by W.S. Merwin --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.296
it's just two sentences long --

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.440
that captures how I feel now.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.096
"Your absence has gone through me

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.640
like thread through a needle.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.280
Everything I do
is stitched with its color."

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.760
For me that poem evokes my love for Paul,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.496
and a new fortitude

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.560
that came from loving and losing him.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.760
When Paul said, "It's going to be OK,"

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.680
that didn't mean
that we could cure his illness.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.120
Instead, we learned to accept
both joy and sadness at the same time;

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.536
to uncover beauty and purpose

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.720
both despite and because we are all born

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.720
and we all die.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.080
And for all the sadness
and sleepless nights,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.320
it turns out there is joy.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.056
I leave flowers on Paul's grave

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.800
and watch our two-year-old
run around on the grass.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.840
I build bonfires on the beach
and watch the sunset with our friends.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.280
Exercise and mindfulness
meditation have helped a lot.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.096
And someday,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.680
I hope I do get remarried.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.320
Most importantly,
I get to watch our daughter grow.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.616
I've thought a lot
about what I'm going to say to her

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.880
when she's older.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.600
"Cady,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.976
engaging in the full
range of experience --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.696
living and dying,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.200
love and loss --

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.320
is what we get to do.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.120
Being human doesn't happen
despite suffering.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.960
It happens within it.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.680
When we approach suffering together,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.680
when we choose not to hide from it,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.496
our lives don't diminish,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.720
they expand."

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.600
I've learned that cancer
isn't always a battle.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.056
Or if it is,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.080
maybe it's a fight for something
different than we thought.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.000
Our job isn't to fight fate,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.880
but to help each other through.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.800
Not as soldiers

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.200
but as shepherds.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.976
That's how we make it OK,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.480
even when it's not.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.440
By saying it out loud,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.360
by helping each other through ...

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.240
and a gorilla suit never hurts, either.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.496
Thank you.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.616
(Applause)
