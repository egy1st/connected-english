00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.456
Chris Anderson: So Robert
spent the last few years

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.816
think about how weird human behavior is,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.056
and how inadequate most
of our language trying to explain it is.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.456
And it's very exciting to hear him
explain some of the thinking behind it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.136
in public for the first time.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.256
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240
(Applause)

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.656
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.160
The fantasy always runs
something like this.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.136
I've overpowered his elite guard,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.095
burst into his secret bunker

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.936
with my machine gun ready.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.856
He lunges for his Luger.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.696
I knock it out of his hand.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.056
He lunges for his cyanide pill.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.816
I knock that out of his hand.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.136
He snarls,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.376
comes at me with otherworldly strength.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.096
We grapple, we fight,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.016
I manage to pin him down

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.600
and put on handcuffs.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.496
"Adolf Hitler," I say,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360
"I arrest you for crimes
against humanity."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.976
Here's where the Medal of Honor
version of the fantasy ends

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.856
and the imagery darkens.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.599
What would I do if I had Hitler?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.920
It's not hard to imagine
once I allow myself.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.856
Sever his spine at the neck.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.256
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.056
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.216
Leave him alive on a respirator,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.536
tube-fed, not able to speak
or move or see or hear, just to feel,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.816
and then inject him
with something cancerous

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.096
that's going to fester and pustulate

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.056
until every cell in his body
is screaming in agony,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.320
until every second
feels like an eternity in hell.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.520
That's what I would do to Hitler.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.936
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.456
still do sometimes,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.136
and when I do, my heart speeds up --

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.040
all these plans for the most evil,
wicked soul in history.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.096
But there's a problem,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.016
which is I don't actually believe
in souls or evil,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.576
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.016
But there's some people
I would like to see killed,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.856
but I'm against the death penalty.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.976
But I like schlocky violent movies,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.776
but I'm for strict gun control.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.856
But then there was a time
I was at a laser tag place,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.760
and I had such a good time
hiding in a corner shooting at people.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.160
In other words, I'm your basic
confused human when it comes to violence.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.096
Now, as a species, we obviously
have problems with violence.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.176
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.296
letters with anthrax,
airplanes as weapons,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.176
mass rape as a military strategy.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.480
We're a miserably violent species.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.416
But there's a complication,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.816
which is we don't hate violence,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.696
we hate the wrong kind.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.176
And when it's the right kind,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.696
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.856
we vote for, we mate with
our champions of it.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.696
When it's the right kind of violence,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.920
we love it.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.176
And there's another complication,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.256
which is, in addition to us
being this miserably violent species,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.080
we're also this extraordinarily
altruistic, compassionate one.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.816
So how do you make sense
of the biology of our best behaviors,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.856
our worst ones and all of those
ambiguously in between?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.136
Now, for starters,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.456
what's totally boring is understanding
the motoric aspects of the behavior.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.656
Your brain tells your spine,
tells your muscles

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.936
to do something or other,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.896
and hooray, you've behaved.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.576
What's hard is understanding
the meaning of the behavior,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.416
because in some settings,
pulling a trigger is an appalling act;

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.416
in others, it's heroically
self-sacrificial.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.376
In some settings, putting your hand
one someone else's

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.856
is deeply compassionate.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.776
In others, it's a deep betrayal.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.336
The challenge is to understand

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.616
the biology of the context
of our behaviors,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.240
and that's real tough.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.216
One thing that's clear, though,
is you're not going to get anywhere

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.656
if you think there's going to be
the brain region or the hormone

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.416
or the gene or the childhood experience

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520
or the evolutionary mechanism
that explains everything.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.160
Instead, every bit of behavior
has multiple levels of causality.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.200
Let's look at an example.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.040
You have a gun.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.296
There's a crisis going on:

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.896
rioting, violence, people running around.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.096
A stranger is running at you
in an agitated state --

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.216
you can't quite tell if the expression
is frightened, threatening, angry --

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.456
holding something
that kind of looks like a handgun.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.696
You're not sure.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.616
The stranger comes running at you

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.376
and you pull the trigger.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.336
And it turns out
that thing in this person's hand

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.560
was a cell phone.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.416
So we asked this biological question:

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.616
what was going on
that caused this behavior?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.536
What caused this behavior?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.856
And this is a multitude of questions.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.096
We start.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.536
What was going on in your brain
one second before you pulled that trigger?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.256
And this brings us into the realm
of a brain region called the amygdala.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.216
The amygdala, which is
central to violence, central to fear,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.936
initiates volleys of cascades

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.216
that produce pulling of a trigger.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.920
What was the level of activity
in your amygdala one second before?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.256
But to understand that,
we have to step back a little bit.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.856
What was going on in the environment
seconds to minutes before

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.616
that impacted the amygdala?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.736
Now, obviously, the sights,
the sounds of the rioting,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.976
that was pertinent.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.216
But in addition,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.696
you're more likely to mistake
a cell phone for a handgun

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.976
if that stranger was male

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.600
and large and of a different race.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.496
Furthermore, if you're in pain,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.696
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.256
your frontal cortex
is not going to work as well,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.936
part of the brain whose job it is
to get to the amygdala in time

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.240
saying, "Are you really sure
that's a gun there?"

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.936
But we need to step further back.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.136
Now we have to look
at hours to days before,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.136
and with this, we have entered
the realm of hormones.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.296
For example, testosterone,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.056
where regardless of your sex,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.936
if you have elevated
testosterone levels in your blood,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.336
you're more likely to think
a face with a neutral expression

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.416
is instead looking threatening.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.296
Elevated testosterone levels,
elevated levels of stress hormones,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.616
and your amygdala
is going to be more active

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.120
and your frontal cortex
will be more sluggish.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.056
Pushing back further,
weeks to months before,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.536
where's the relevance there?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.096
This is the realm of neural plasticity,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.056
the fact that your brain
can change in response to experience,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.256
and if your previous months
have been filled with stress and trauma,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.136
your amygdala will have enlarged.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.376
The neurons will have become
more excitable,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.736
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.560
all relevant to what happens
in that one second.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.976
But we push back even more, back years,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.496
back, for example, to your adolescence.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.016
Now, the central fact
of the adolescent brain

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.776
is all of it is going full blast

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.496
except the frontal cortex,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.256
which is still half-baked.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.456
It doesn't fully mature
until you're around 25.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.696
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.856
are the years where environment
and experience sculpt your frontal cortex

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.680
into the version you're going to have
as an adult in that critical moment.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.576
But pushing back even further,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.056
even further back
to childhood and fetal life

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.896
and all the different versions
that that could come in.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.176
Now, obviously, that's the time
that your brain is being constructed,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.416
and that's important,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.736
but in addition,
experience during those times

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.736
produce what are called
epigenetic changes,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.416
permanent, in some cases,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.776
permanently activating
certain genes, turning off others.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.296
And as an example of this,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.336
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot
of stress hormones through your mother,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.776
epigenetics is going to produce
your amygdala in adulthood

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.736
as a more excitable form,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.400
and you're going to have
elevated stress hormone levels.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.856
But pushing even further back,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.576
back to when you were just a fetus,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.416
back to when all you were
was a collection of genes.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.816
Now, genes are really
important to all of this,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.576
but critically, genes don't
determine anything,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.240
because genes work differently
in different environments.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.896
Key example here:

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.056
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.736
and if you have that variant,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.416
you are far more likely
to commit antisocial violence

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.416
if, and only if,
you were abused as a child.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.816
Genes and environment interact,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.456
and what's happening in that one second
before you pull that trigger

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.720
reflects your lifetime
of those gene-environment interactions.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.296
Now, remarkably enough,
we've got to push even further back now,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.696
back centuries.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.056
What were your ancestors up to.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.256
And if, for example,
they were nomadic pastoralists,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.536
they were pastoralists,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.136
people living in deserts or grasslands

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.816
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.896
odds are they would have invented
what's called a culture of honor

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.136
filled with warrior classes,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.856
retributive violence, clan vendettas,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.136
and amazingly, centuries later,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.840
that would still be influencing
the values with which you were raised.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.936
But we've got to push even further back,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.696
back millions of years,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.776
because if we're talking about genes,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.456
implicitly we're now talking
about the evolution of genes.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.696
And what you see is, for example,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.216
patterns across different primate species.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.656
Some of them have evolved
for extremely low levels of aggression,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.216
others have evolved
in the opposite direction,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.136
and floating there in between
by every measure are humans,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.056
once again this confused,
barely defined species

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.320
that has all these potentials
to go one way or the other.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.376
So what has this gotten us to?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.376
Basically, what we're seeing here is,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.296
if you want to understand a behavior,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.176
whether it's an appalling one,
a wondrous one,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.936
or confusedly in between,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.496
if you want to understand that,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.976
you've got take into account
what happened a second before

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.456
to a million years before,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.136
everything in between.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.136
So what can we conclude at this point?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.456
Officially, it's complicated.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.096
Wow, that's really helpful.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.376
It's complicated,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.976
and you'd better be
real careful, real cautious

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.336
before you conclude
you know what causes a behavior,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.120
especially if it's a behavior
you're judging harshly.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.576
Now, to me, the single most important
point about all of this

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.976
is one having to do with change.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.376
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here
can change in different circumstances.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.216
For example, ecosystems change.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.656
Thousands of years ago,
the Sahara was a lush grassland.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.296
Cultures change.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.656
In the 17th century, the most terrifying
people in Europe were the Swedes,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.416
rampaging all over the place.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.616
This is what the Swedish
military does now.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.480
They haven't had a war in 200 years.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.736
Most importantly,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.376
brains change.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.416
Neurons grow new processes.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.896
Circuits disconnect.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.576
Everything in the brain changes,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.800
and out of this come extraordinary
examples of human change.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.016
First one:

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.736
this is a man named John Newton,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.096
a British theologian

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.856
who played a central role in the abolition
of slavery from the British Empire

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.896
in the early 1800s.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.656
And amazingly, this man
spent decades as a younger man

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.816
as the captain of a slave ship,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.776
and then as an investor in slavery,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.936
growing rich from this.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.616
And then something changed.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.176
Something changed in him,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.456
something that Newton himself celebrated
in the thing that he's most famous for,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.096
a hymn that he wrote:

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.520
"Amazing Grace."

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.936
This is a man named Zenji Abe
on the morning of December 6, 1941,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.936
about to lead a squadron of Japanese
bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.496
And this is the same man
50 years later to the day

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.096
hugging a man who survived
the attack on the ground.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.536
And as an old man,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.976
Zenji Abe came to a collection
of Pearl Harbor survivors

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.416
at a ceremony there

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.760
and in halting English apologized
for what he had done as a young man.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.656
Now, it doesn't always require decades.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.376
Sometimes, extraordinary change
could happen in just hours.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.776
Consider the World War I
Christmas truce of 1914.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.936
The powers that be
had negotiated a brief truce

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.576
so that soldiers could go out,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.496
collect bodies from no-man's-land
in between the trench lines.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.456
And soon British and German soldiers

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.936
were doing that,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.416
and then helping each other carry bodies,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.096
and then helping each other
dig graves in the frozen ground,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.376
and then praying together,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.216
and then having Christmas together
and exchanging gifts,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.456
and by the next day,
they were playing soccer together

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.856
and exchanging addresses
so they could meet after the war.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.856
That truce kept going
until the officers had to arrive

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.376
and said, "We will shoot you

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.896
unless you go back
to trying to kill each other."

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.056
And all it took here was hours

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.416
for these men to develop
a completely new category of "us,"

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.336
all of us in the trenches here

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.136
on both sides, dying for no damn reason,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.816
and who is a "them,"
those faceless powers behind the lines

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.440
who were using them as pawns.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.880
And sometimes,
change can occur in seconds.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.056
Probably the most horrifying event
in the Vietnam War

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.976
was the My Lai Massacre.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.016
A brigade of American soldiers

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.056
went into an undefended
village full of civilians

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.616
and killed between 350 and 500 of them,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.496
mass-raped women and children,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.096
mutilated bodies.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.336
It was appalling.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.616
It was appalling because it occurred,
because the government denied it,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.016
because the US government eventually
did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.296
and appalling because it almost certainly
was not a singular event.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.416
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man
who stopped the My Lai Massacre.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.056
He was piloting a helicopter gunship,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.896
landed there, got out

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.976
and saw American soldiers shooting babies,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.376
shooting old women,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.296
figured out what was going on,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.416
and he then took his helicopter

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.416
and did something that undid
his lifetime of conditioning

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.496
as to who is an "us" and who is a "them."

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.376
He landed his helicopter

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.016
in between some surviving villagers
and American soldiers

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.696
and he trained his machine guns
on his fellow Americans,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.600
and said, "If you don't stop the killing,
I will mow you down."

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.536
Now, these people
are no more special than any of us.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.136
Same neurons, same neurochemicals,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.480
same biology.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.776
What we're left with here
is this inevitable cliche:

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.536
"Those who don't study history
are destined to repeat it."

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.736
What we have here is the opposite of it.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.016
Those who don't study the history
of extraordinary human change,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.576
those who don't study the biology
of what can transform us

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.096
from our worst to our best behaviors,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.176
those who don't do this
are destined not to be able

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.080
to repeat these incandescent,
magnificent moments.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.680
So thank you.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.120
(Applause)

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.536
CA: Talks that really give you
a new mental model about something,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.496
those are some of my favorite TED Talks,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.240
and we just got one.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.816
Robert, thank you so much for that.
Good luck with the book.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.096
That was amazing,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.296
and we're going to try and get you
to come here in person one year.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.536
Thank you so much.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.040
RS: Thank you. Thank you all.
