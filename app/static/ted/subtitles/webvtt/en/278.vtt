00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was this very implausible technology

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that technically could have worked,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This was a perfect introduction.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it's a story that did work. It did happen,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the machines are all around us.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And it was a technology that was inevitable.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If the people I'm going to tell you the story about,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's the universe in which these machines

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
are now doing all these things, including changing biology.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And three of the smartest people were

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
he was working on something much more important than bombs:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
he's thinking about computers.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
He built this machine,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The first person to really explain that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you can do it all with arithmetic.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He said you needed addition and subtraction.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
showed that you didn't even need subtraction.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You could do the whole thing with addition.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that drove the computer revolution.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
He talked about doing it with marbles,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
having gates and what we now call shift registers,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And that's what all these machines are doing,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
except, instead of doing it with marbles,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
they're doing it with electrons.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to actually try and build such a machine.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which also goes back to Turing,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with a very brainless, little, finite state machine,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but capable of only two ideas.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And that's really the simplest computer.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's basically why you need the qubit,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because it only has two ideas.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And you put lots of those together,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
you get the essentials of the modern computer:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the recording medium, the input and the output.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we saw it in starting these programs up.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The instructions which govern this operation

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you look at the origins of this,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Such a computer would open up universes,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The guy who was supposed to build this machine

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of all time, decided not to go into computers.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
televisions are the future, not computers.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The essentials were all there --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
all the things that make these machines run.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
where Freeman works at the Institute.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
That's where I grew up as a kid.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
so we both go back to the birth of this thing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
That's Freeman, a long time ago,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and that was me.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
who wrote the "Theory of Games."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
All these forces came together there, in Princeton.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And Julian Bigelow, who took

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They didn't fit in at the Institute.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This is a letter from the director, concerned about --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You can read the text.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
(Laughter).

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
These were not theoretical physicists.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
at 15 other places around the world.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
All the computers now are copies of that machine.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The memory was in cathode ray tubes --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So, there's 40 of these tubes,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
like a V-40 engine running the memory.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
(Laughter)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
This is modifying IBM equipment,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
reliable machines out of unreliable components.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This includes a large amount of human error.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
What's code, what's hardware?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
let alone having, you know, software problems.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
"No use, went home." (Laughter)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So, already, they're complaining about the manuals:

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"before closing down in disgust ... "

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
"The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Burning lots of midnight oil.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
"Found trouble in code, I hope."

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
"Code error, machine not guilty."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Laughter)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
"Something's wrong with the air conditioner --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
smell of burning V-belts in the air."

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
"A short -- do not turn the machine on."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So they really were working under tough conditions.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
(Laughter)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Laughter)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There's an inside joke someone has penciled in:

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
"Here lies Marston Mouse."

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
If you're a mathematician, you get that,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because Marston was a mathematician who

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
objected to the computer being there.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That's two thousand cycles per second --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that's slow speed.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
"I have now duplicated both results.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This now is the third different output.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I know when I'm licked."

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
"We've duplicated errors before."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
"Only happens when the machine is running."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And sometimes things are okay.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
late one night, finally drew a bomb.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So, that was the result. It was Mike,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That was designed on that machine,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in the woods behind the Institute.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
from all over the world to work on all these problems.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
trying to see if, in this artificial universe --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And he saw everything in terms of --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
he could read the binary code straight off the machine.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
He had a wonderful rapport.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Even errors were duplicated.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So he designed this universe, and ran it.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He would run that thing all night long, running these things,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
who reinvented this stuff.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It was published in the literature.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So, he decided to give it a try,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to start this artificial biology going in the machines.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And he found all these, sort of --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
it was like a naturalist coming in

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and seeing all these things happening

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that we see in the outside world, in biology.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This is some of the generations of his universe.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But they're just going to stay numbers;

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
they're not going to become organisms.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They have to have something.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
playing chess with other machines and so on.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And they did start to evolve.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And he went around the country after that.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and saw exactly what's happening now.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you'd keep running

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
he envisioned all that happening.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that would have some intelligence.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And he went out of his way to say

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that he was not saying this was lifelike,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
or a new kind of life.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It just was another version of the same thing happening.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and what nature did billions of years ago.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And could you do it again now?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the archivist came up one day, saying,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And it was his universe on punch cards.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
That's the instructions for running --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
this is actually the source code

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
for one of those universes,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
with a note from the engineers

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
saying they're having some problems.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
What's the dividing line between

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And the question is, should we run them or not?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You know, could we get them running?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
These machines would think they --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
these organisms, if they came back to life now --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
My laptop is 10 thousand million times

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
He was thinking far ahead, to

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
how this would really grow into a new kind of life.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And that's what's happening!

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
When Juan Enriquez told us about

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
that's what Barricelli imagined:

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that this digital code in these machines

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
is actually starting to code --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
it already is coding from nucleic acids.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and synthesizing small strings of DNA.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
on self-reproducing machines,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to where they begin to reproduce.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It took really three people:

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that now, last count, four million

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
this is John Markoff's obituary for him --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
he was the important missing link,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the engineer who came in

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And all our computers have, inside them,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
the copies of the architecture that he had to just design

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
one day, sort of on pencil and paper.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And he explained, in a very generous way,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the spirit that brought all these different people to

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
That's the last entry in the logbook

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
when the machine was shut down, July 1958.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
when the machine was officially turned off.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And that's the end.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
(Applause)
