WEBVTT

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:04.851
Namaskar.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.290
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:11.844
and I don't use Botox as yet.

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:13.084
(Laughter)

00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:17.308
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
like a 21-year-old in my movies.

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:19.684
Yeah, I do that.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:24.604
I sell dreams, and I peddle love
to millions of people back home in India

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:26.884
who assume that I'm
the best lover in the world.

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:29.108
(Laughter)

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:32.724
If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,

00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:34.684
but I never let that assumption go away.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:35.724
(Laughter)

00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:37.364
I've also been made to understand

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:39.844
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:41.324
and I feel really sad for you.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:43.764
(Laughter)

00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:46.468
(Applause)

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:52.164
That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:53.444
as a movie star should be.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:54.524
(Laughter)

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:58.164
That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here

00:00:58.188 --> 00:00:59.754
to speak about the future "you."

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.714
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:05.058
(Laughter)

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:10.044
Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.284
(Laughter)

00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:12.684
It is. It is.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:14.228
It's an aging movie star,

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:18.004
grappling with all
the newness around itself,

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.684
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.724
and still trying to find a way

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.828
to keep on shining regardless.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:29.068
I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.

00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:32.444
And my father was a freedom fighter.

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:35.498
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:40.564
And much like the original homo sapiens,

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:42.228
we struggled to survive.

00:01:42.908 --> 00:01:45.044
When I was in my early 20s,

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:46.804
I lost both my parents,

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.164
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:51.484
but --

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.508
(Laughter)

00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:58.924
I do remember the night my father died,

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:03.844
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:06.684
He mumbled something
about "dead people don't tip so well"

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.148
and walked away into the dark.

00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:10.884
And I was only 14 then,

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:14.364
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:15.604
and my mother besides me,

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:18.204
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:21.844
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:23.668
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:29.284
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,

00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:30.604
"Just now, Mom."

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:32.884
(Laughter)

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:34.444
So from that night onwards,

00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:37.164
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,

00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:40.508
I learned the crude tools of survival.

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:44.804
And the framework of life was
very, very simple then, to be honest.

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.804
You know, you just ate what you got

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:49.644
and did whatever you were told to do.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:53.004
I thought celiac was a vegetable,

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:57.564
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
lost comrade in "Star Trek."

00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:58.684
(Laughter)

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.684
You married the first girl that you dated,

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.548
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.

00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:10.588
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:15.084
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:16.364
(Laughter)

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:17.588
Where was I?

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.044
We relied on systems

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.764
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:28.244
to protect us,

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:31.924
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.

00:03:31.948 --> 00:03:33.884
Science was simple and logical,

00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:36.228
Apple was still then just a fruit

00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:39.244
owned by Eve first and then Newton,

00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:41.604
not by Steve Jobs, until then.

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:43.324
And "Eureka!" was what you screamed

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.548
when you wanted
to run naked on the streets.

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:49.844
You went wherever life took you for work,

00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:51.948
and people were mostly welcoming of you.

00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.564
Migration was a term then

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:57.148
still reserved for Siberian cranes,
not human beings.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.844
Most importantly, you were who you were

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.708
and you said what you thought.

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:04.644
Then in my late 20s,

00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:08.404
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:09.764
and my framework,

00:04:09.788 --> 00:04:13.084
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.308
began to alter.

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:17.548
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.404
things started to look a little different.

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:23.228
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.364
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:29.508
Definitions became more and more fluid.

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:32.628
Work began to define you at that time

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:36.044
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,

00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:38.924
and all the systems
started to feel less reliable to me,

00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:42.084
almost too thick to hold on

00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:44.084
to the diversity of mankind

00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:46.148
and the human need to progress and grow.

00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:50.428
Ideas were flowing
with more freedom and speed.

00:04:51.388 --> 00:04:56.724
And I experienced the miracle
of human innovation and cooperation,

00:04:56.748 --> 00:04:58.164
and my own creativity,

00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:02.684
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.548
catapulted me into superstardom.

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:07.564
I started to feel that I had arrived,

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:11.084
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.

00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:12.364
I was all over the place.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:14.404
You know? I'd done 50 films by then

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:16.028
and 200 songs,

00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:19.044
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.364
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.724
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.

00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:26.804
(Laughter)

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:30.244
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.604
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie --

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:36.364
(Laughter)

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:37.884
for two and a half seconds.

00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:39.204
(Laughter)

00:05:39.228 --> 00:05:41.924
And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.

00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:43.164
OK, maybe not.

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:46.724
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table

00:05:46.748 --> 00:05:48.788
with her back towards me most of the time.

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:51.828
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:56.004
and humanity was soaring with me.

00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:58.708
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.988
And then you all know what happened.

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:02.748
The internet happened.

00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:05.684
I was in my late 40s,

00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:08.348
and I started tweeting
like a canary in a birdcage

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.244
and assuming that, you know,
people who peered into my world

00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:13.524
would admire it

00:06:13.548 --> 00:06:15.644
for the miracle I believed it to be.

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:17.868
But something else
awaited me and humanity.

00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:23.644
You know, we had expected
an expansion of ideas and dreams

00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:26.268
with the enhanced
connectivity of the world.

00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:33.508
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.724
of judgment, of definition

00:06:36.748 --> 00:06:38.884
that flowed from the same place

00:06:38.908 --> 00:06:41.148
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.

00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.270
Everything I said took a new meaning.

00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:46.868
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --

00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:51.164
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:53.788
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also

00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:55.788
met with the same fate.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.908
Four years ago,

00:06:58.948 --> 00:07:02.908
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.

00:07:03.988 --> 00:07:05.668
It was claimed on the net

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:08.884
that he was the love child

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:10.108
of our first child

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:11.988
who was 15 years old.

00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:15.884
Apparently, he had sown
his wild oats with a girl

00:07:15.908 --> 00:07:18.108
while driving her car in Romania.

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:21.188
And yeah, there was
a fake video to go with it.

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:23.444
And we were so disturbed as a family.

00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:24.724
My son, who is 19 now,

00:07:24.748 --> 00:07:26.564
even now when you say "hello" to him,

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:28.044
he just turns around and says,

00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.764
"But bro, I didn't even have
a European driving license."

00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:33.244
(Laughter)

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:34.548
Yeah.

00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:36.724
In this new world,

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:40.124
slowly, reality became virtual
and virtual became real,

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:41.804
and I started to feel

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:45.364
that I could not be who I wanted to be
or say what I actually thought,

00:07:45.388 --> 00:07:47.188
and humanity at this time

00:07:48.308 --> 00:07:50.244
completely identified with me.

00:07:50.268 --> 00:07:53.268
I think both of us
were going through our midlife crisis,

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:58.404
and humanity, like me,
was becoming an overexposed prima donna.

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:00.124
I started to sell everything,

00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:03.044
from hair oil to diesel generators.

00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:05.084
Humanity was buying everything

00:08:05.108 --> 00:08:07.484
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:11.484
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit

00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:13.548
to reinvent myself.

00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:16.228
I must admit I failed miserably.

00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:22.044
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.164
and Supermen of the world,

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:26.044
you have to commend them,

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:28.844
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.

00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:29.924
(Laughter)

00:08:29.948 --> 00:08:32.428
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:35.164
Really.

00:08:35.188 --> 00:08:38.724
And accidentally, I happened
to even invent a new dance form

00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:40.883
which I didn't realize,
and it became a rage.

00:08:40.907 --> 00:08:42.123
So if it's all right,

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:45.324
and you've seen a bit of me,
so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.

00:08:45.348 --> 00:08:46.804
It was called the Lungi dance.

00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:49.924
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.

00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:51.164
(Cheers)

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:53.268
So it went something like this.

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:56.284
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

00:08:56.308 --> 00:08:58.724
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.404
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi.

00:09:01.428 --> 00:09:03.084
That's it. It became a rage.

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.404
(Cheers)

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:05.628
It really did.

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:11.604
Like you notice, nobody could make
any sense of what was happening except me,

00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:13.244
and I didn't give a damn, really,

00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:15.484
because the whole world,
and whole humanity,

00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:17.428
seemed as confused and lost as I was.

00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:19.804
I didn't give up then.

00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:22.604
I even tried to reconstruct
my identity on the social media

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:23.884
like everyone else does.

00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:26.644
I thought if I put on
philosophical tweets out there

00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:28.244
people will think I'm with it,

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:30.844
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets

00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:34.204
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?

00:09:34.228 --> 00:09:36.284
ROFL, LOL.

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:40.604
"Adidas," somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.964
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,

00:09:42.988 --> 00:09:45.884
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.764
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.748
"Adidas" now means
"All day I dream about sex."

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.564
(Laughter)

00:09:54.588 --> 00:09:55.884
Really.

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:57.404
I didn't know if you know that.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:02.004
So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:06.468
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:08.388
WTF.

00:10:10.188 --> 00:10:11.508
But here we are.

00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:14.084
I am 51 years old, like I told you,

00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:17.684
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.004
I just want to tell you

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:22.244
if there has been a momentous time
for humanity to exist,

00:10:22.268 --> 00:10:23.884
it is now,

00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:26.148
because the present you is brave.

00:10:27.308 --> 00:10:28.644
The present you is hopeful.

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:31.964
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:35.228
and of course, the present you
is annoyingly indefinable.

00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:37.948
And in this spell-binding,

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.724
imperfect moment of existence,

00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:43.324
feeling a little brave
just before I came here,

00:10:43.348 --> 00:10:46.348
I decided to take
a good, hard look at my face.

00:10:47.668 --> 00:10:51.324
And I realized that I'm beginning
to look more and more

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:53.764
like the wax statue of me
at Madame Tussaud's.

00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:56.044
(Laughter)

00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:58.564
Yeah, and in that moment of realization,

00:10:58.588 --> 00:11:02.828
I asked the most central
and pertinent question to humanity and me:

00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:06.148
Do I need to fix my face?

00:11:07.388 --> 00:11:10.724
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,

00:11:10.748 --> 00:11:14.124
a modern expression of human creativity.

00:11:14.148 --> 00:11:15.684
The land I come from

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:20.668
is the source of inexplicable
but very simple spirituality.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:23.548
In its immense generosity,

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.124
India decided somehow

00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:31.124
that I, the Muslim son
of a broke freedom fighter

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:34.988
who accidentally ventured
into the business of selling dreams,

00:11:35.908 --> 00:11:39.828
should become its king of romance,

00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:43.188
the "Badhshah of Bollywood,"

00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:46.628
the greatest lover
the country has ever seen ...

00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:48.708
with this face.

00:11:49.228 --> 00:11:50.444
Yeah.

00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:51.564
(Laughter)

00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:54.484
Which has alternately
been described as ugly, unconventional,

00:11:54.508 --> 00:11:56.324
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:59.228
(Laughter)

00:12:01.668 --> 00:12:04.004
The people of this ancient land

00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:06.444
embraced me in their limitless love,

00:12:06.468 --> 00:12:08.148
and I've learned from these people

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.388
that neither power nor poverty

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:13.924
can make your life more magical

00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:15.228
or less tortuous.

00:12:15.948 --> 00:12:18.564
I've learned from the people of my country

00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:20.684
that the dignity of a life,

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.308
a human being, a culture,
a religion, a country

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.228
actually resides in its ability

00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:29.828
for grace and compassion.

00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:32.588
I've learned that whatever moves you,

00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:35.964
whatever urges you to create, to build,

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.644
whatever keeps you from failing,

00:12:37.668 --> 00:12:39.924
whatever helps you survive,

00:12:39.948 --> 00:12:44.324
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,

00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.228
and that is love.

00:12:47.508 --> 00:12:50.404
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,

00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:51.594
(Recites poem in Hindi)

00:13:01.108 --> 00:13:02.764
(Poem ends)

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:05.364
Which loosely translates
into that whatever --

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.464
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.

00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:08.924
(Applause)

00:13:08.948 --> 00:13:10.472
It's very difficult to remember.

00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:14.004
Which loosely translates
into actually saying

00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:16.484
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:19.404
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge

00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:22.764
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:25.924
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future

00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:32.068
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:36.284
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "प्रेम,"

00:13:36.308 --> 00:13:37.724
which means "love,"

00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:39.644
if you are able to understand that

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:41.244
and practice it,

00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:44.468
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.

00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:47.188
So I truly believe the future "you"

00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:49.828
has to be a you that loves.

00:13:50.628 --> 00:13:52.668
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.

00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:56.988
It will perish in its own self-absorption.

00:13:58.508 --> 00:13:59.948
So you may use your power

00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:02.364
to build walls

00:14:02.388 --> 00:14:03.828
and keep people outside,

00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:08.948
or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.

00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:11.804
You may use your faith

00:14:11.828 --> 00:14:13.268
to make people afraid

00:14:14.348 --> 00:14:16.108
and terrify them into submission,

00:14:17.228 --> 00:14:19.684
or you can use it
to give courage to people

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:23.444
so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.

00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:25.404
You can use your energy

00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:28.764
to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,

00:14:28.788 --> 00:14:32.548
or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.

00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:37.564
You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:40.004
You can destroy the ecology,

00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:42.204
or turn to them with love

00:14:42.228 --> 00:14:44.468
and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.244
You may land on Mars

00:14:47.268 --> 00:14:49.028
and build armed citadels,

00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:55.588
or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.

00:14:56.428 --> 00:15:00.164
And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned

00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:01.748
to wage futile wars

00:15:03.108 --> 00:15:06.004
and give guns in the hands
of little children

00:15:06.028 --> 00:15:07.388
to kill each other with,

00:15:08.468 --> 00:15:09.668
or you can use it

00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:12.164
to make more food

00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:13.588
to fill their stomachs with.

00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:16.324
My country has taught me

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:20.708
the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.

00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:26.204
It shines forth in a world

00:15:26.228 --> 00:15:31.308
which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.

00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:35.404
In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people

00:15:35.428 --> 00:15:37.164
coming and showing their talent,

00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:40.524
talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.884
the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here

00:15:43.908 --> 00:15:46.684
in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you

00:15:46.708 --> 00:15:49.724
are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future "us."

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.228
But within that celebration

00:15:52.388 --> 00:15:55.948
the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion

00:15:57.388 --> 00:16:00.428
has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:02.988
just as equally.

00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:06.188
So I believe the future "you"

00:16:07.028 --> 00:16:08.308
is an infinite you.

00:16:09.228 --> 00:16:11.788
It's called a chakra
in India, like a circle.

00:16:12.828 --> 00:16:15.668
It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.

00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:20.764
A you that perceives
time and space differently

00:16:20.788 --> 00:16:22.108
understands both

00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:28.188
your unimaginable

00:16:29.508 --> 00:16:31.924
and fantastic importance

00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:37.548
and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.

00:16:38.668 --> 00:16:40.148
A you that returns back

00:16:40.948 --> 00:16:42.804
to the original innocence of humanity,

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:44.908
which loves from the purity of heart,

00:16:45.748 --> 00:16:48.068
which sees from the eyes of truth,

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:54.908
which dreams from the clarity
of an untampered mind.

00:16:56.268 --> 00:16:57.588
The future "you" has to be

00:16:58.548 --> 00:17:00.108
like an aging movie star

00:17:01.068 --> 00:17:04.004
who has been made to believe
that there is a possibility

00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:06.803
of a world which is completely,

00:17:06.828 --> 00:17:09.844
wholly, self-obsessively

00:17:09.868 --> 00:17:11.068
in love with itself.

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:15.244
A world -- really, it has to be a you

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:17.204
to create a world

00:17:17.227 --> 00:17:19.028
which is its own best lover.

00:17:20.028 --> 00:17:21.844
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:21.868 --> 00:17:23.404
should be the future "you."

00:17:23.427 --> 00:17:24.884
Thank you very much.

00:17:24.908 --> 00:17:26.124
Shukriya.

00:17:26.148 --> 00:17:28.283
(Applause)

00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:29.523
Thank you.

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:32.484
(Applause)

00:17:32.508 --> 00:17:33.764
Thank you.

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:36.388
(Applause)
