00:00:01.627 --> 00:00:05.960
Do you ever think about how important
the oceans are in our daily lives?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.576
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.591
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.690
They moderate our climate.

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:19.832
And they provide jobs
and medicine and food

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:25.125
including 20 percent of protein
to feed the entire world population.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.847
People used to think
that the oceans were so vast

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:31.332
that they wouldn't be affected
by human activities.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.491
Well today I'm going to tell you
about a serious reality

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:40.148
that is changing our oceans
called ocean acidification,

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.728
or the evil twin of climate change.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.322
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed
25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:51.590
that we have emitted to the atmosphere?

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.608
Now this is just another great service
provided by the oceans

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.502
since carbon dioxide
is one of the greenhouse gases

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.283
that's causing climate change.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.346
But as we keep pumping
more and more and more

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:07.864
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.483
more is dissolving into the oceans.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.723
And this is what's changing
our ocean chemistry.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.738
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:20.001
it undergoes a number
of chemical reactions.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.585
Now lucky for you,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.895
I don't have time to get into
the details of the chemistry for today.

00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:28.712
But I'll tell you as more
carbon dioxide enters the ocean,

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.094
the seawater pH goes down.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.697
And this basically means that there
is an increase in ocean acidity.

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:40.470
And this whole process
is called ocean acidification.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:43.630
And it's happening
alongside climate change.

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:48.459
Scientists have been monitoring
ocean acidification for over two decades.

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:51.671
This figure is an important
time series in Hawaii,

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:56.591
and the top line shows steadily increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide,

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.131
or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:02.488
And this is directly as a result
of human activities.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.371
The line underneath shows the increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:10.332
that is dissolved
in the surface of the ocean

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:13.537
which you can see is increasing
at the same rate

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.736
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
since measurements began.

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.934
The line on the bottom shows
then shows the change in chemistry.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.785
As more carbon dioxide
has entered the ocean,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.056
the seawater pH has gone down,

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.598
which basically means there has been
an increase in ocean acidity.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:35.255
Now in Ireland, scientists are also
monitoring ocean acidification --

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.073
scientists at the Marine
Institute and NUI Galway.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:42.373
And we, too, are seeing
acidification at the same rate

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:45.405
as these main ocean time-series
sites around the world.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.739
So it's happening right at our doorstep.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.728
Now I'd like to give you an example
of just how we collect our data

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:55.006
to monitor a changing ocean.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.244
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples
in the middle of winter.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.408
So as you can imagine,
in the North Atlantic

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.038
we get hit with some seriously
stormy conditions --

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.782
so not for any of you
who get a little motion sickness,

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.235
but we are collecting
some very valuable data.

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:11.471
So we lower this instrument
over the side of the ship,

00:03:11.496 --> 00:03:13.932
and there are sensors
that are mounted on the bottom

00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:16.630
that can tell us information about
the surrounding water,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.075
such as temperature
or dissolved oxygen.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.265
And then we can collect our seawater
samples in these large bottles.

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.684
So we start at the bottom,
which can be over four kilometers deep

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.566
just off our continental shelf,

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:32.478
and we take samples at regular intervals
right up to the surface.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:35.136
We take the seawater back on the deck,

00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:37.650
and then we can either
analyze them on the ship

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.810
or back in the laboratory
for the different chemicals parameters.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.453
But why should we care?

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:47.095
How is ocean acidification
going to affect all of us?

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:51.666
Well, here are the worrying facts.

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:58.579
There has already been an increase
in ocean acidity of 26 percent

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:02.611
since pre-industrial times,
which is directly due to human activities.

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:07.738
Unless we can start slowing down
our carbon dioxide emissions,

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:13.968
we're expecting an increase
in ocean acidity of 170 percent

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:16.737
by the end of this century.

00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:20.046
I mean this is within
our children's lifetime.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:27.123
This rate of acidification
is 10 times faster

00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:33.569
than any acidification in our oceans
for over 55 million years.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.431
So our marine life have never,
ever experienced

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:41.225
such a fast rate of change before.

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:45.450
So we literally could not know
how they're going to cope.

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:51.621
Now there was a natural acidification
event millions of years ago,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.519
which was much slower
than what we're seeing today.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.621
And this coincided with a mass extinction
of many marine species.

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:02.478
So is that what we're headed for?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.420
Well, maybe.

00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:08.523
Studies are showing
some species are actually doing quite well

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:11.538
but many are showing a negative response.

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:17.133
One of the big concerns is
as ocean acidity increases,

00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:21.681
the concentration of carbonate
ions in seawater decrease.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.401
Now these ions are basically
the building blocks

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:28.227
for many marine species
to make their shells,

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.314
for example crabs or mussels, oysters.

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:35.734
Another example are corals.

00:05:35.932 --> 00:05:39.113
They also need these carbonate
ions in seawater

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:43.043
to make their coral structure
in order to build coral reefs.

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:46.557
As ocean acidity increases

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.009
and the concentration
of carbonate ions decrease,

00:05:50.462 --> 00:05:54.922
these species first find it more difficult
to make their shells.

00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.040
And at even even lower levels,
they can actually begin to dissolve.

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:03.278
This here is a pteropod,
it's called a sea butterfly.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:06.690
And it's an important food source
in the ocean for many species,

00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:10.475
from krill to salmon right up to whales.

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:14.902
The shell of the pteropod
was placed into seawater

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:18.347
at a pH that we're expecting
by the end of this century.

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:24.696
After only 45 days
at this very realistic pH,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.182
you can see the shell
has almost completely dissolved.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.689
So ocean acidification could affect
right up through the food chain --

00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:35.935
and right onto our dinner plates.

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:40.116
I mean who here
likes shellfish? Or salmon?

00:06:40.682 --> 00:06:42.310
Or many other fish species

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:45.178
whose food source
in the ocean could be affected?

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:47.973
These are cold-water corals.

00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:51.645
And did you know we actually have
cold-water corals in Irish waters,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.517
just off our continental shelf?

00:06:54.023 --> 00:06:58.142
And they support rich biodiversity,
including some very important fisheries.

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:01.943
It's projected that
by the end of this century,

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:08.190
70 percent of all known cold-water corals
in the entire ocean

00:07:08.577 --> 00:07:13.271
will be surrounded by seawater
that is dissolving their coral structure.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.508
The last example I have
are these healthy tropical corals.

00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:25.820
They were placed in seawater at a pH
we're expecting by the year 2100.

00:07:27.484 --> 00:07:32.998
After six months, the coral
has almost completely dissolved.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.535
Now coral reefs support

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:43.133
25 percent of all marine life
in the entire ocean.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.020
All marine life.

00:07:46.068 --> 00:07:50.393
So you can see: ocean
acidification is a global threat.

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:53.160
I have an eight-month-old baby boy.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.837
Unless we start now to slow this down,

00:07:58.003 --> 00:08:02.368
I dread to think what our oceans
will look like when he's a grown man.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.668
We will see acidification.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.070
We have already put too much
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.712
But we can slow this down.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:18.472
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.934
The only way of doing that

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:24.317
is by reducing our
carbon dioxide emissions.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.416
This is important for both you and I,
for industry, for governments.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.371
We need to work together,
slow down global warming

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.881
slow down ocean acidification

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.813
and help to maintain a healthy ocean
and a healthy planet

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.130
for our generation
and for generations to come.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.827
(Applause)
