00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.576
It's six o'clock in the morning,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.920
pitch black outside.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.856
My 14-year-old son
is fast asleep in his bed,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.960
sleeping the reckless,
deep sleep of a teenager.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.976
I flip on the light and physically
shake the poor boy awake,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.616
because I know that,
like ripping off a Band-Aid,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.576
it's better to get it over with quickly.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.256
(Laughter)

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.016
I have a friend who yells "Fire!"
just to rouse her sleeping teen.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.016
And another who got so fed up

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.896
that she had to dump cold water
on her son's head

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.840
just to get him out of bed.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.336
Sound brutal ...

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.160
but perhaps familiar?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.456
Every morning I ask myself,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.056
"How can I --

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.816
knowing what I know

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.256
and doing what I do for a living --

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.280
be doing this to my own son?"

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.336
You see,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.056
I'm a sleep researcher.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.256
(Laughter)

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.096
So I know far too much about sleep

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.816
and the consequences of sleep loss.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.936
I know that I'm depriving my son
of the sleep he desperately needs

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.840
as a rapidly growing teenager.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.616
I also know that by waking him up

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.296
hours before his natural
biological clock tells him he's ready,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.720
I'm literally robbing him
of his dreams --

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.176
the type of sleep most associated
with learning, memory consolidation

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.040
and emotional processing.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.640
But it's not just my kid
that's being deprived of sleep.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.520
Sleep deprivation among
American teenagers is an epidemic.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.856
Only about one in 10 gets
the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080
recommended by sleep scientists
and pediatricians.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.016
Now, if you're thinking to yourself,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.296
"Phew, we're doing good,
my kid's getting eight hours,"

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.536
remember,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.056
eight hours is
the minimum recommendation.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.136
You're barely passing.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.000
Eight hours is kind of like
getting a C on your report card.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.800
There are many factors
contributing to this epidemic,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.136
but a major factor preventing teens
from getting the sleep they need

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.479
is actually a matter of public policy.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.040
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.776
Across the country,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.656
many schools are starting
around 7:30am or earlier,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.776
despite the fact that major
medical organizations recommend

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.240
that middle and high school
start no earlier than 8:30am.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.376
These early start policies
have a direct effect on how much --

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.400
or really how little sleep
American teenagers are getting.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.416
They're also pitting
teenagers and their parents

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.520
in a fundamentally unwinnable fight
against their own bodies.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.176
Around the time of puberty,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.936
teenagers experience a delay
in their biological clock,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.640
which determines when we feel most awake
and when we feel most sleepy.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.160
This is driven in part by a shift
in the release of the hormone melatonin.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.616
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing
melatonin until around 11pm,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.960
which is two hours later than what
we see in adults or younger children.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.856
This means that waking a teenager up
at 6am is the biological equivalent

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.840
of waking an adult up at 4am.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.736
On the unfortunate days
when I have to wake up at 4am,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.096
I'm a zombie.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.856
Functionally useless.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.496
I can't think straight,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.016
I'm irritable,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.480
and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.800
But this is how many American
teenagers feel every single school day.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.296
In fact, many of the, shall we say,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.656
unpleasant characteristics
that we chalk up to being a teenager --

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.096
moodiness, irritability,
laziness, depression --

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.000
could be a product
of chronic sleep deprivation.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.816
For many teens
battling chronic sleep loss,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.336
their go-to strategy to compensate
is consuming large quantities of caffeine

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.536
in the form of venti frappuccinos,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.400
or energy drinks and shots.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.296
So essentially,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.320
we've got an entire population
of tired but wired youth.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.216
Advocates of sleep-friendly
start times know

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.776
that adolescence is a period
of dramatic brain development,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.856
particularly in the parts of the brain

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.416
that are responsible for those
higher order thinking processes,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.720
including reasoning, problem-solving
and good judgment.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.456
In other words, the very type
of brain activity that's responsible

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.056
for reining in those impulsive
and often risky behaviors

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.016
that are so characteristic of adolescence

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.800
and that are so terrifying
to us parents of teenagers.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.496
They know that like the rest of us,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.936
when teenagers don't
get the sleep they need,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.096
their brains, their bodies
and behaviors suffer

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.760
with both immediate and lasting effects.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.096
They can't concentrate,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.016
their attention plummets

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.800
and many will even show
behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.736
But the consequences of teen sleep loss
go well beyond the classroom,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.376
sadly contributing to many
of the mental health problems

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.096
that skyrocket during adolescence,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.936
including substance use,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.440
depression and suicide.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.576
In our work with teens
from LA Unified School District,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.816
we found that teens with sleep problems

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.040
were 55 percent more likely
to have used alcohol in the past month.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.976
In another study with over
30,000 high school students,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.576
they found that
for each hour of lost sleep,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.320
there was a 38 percent increase
in feeling sad or hopeless,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.280
and a 58 percent increase
in teen suicide attempts.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.856
And if that's not enough,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.416
teens who skip out on sleep
are at increased risk

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.496
for a host of physical health problems
that plague our country,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.600
including obesity,
heart disease and diabetes.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.656
Then there's the risk
of putting a sleep-deprived teen,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.216
with a newly minted driver's license,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.520
behind the wheel.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.656
Studies have shown that getting five hours
or less of sleep per night

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.360
is the equivalent of driving with a blood
alcohol content above the legal limit.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.696
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.776
and researchers in this area,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.976
have produced tremendous science

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.896
showing the tremendous benefits
of later start times.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.216
The findings are unequivocal,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.936
and as a sleep scientist,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.680
I rarely get to speak
with that kind of certainty.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.976
Teens from districts
with later start times get more sleep.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.496
To the naysayers who may think
that if schools start later,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.160
teens will just stay up later,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.176
the truth is,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.136
their bedtimes stay the same,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.416
but their wake-up times get extended,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.600
resulting in more sleep.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.736
They're more likely to show up for school;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.656
school absences dropped
by 25 percent in one district.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.256
And they're less likely to drop out.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.776
Not surprisingly,
they do better academically.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.536
So this has real implications
for reducing the achievement gap.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.256
Standardized test scores
in math and reading

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.720
go up by two to three percentage points.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.896
That's as powerful as reducing class sizes
by one-third fewer students,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.096
or replacing a so-so teacher
in the classroom

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.280
with a truly outstanding one.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.976
Their mental and physical health improves,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.336
and even their families are happier.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.176
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little
more pleasantness from our teens,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.160
and a little less crankiness?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.896
Even their communities are safer

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.456
because car crash rates go down --

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.320
a 70 percent reduction in one district.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.816
Given these tremendous benefits,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.176
you might think,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.896
well, this is a no-brainer, right?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.200
So why have we as a society
failed to heed this call?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.240
Often the argument against later
start times goes something like this:

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.296
"Why should we delay
start times for teenagers?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.560
We need to toughen them up
so they're ready for the real world!"

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.096
But that's like saying
to the parent of a two-year-old,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.616
"Don't let Johnny nap,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.056
or he won't be ready for kindergarten."

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.280
(Laughter)

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.776
Delaying start times also presents
many logistical challenges.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.176
Not just for students and their families,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.576
but for communities as a whole.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.176
Updating bus routes,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.256
increased transportation costs,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.816
impact on sports,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.256
care before or after school.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.856
These are the same concerns
that come up in district after district,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.856
time and again around the country

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.960
as school start times are debated.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.640
And they're legitimate concerns,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.520
but these are problems
we have to work through.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.376
They are not valid excuses

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.160
for failing to do the right thing
for our children,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.800
which is to start middle and high schools
no earlier than 8:30am.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.656
And in districts around the country,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.296
big and small,
who have made this change,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.096
they found that these fears
are often unfounded

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.536
and far outweighed by the tremendous
benefits for student health

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.216
and performance,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.200
and our collective public safety.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.936
So tomorrow morning,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.680
when coincidentally we get
to set our clocks back by an hour

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.080
and you get that delicious
extra hour of sleep,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.240
and the day seems a little longer,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.720
and a little more full of hope,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.680
think about the tremendous power of sleep.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.096
And think about what a gift it would be

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.136
for our children to be able
to wake up naturally,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.400
in harmony with their own biology.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.656
Thank you,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.880
and pleasant dreams.
