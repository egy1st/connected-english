WEBVTT

00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:03.842
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.732
who is under the mistaken impression

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:09.319
that this conference
is named in honor of her father.

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:10.642
(Laughter)

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.802
Who am I to contradict my baby girl?

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.545
As many of you know, there's something
about becoming a parent

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:22.029
that concentrates the mind
on long-term problems like climate change.

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:25.049
It was the birth of my daughter
that inspired me

00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:27.627
to launch this climate organization,

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:31.522
in order to counteract the excessive
polarization of this issue

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:32.855
in the United States,

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.332
and to find a conservative
pathway forward.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.783
Yes, folks, a Republican
climate solution is possible,

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:44.132
and you know what?

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.488
It may even be better.

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.123
(Laughter)

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.808
Let me try to prove that to you.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.843
What we really need
is a killer app to climate policy.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:00.284
In the technology world, a killer app
is an application so transformative

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:01.787
that it creates its own market,

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.376
like Uber.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.027
In the climate world,

00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:09.976
a killer app is a new
solution so promising

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.547
that it can break through
the seemingly insurmountable

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.432
barriers to progress.

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.981
These include the psychological barrier.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.218
Climate advocates have long
been encouraging their fellow citizens

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:24.152
to make short-term sacrifices now

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:26.213
for benefits that accrue to other people

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:29.581
in other countries 30 or 40
years in the future.

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:33.908
It just doesn't fly because it runs
contrary to basic human nature.

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:38.000
Next is the geopolitical barrier.

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:40.292
Under the current rules of global trade,

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:44.662
countries have a strong incentive
to free ride off the emissions reductions

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:45.945
of other nations,

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.201
instead of strengthening
their own programs.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.783
This has been the curse

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:53.770
of every international
climate negotiations, including Paris.

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:57.478
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.

00:01:57.502 --> 00:01:59.573
Even the most committed countries --

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:02.797
Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:07.542
are nowhere near reducing emissions
at the required scale and speed.

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.034
Not even close.

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:13.308
And the partisan climate divide
is far more acute

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.205
here in the United States.

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:17.909
We are fundamentally stuck,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:21.493
and that is why we need
a killer app of climate policy

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:24.258
to break through each of these barriers.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.418
I'm convinced that the road
to climate progress in the United States

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.057
runs through the Republican Party

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.165
and the business community.

00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:39.008
So in launching
the Climate Leadership Council,

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:42.946
I started by reaching out to a who's who
of Republican elder statesmen

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.160
and business leaders,

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.561
including James Baker and George Schultz,

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.705
the two most respected Republican
elder statesmen in America;

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:53.598
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:57.264
the two most respected
conservative economists in the country;

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.381
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:02.374
two of the most successful
and admired business leaders.

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:04.699
Together, we co-authored

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:07.787
"The Conservative Case
For Carbon Dividends."

00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.346
This represents the first time

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.961
that Republican leaders put forth

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.498
a concrete market-based climate solution.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:17.903
(Applause)

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:18.996
Thank you.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.623
(Applause)

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.974
We presented our plan at the White House

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:26.700
two weeks after President Trump moved in.

00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:31.523
Almost every leading
editorial board in the country

00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:33.794
has since endorsed our plan,

00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:38.503
and Fortune 100 companies
from a wide range of industries

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:40.878
are now getting behind it.

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:42.863
So by now you're probably wondering,

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:45.289
what exactly is this plan?

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:49.681
Well, our carbon dividends solution
is based on four pillars.

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:53.615
The first is a gradually
rising carbon tax.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.166
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.365
like many operating systems,
it's prone to bugs,

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.582
which, in this case, are called
"market failures."

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:06.128
By far the largest is that
market prices fail to take

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:09.891
social and environmental
costs into account.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:15.255
That means every market transaction
is based on incorrect information.

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.377
This fundamental bug of capitalism,
more than any other single factor,

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:22.157
is to blame for our climate predicament.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.071
Now in theory, this should be
an easy problem to fix.

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:27.461
Economists agree

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:32.273
that the best solution is to put a price
on the carbon content of fossil fuels,

00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:34.571
otherwise known as a carbon tax.

00:04:34.595 --> 00:04:38.323
This would discourage carbon emissions

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:40.667
in every single economic transaction,

00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:42.401
every day of the year.

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:47.771
However, a carbon tax by itself
has proven to be unpopular

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.463
and a political dead end.

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:53.518
The answer is to return
all the money raised

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:55.834
directly to citizens,

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:59.209
in the form of equal monthly dividends.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:03.211
This would transform
an unpopular carbon tax

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:06.477
into a popular and populist solution,

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:08.325
and it would also solve

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.662
the underlying psychological barrier
that we discussed,

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:16.363
by giving everyone a concrete benefit
in the here and now.

00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:19.596
And these benefits would be significant.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.362
Assuming a carbon tax rate
that starts at 40 dollars per ton,

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:26.809
a family of four would receive
2,000 dollars per year

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.064
from the get-go.

00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:30.886
According to the US Treasury Department,

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.669
the bottom 70 percent of Americans
would receive more in dividends

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:39.984
than they would pay
in increased energy prices.

00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:47.001
That means 223 million Americans
would win economically

00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:49.035
from solving climate change.

00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.973
And that --

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.052
(Applause)

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.626
is revolutionary,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.381
and could fundamentally
alter climate politics.

00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:01.595
But there's another
revolutionary element here.

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.099
The amount of the dividend would grow

00:06:05.123 --> 00:06:07.484
as the carbon tax rate increases.

00:06:07.508 --> 00:06:09.584
The more we protect our climate,

00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:11.463
the more our citizens benefit.

00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:13.709
This creates a positive feedback loop,

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:15.263
which is crucial,

00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:19.183
because the only way we will reach
our long-term emission-reduction goals

00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:21.963
is if the carbon tax rate
goes up every year.

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.945
The third pillar of our program
is eliminating regulations

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.508
that are no longer needed

00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:31.610
once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.

00:06:31.634 --> 00:06:38.063
This is a key selling point
to Republicans and business leaders.

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.624
So why should we trade

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.697
climate regulations for a price on carbon?

00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:45.499
Well, let me show you.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:50.604
Our plan would achieve nearly twice
the emissions reductions

00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:54.784
of all Obama-era climate
regulations combined,

00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:58.418
and nearly three times the new baseline

00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:02.599
after President Trump repeals
all of those regulations.

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:06.386
That assumes a carbon tax
starting at 40 dollars per ton,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.403
which translates into roughly
an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.

00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:14.571
Our plan by itself

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:18.168
would meet the high end
of America's commitment

00:07:18.192 --> 00:07:20.470
under the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:22.168
and as you can see,

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.178
the emissions reductions
would continue over time.

00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:31.269
This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution

00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:34.181
based on free markets
and limited government.

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.384
We would end up with less regulation

00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:40.500
and far less pollution at the same time,

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:44.508
while helping working-class
Americans get ahead.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.770
Doesn't that sound like something
we could all support?

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:50.227
(Applause)

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:58.422
The fourth and final pillar of our program
is a new climate domino effect,

00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.100
based on border carbon adjustments.

00:08:01.124 --> 00:08:03.227
Now that may sound complicated,

00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:05.116
but it, too, is revolutionary,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.001
because it provides us
a whole new strategy

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:10.573
to reach a global price on carbon,

00:08:10.597 --> 00:08:12.464
which is ultimately what we need.

00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:14.420
Let me show you an example.

00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:17.945
Suppose Country A adopts
a carbon dividends plan,

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:19.416
and Country B does not.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.843
Well, to level the playing field

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:25.102
and protect the competitiveness
of its industries,

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:29.024
Country A would tax imports from Country B

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:30.887
based on their carbon content.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:32.428
Fair enough.

00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:34.596
But here's where it gets
really interesting,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.258
because the money raised at the border
would increase the dividends

00:08:38.282 --> 00:08:40.536
going to the citizens of Country A.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.732
Well, how long do you think it would take
the public in Country B to realize

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:46.688
that that money should be going to them,

00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:49.702
and to push for a carbon
dividends plan in their own land?

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.225
Add a few more countries,

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:54.706
and we get a new climate domino effect.

00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:59.806
Once one major country or region
adopts carbon dividends

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.455
with border carbon adjustments,

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.938
other countries are compelled
to follow suit.

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:06.874
One by one the dominoes fall.

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:09.227
And this domino effect
could start anywhere.

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.661
My preference, strongly,
is the United States,

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.212
but it could also start
in the United Kingdom,

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:17.444
in Germany or another European country,

00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:18.996
or even in China.

00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:22.022
Let's take China as an example.

00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:26.590
China is committed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:09:26.614 --> 00:09:28.955
but what its leaders care even more about

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:33.956
is transitioning their economy
to consumer-led economic development.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.856
Well, nothing could do more
to hasten that transition

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.159
than giving every Chinese citizen
a monthly dividend.

00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:43.704
In fact, this is the only policy solution

00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:47.370
that would enable China to meet
its environmental and economic goals

00:09:47.394 --> 00:09:48.752
at the same time.

00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:52.153
That's why this is the killer app
of climate policy,

00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:55.516
because it would enable us to overcome

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.853
each of the barriers we discussed earlier:

00:09:57.877 --> 00:10:00.961
the psychological barrier,
the partisan barrier,

00:10:00.985 --> 00:10:04.445
and, as we've just seen,
the geopolitical barrier.

00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:08.447
All we need is a country to lead the way.

00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:10.900
And one method of finding
what you're looking for

00:10:10.924 --> 00:10:12.584
is to take out an ad.

00:10:12.608 --> 00:10:14.587
So let's read this one together.

00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:18.421
Wanted: country to pioneer
carbon dividends plan.

00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:20.304
Cost to country: zero.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.191
Starting date: as soon as possible.

00:10:23.215 --> 00:10:26.657
Advantages: most effective
climate solution,

00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:28.438
popular and populist,

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.304
pro-growth and pro-business,

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:33.670
shrinks government
and helps the working class.

00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:40.598
Additional compensation: gratitude
of current and future generations,

00:10:41.638 --> 00:10:43.806
including my daughter.

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:45.363
Thank you.

00:10:45.387 --> 00:10:52.387
(Applause)

00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:54.887
Chris Anderson: Just one
question for you, Ted.

00:10:57.401 --> 00:10:58.551
I'm actually not sure

00:10:58.576 --> 00:11:01.453
I've seen a conservative
get a standing O at TED before that.

00:11:01.497 --> 00:11:02.925
That's pretty cool.

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:05.559
The logic seems really powerful,

00:11:05.584 --> 00:11:07.653
but some people you talk to in politics

00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:11.749
say it's hard to imagine this
still getting through Congress.

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.987
How are you feeling
about momentum behind this?

00:11:14.312 --> 00:11:17.936
Ted Halstead: So I understand
that many are very pessimistic

00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.010
about what's happening in
the United States with President Trump.

00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:22.612
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.

00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:25.642
The actions of this White House,
the early actions on climate,

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:31.246
are just the first move
in a complex game of climate chess.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.880
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;

00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:36.754
the pressure is going to mount 
for a replacement program,

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.025
which is where we come in.

00:11:38.049 --> 00:11:41.247
And there are three reasons why,
which I'll go through real quickly.

00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:44.483
One, the business community
is fundamentally parting ways

00:11:44.508 --> 00:11:46.943
with the White House on climate change.

00:11:46.968 --> 00:11:48.118
In fact, we're finding

00:11:48.143 --> 00:11:51.253
a number of Fortune 100 companies
supporting our program.

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.476
Within two months,
we're going to be announcing

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:56.556
some really surprising names
coming out in favor of this program.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.712
Two, there is no issue
in American politics

00:11:59.737 --> 00:12:03.546
where there's a more fundamental gap
between the Republican base

00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:06.206
and the Republican leadership
than climate change.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.960
And three, thinking of
this analogy of chess,

00:12:11.405 --> 00:12:15.634
the big decision up ahead is:
Does the administration stay in Paris?

00:12:15.658 --> 00:12:17.245
Well, let's pan it out both ways.

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:21.015
If it stays in Paris, as many
are pushing for in the administration,

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:23.642
well then that begs a question:
What's the plan?

00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:24.975
We have the plan.

00:12:25.229 --> 00:12:27.299
But if they don't stay in Paris,

00:12:27.324 --> 00:12:29.776
the international pressure
will be overwhelming.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.426
Our Secretary of State will be asking
other countries for NATO contributions,

00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.352
and they'll be saying,
"No, give us our Paris commitment.

00:12:36.377 --> 00:12:39.289
Come through on your commitments,
we'll come through on ours."

00:12:39.313 --> 00:12:42.607
So, international, business
and even the Republican base

00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.396
will all be calling for
a Republican replacement plan.

00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:49.269
And, hopefully, we've provided one.

00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:50.817
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.

00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:51.992
TH: Thank you, Chris.

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:55.579
