00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:04.682
I'd like to start with a simple question:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
Why do the poor make
so many poor decisions?

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:13.403
I know it's a harsh question,

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.392
but take a look at the data.

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:17.259
The poor borrow more, save less,

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.942
smoke more, exercise less, drink more

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.486
and eat less healthfully.

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:23.533
Why?

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.978
Well, the standard explanation

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.382
was once summed up by the British
Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:32.791
And she called poverty
"a personality defect."

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:34.655
(Laughter)

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.585
A lack of character, basically.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:41.456
Now, I'm sure not many of you
would be so blunt.

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:46.347
But the idea that there's something
wrong with the poor themselves

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.354
is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.488
Some of you may believe that the poor
should be held responsible

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:54.265
for their own mistakes.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.186
And others may argue that we should
help them to make better decisions.

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:02.083
But the underlying assumption is the same:

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.224
there's something wrong with them.

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:07.915
If we could just change them,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.431
if we could just teach them
how to live their lives,

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.988
if they would only listen.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.930
And to be honest,

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:18.292
this was what I thought for a long time.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.192
It was only a few years ago
that I discovered

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:24.713
that everything I thought I knew
about poverty was wrong.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.937
It all started when I accidentally
stumbled upon a paper

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.569
by a few American psychologists.

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:33.146
They had traveled 8,000 miles,
all the way to India,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.745
for a fascinating study.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.013
And it was an experiment
with sugarcane farmers.

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:42.186
You should know that these farmers
collect about 60 percent

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.343
of their annual income all at once,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.075
right after the harvest.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.639
This means that they're relatively
poor one part of the year

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:51.257
and rich the other.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:56.651
The researchers asked them to do
an IQ test before and after the harvest.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:01.922
What they subsequently discovered
completely blew my mind.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.608
The farmers scored much worse
on the test before the harvest.

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:10.757
The effects of living
in poverty, it turns out,

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.149
correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.

00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:16.042
Now, to give you an idea,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.507
that's comparable
to losing a night's sleep

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.704
or the effects of alcoholism.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.944
A few months later,
I heard that Eldar Shafir,

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.515
a professor at Princeton University
and one of the authors of this study,

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.858
was coming over to Holland, where I live.

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:32.284
So we met up in Amsterdam

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:35.859
to talk about his revolutionary
new theory of poverty.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.493
And I can sum it up in just two words:

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.432
scarcity mentality.

00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:44.801
It turns out that people
behave differently

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.311
when they perceive a thing to be scarce.

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.550
And what that thing is
doesn't much matter --

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:52.587
whether it's not enough time,
money or food.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.738
You all know this feeling,

00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:56.725
when you've got too much to do,

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.765
or when you've put off breaking for lunch

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.452
and your blood sugar takes a dive.

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:03.304
This narrows your focus
to your immediate lack --

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.338
to the sandwich you've got to have now,

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.624
the meeting that's starting
in five minutes

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:10.527
or the bills that have
to be paid tomorrow.

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:14.264
So the long-term perspective
goes out the window.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:18.366
You could compare it to a new computer

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.577
that's running 10 heavy programs at once.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.974
It gets slower and slower, making errors.

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.820
Eventually, it freezes --

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.950
not because it's a bad computer,

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.594
but because it has too much to do at once.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.327
The poor have the same problem.

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.624
They're not making dumb decisions
because they are dumb,

00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.570
but because they're living in a context

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.938
in which anyone would make dumb decisions.

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:45.490
So suddenly I understood

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:49.480
why so many of our anti-poverty
programs don't work.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:55.171
Investments in education, for example,
are often completely ineffective.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:58.007
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.315
A recent analysis of 201 studies

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.651
on the effectiveness
of money-management training

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:07.424
came to the conclusion
that it has almost no effect at all.

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:08.893
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.413
this is not to say the poor
don't learn anything --

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:13.342
they can come out wiser for sure.

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:15.650
But it's not enough.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.676
Or as Professor Shafir told me,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.684
"It's like teaching someone to swim

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.734
and then throwing them in a stormy sea."

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:26.283
I still remember sitting there,

00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:28.458
perplexed.

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.448
And it struck me

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:32.985
that we could have figured
this all out decades ago.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.260
I mean, these psychologists didn't need
any complicated brain scans;

00:04:36.284 --> 00:04:38.293
they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,

00:04:38.317 --> 00:04:40.825
and IQ tests were invented
more than 100 years ago.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.928
Actually, I realized I had read about
the psychology of poverty before.

00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:49.221
George Orwell, one of the greatest
writers who ever lived,

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:52.148
experienced poverty
firsthand in the 1920s.

00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:55.034
"The essence of poverty,"
he wrote back then,

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.992
is that it "annihilates the future."

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:01.334
And he marveled at, quote,

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:05.212
"How people take it for granted
they have the right to preach at you

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:06.387
and pray over you

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.883
as soon as your income falls
below a certain level."

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:12.812
Now, those words are every bit
as resonant today.

00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:17.126
The big question is, of course:

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.490
What can be done?

00:05:18.514 --> 00:05:21.309
Modern economists have
a few solutions up their sleeves.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.392
We could help the poor
with their paperwork

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:26.398
or send them a text message
to remind them to pay their bills.

00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:31.129
This type of solution is hugely popular
with modern politicians,

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:32.856
mostly because,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.940
well, they cost next to nothing.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.145
These solutions are, I think,
a symbol of this era

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.346
in which we so often treat the symptoms,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.213
but ignore the underlying cause.

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:46.928
So I wonder:

00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:51.133
Why don't we just change the context
in which the poor live?

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.850
Or, going back to our computer analogy:

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:56.011
Why keep tinkering around
with the software

00:05:56.035 --> 00:06:00.100
when we can easily solve the problem
by installing some extra memory instead?

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:03.522
At that point, Professor Shafir
responded with a blank look.

00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:05.929
And after a few seconds, he said,

00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:09.047
"Oh, I get it.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.391
You mean you want to just hand out
more money to the poor

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:15.995
to eradicate poverty.

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.820
Uh, sure, that'd be great.

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:22.215
But I'm afraid that brand
of left-wing politics

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:24.083
you've got in Amsterdam --

00:06:24.107 --> 00:06:25.770
it doesn't exist in the States."

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:30.497
But is this really
an old-fashioned, leftist idea?

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:33.381
I remembered reading about an old plan --

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:36.889
something that has been proposed
by some of history's leading thinkers.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:40.729
The philosopher Thomas More
first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,"

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:42.652
more than 500 years ago.

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:46.755
And its proponents have spanned
the spectrum from the left to the right,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.549
from the civil rights campaigner,
Martin Luther King,

00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:52.324
to the economist Milton Friedman.

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:56.093
And it's an incredibly simple idea:

00:06:57.243 --> 00:06:59.878
basic income guarantee.

00:07:01.465 --> 00:07:02.623
What it is?

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:04.166
Well, that's easy.

00:07:04.727 --> 00:07:07.458
It's a monthly grant, enough to pay
for your basic needs:

00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:09.160
food, shelter, education.

00:07:09.683 --> 00:07:11.504
It's completely unconditional,

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.288
so no one's going to tell you
what you have to do for it,

00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:17.130
and no one's going to tell you
what you have to do with it.

00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:19.444
The basic income
is not a favor, but a right.

00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:21.601
There's absolutely no stigma attached.

00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:25.002
So as I learned about the true
nature of poverty,

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:26.516
I couldn't stop wondering:

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:30.048
Is this the idea
we've all been waiting for?

00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:32.879
Could it really be that simple?

00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:36.148
And in the three years that followed,

00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:38.710
I read everything I could find
about basic income.

00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:40.671
I researched the dozens of experiments

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.816
that have been conducted
all over the globe,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.908
and it didn't take long before I stumbled
upon a story of a town

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.404
that had done it --
had actually eradicated poverty.

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:49.698
But then ...

00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:52.048
nearly everyone forgot about it.

00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:56.115
This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.

00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:02.631
In 1974, everybody in this small town
was guaranteed a basic income,

00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:05.390
ensuring that no one fell
below the poverty line.

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:07.010
At the start of the experiment,

00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:10.507
an army of researchers
descended on the town.

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.898
For four years, all went well.

00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:17.943
But then a new government
was voted into power,

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:21.477
and the new Canadian cabinet saw
little point to the expensive experiment.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.754
So when it became clear there was
no money left to analyze the results,

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:30.580
the researchers decided to pack
their files away in some 2,000 boxes.

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.965
Twenty-five years went by,

00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:37.677
and then Evelyn Forget,
a Canadian professor,

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:38.917
found the records.

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:42.908
For three years, she subjected the data
to all manner of statistical analysis,

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.518
and no matter what she tried,

00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:47.278
the results were the same every time:

00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:51.786
the experiment had been
a resounding success.

00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:54.471
Evelyn Forget discovered

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:57.079
that the people in Dauphin
had not only become richer

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.634
but also smarter and healthier.

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:02.164
The school performance of kids
improved substantially.

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:07.384
The hospitalization rate decreased
by as much as 8.5 percent.

00:09:08.122 --> 00:09:09.932
Domestic violence incidents were down,

00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:11.747
as were mental health complaints.

00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:14.209
And people didn't quit their jobs.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:18.243
The only ones who worked a little less
were new mothers and students --

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.712
who stayed in school longer.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.763
Similar results have since been found

00:09:22.787 --> 00:09:25.183
in countless other experiments
around the globe,

00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:27.454
from the US to India.

00:09:29.613 --> 00:09:30.833
So ...

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.014
here's what I've learned.

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:36.151
When it comes to poverty,

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:41.291
we, the rich, should stop
pretending we know best.

00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.965
We should stop sending shoes
and teddy bears to the poor,

00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:46.510
to people we have never met.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:50.067
And we should get rid of the vast
industry of paternalistic bureaucrats

00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.272
when we could simply
hand over their salaries

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.102
to the poor they're supposed to help.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.422
(Applause)

00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:59.319
Because, I mean, the great
thing about money

00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:01.694
is that people can use it
to buy things they need

00:10:01.718 --> 00:10:04.871
instead of things that self-appointed
experts think they need.

00:10:05.882 --> 00:10:10.286
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists
and entrepreneurs and writers,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.461
like George Orwell,

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.275
are now withering away in scarcity.

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:16.755
Imagine how much energy
and talent we would unleash

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:19.518
if we got rid of poverty once and for all.

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:23.894
I believe that a basic income would work
like venture capital for the people.

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:27.137
And we can't afford not to do it,

00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:30.006
because poverty is hugely expensive.

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.938
Just look at the cost of child poverty
in the US, for example.

00:10:33.962 --> 00:10:38.194
It's estimated at 500 billion
dollars each year,

00:10:38.218 --> 00:10:41.166
in terms of higher health care
spending, higher dropout rates,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.573
and more crime.

00:10:42.597 --> 00:10:46.477
Now, this is an incredible waste
of human potential.

00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:50.566
But let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

00:10:51.326 --> 00:10:54.338
How could we ever afford
a basic income guarantee?

00:10:55.052 --> 00:10:58.151
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper
than you may think.

00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:01.739
What they did in Dauphin is finance it
with a negative income tax.

00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:03.771
This means that your income is topped up

00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:06.207
as soon as you fall
below the poverty line.

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.593
And in that scenario,

00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.131
according to our economists'
best estimates,

00:11:10.155 --> 00:11:13.180
for a net cost of 175 billion --

00:11:13.204 --> 00:11:18.111
a quarter of US military spending,
one percent of GDP --

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:21.689
you could lift all impoverished Americans
above the poverty line.

00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:25.707
You could actually eradicate poverty.

00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:27.944
Now, that should be our goal.

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:29.800
(Applause)

00:11:29.824 --> 00:11:32.756
The time for small thoughts
and little nudges is past.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.088
I really believe that the time has come
for radical new ideas,

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.312
and basic income is so much more
than just another policy.

00:11:39.336 --> 00:11:43.974
It is also a complete rethink
of what work actually is.

00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:45.668
And in that sense,

00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:47.484
it will not only free the poor,

00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:50.000
but also the rest of us.

00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:53.507
Nowadays, millions of people feel

00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.037
that their jobs have little
meaning or significance.

00:11:56.061 --> 00:11:58.878
A recent poll among 230,000 employees

00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:00.808
in 142 countries

00:12:00.832 --> 00:12:05.497
found that only 13 percent of workers
actually like their job.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.267
And another poll found that as much
as 37 percent of British workers

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:13.221
have a job that they think
doesn't even need to exist.

00:12:14.387 --> 00:12:16.681
It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,"

00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:20.361
"Too often we're working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need."

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:21.863
(Laughter)

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.284
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:25.862
I'm not talking about the teachers
and the garbagemen

00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:27.368
and the care workers here.

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.006
If they stopped working,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.347
we'd be in trouble.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.615
I'm talking about all those well-paid
professionals with excellent résumés

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.444
who earn their money doing ...

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:38.504
strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings

00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:41.560
while brainstorming the value
add-on of disruptive co-creation

00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:42.757
in the network society.

00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:43.804
(Laughter)

00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:44.846
(Applause)

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.072
Or something like that.

00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:49.020
Just imagine again how much
talent we're wasting,

00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:52.884
simply because we tell our kids
they'll have to "earn a living."

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:57.380
Or think of what a math whiz working
at Facebook lamented a few years ago:

00:12:57.404 --> 00:12:59.266
"The best minds of my generation

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.403
are thinking about how
to make people click ads."

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:05.944
I'm a historian.

00:13:06.992 --> 00:13:09.061
And if history teaches us anything,

00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:11.877
it is that things could be different.

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:13.292
There is nothing inevitable

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:16.273
about the way we structured our society
and economy right now.

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.653
Ideas can and do change the world.

00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:21.188
And I think that especially
in the past few years,

00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:22.641
it has become abundantly clear

00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:24.618
that we cannot stick to the status quo --

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:26.217
that we need new ideas.

00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:31.712
I know that many of you
may feel pessimistic

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:33.799
about a future of rising inequality,

00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:35.100
xenophobia

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:36.320
and climate change.

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:39.204
But it's not enough
to know what we're against.

00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:40.840
We also need to be for something.

00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:43.398
Martin Luther King didn't say,
"I have a nightmare."

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.295
(Laughter)

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:46.478
He had a dream.

00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:47.581
(Applause)

00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:48.757
So ...

00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:51.060
here's my dream:

00:13:52.303 --> 00:13:53.941
I believe in a future

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.318
where the value of your work
is not determined

00:13:56.342 --> 00:13:57.819
by the size of your paycheck,

00:13:57.843 --> 00:13:59.875
but by the amount of happiness you spread

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:01.876
and the amount of meaning you give.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.132
I believe in a future

00:14:03.156 --> 00:14:06.816
where the point of education is not
to prepare you for another useless job

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.450
but for a life well-lived.

00:14:09.204 --> 00:14:10.483
I believe in a future

00:14:10.507 --> 00:14:13.601
where an existence
without poverty is not a privilege

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.638
but a right we all deserve.

00:14:15.662 --> 00:14:17.127
So here we are.

00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:18.302
Here we are.

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:20.516
We've got the research,
we've got the evidence

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.703
and we've got the means.

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:25.636
Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More
first wrote about a basic income,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.715
and 100 years after George Orwell
discovered the true nature of poverty,

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:32.180
we all need to change our worldview,

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:35.193
because poverty
is not a lack of character.

00:14:35.832 --> 00:14:38.400
Poverty is a lack of cash.

00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:40.505
Thank you.

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:44.952
(Applause)
