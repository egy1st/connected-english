WEBVTT

00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:03.012
I have a confession.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.485
I have been in an affair

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.712
since I was 17 years old.

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:14.731
I wish I could talk about
butterflies in my stomach

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.594
or maps I drew on the ground

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.903
when I think about this affair,

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:21.346
but I cannot.

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:25.336
I wish I could talk about
sweet words spoken

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.433
or gifts that I received

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:29.177
from this affair,

00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:30.677
but I cannot.

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:35.097
All I can tell you about is the aftermath,

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:39.674
about days I spent constantly asking:

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:43.071
Why, why, why me?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.565
I remember how it all began.

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:51.055
I was in my final year of high school,

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.202
and my class had just won in sports,

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:58.945
so we were singing and dancing
and hugging each other.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.753
I went and took a shower.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.361
Then I went for dinner.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.491
And when I sat down to eat,

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:08.065
my teeth started chattering,

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.624
and so I couldn't put
the spoon in my mouth.

00:01:10.648 --> 00:01:13.202
I rushed to the nurse's office,

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:16.402
and because I couldn't talk,
I just pointed at my mouth.

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:18.950
She didn't know what was happening,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.058
so she told me to lie down,

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.354
and it worked --

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:24.841
after a few minutes,
the chattering stopped.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:29.293
I was about to dash out,
and she told me --

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:33.447
no, she insisted -- that I go up
to the dormitories to sleep.

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.382
Here I was in my final year
of high school,

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:41.961
just a few months from doing
my end of high school exams

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:46.874
and a few days from doing a set
of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks,"

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:52.579
which are somehow meant to gauge
how prepared one is for the final exams.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:54.895
There is no way I was going to sleep

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.363
and let a set of exams mock me.

00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:00.390
I went to class, sat down,

00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:02.769
took my Kenyan history notes,

00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:06.558
and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,

00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:09.065
with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:14.087
the Giriama woman who led her people
against British colonial rule.

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.415
Then, without any notice,

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.216
my left hand started jerking,

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.291
and it was as if I was marking
imaginary papers.

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:28.479
In and out it went,

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.328
and with every stroke, one by one,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.835
my classmates stopped
concentrating on their reading

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.893
and started looking at me.

00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:41.227
And I tried really hard to stop it,

00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.907
but I couldn't,

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.981
because it had a life of its own.

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:50.909
And then, when it was sure
everybody was looking at us,

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:55.123
in its final show
and official introduction,

00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:57.956
I had my first full-blown seizure,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.133
which was the beginning of what
has been a 15-year-long affair.

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:12.096
Seizures are the trademark characteristic
for most types of epilepsy,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.598
and every first-ever seizure
needs to be assessed by a doctor

00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:19.125
to determine if one has epilepsy

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.835
or if it's a symptom of something else.

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.715
In my case, it was confirmed
that I had epilepsy.

00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:31.166
I spent a large chunk of my time
in hospital and at home,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.475
and only went back to do my final exams.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:39.284
I had seizures in between papers,

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:41.444
but managed to get good enough grades

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:44.728
to be admitted for an actuarial
science degree

00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:46.343
at the University of Nairobi.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:49.815
(Applause)

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.273
Unfortunately, I had to drop out
in my second year.

00:03:57.297 --> 00:03:59.740
I didn't have good enough coping skills

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:01.900
and a support community around me.

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.405
I was lucky enough to get a job,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.914
but I was fired from that job
when I had a seizure in the workplace.

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:14.825
So I found myself in a space

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.281
where I was constantly asking myself

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.776
why this had to happen to me.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.586
I lived in denial for a long time,

00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:32.305
and the denial was maybe because
of the things that had happened,

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:35.049
dropping out of school
and being fired from my job.

00:04:35.703 --> 00:04:39.718
Or maybe it was because of the things
I had heard about epilepsy

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.327
and about people living with epilepsy:

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:44.583
that they would never live on their own;

00:04:44.607 --> 00:04:46.848
that they would never travel on their own

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:48.292
or even get work;

00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:51.220
that they were outcasts,

00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:55.067
with a spirit in them that they needed
to be delivered from.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:05:00.289
And so the more I thought
about these things,

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:03.990
the more my seizures became,

00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:07.119
and I spent days with my legs locked,

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:10.564
my speech became blurred

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:14.249
and on days on end, this is how I'd be.

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:17.080
Two or three days after a seizure,

00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:20.334
my head and my hand
would still be twitching.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.863
I felt lost,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.624
like I'd lost everything,

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:28.990
and sometimes,

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:32.495
even the will to live.

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:43.066
(Sigh)

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:51.092
I had so much frustration in me.

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:53.548
And so I started writing,

00:05:53.572 --> 00:05:56.411
because the people around me
didn't have answers

00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:58.390
to the questions that I had.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.811
And so I wrote my fears

00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:03.135
and my doubts.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:08.196
I wrote about my good days
and my bad days and my really ugly days,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.970
and I shared them on a blog.

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.416
And before long,

00:06:13.488 --> 00:06:17.119
I began to be seen and heard
by people who had epilepsy

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.577
and their families,

00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:21.437
and even those who did not
have the diagnosis.

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:26.043
And I moved from that girl
who constantly asked why me

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:28.854
to one who not only self-advocates,

00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:32.370
but does it for those who are yet
to find their voices.

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:40.227
(Applause)

00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:47.025
My seizures are greatly reduced,
from two to three times a day,

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:50.456
to sometimes two to three
times in one year.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.690
I went on --

00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:55.678
(Applause)

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.083
I went on to employ five people,

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:02.368
when I began what was Kenya's first

00:07:02.392 --> 00:07:05.470
free mental health
and epilepsy support line.

00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:07.184
And I travel --

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.505
(Applause)

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.027
And I travel to speak about my affair,

00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:16.408
all these things that I had been told

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:20.789
people like me living with epilepsy
could never be able to do.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.506
Every year, a population
as big as 80 percent of Nairobi

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.295
gets diagnosed with epilepsy

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.758
across the globe.

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:32.505
And they, like me,

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:37.459
go through the emotions
of stigma and exclusion.

00:07:38.602 --> 00:07:42.078
And so I have made it my life journey

00:07:42.102 --> 00:07:44.686
to keep these conversations going,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.885
and I keep confessing about my affair

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:51.263
so that those people who do not
have the diagnosis

00:07:51.287 --> 00:07:55.224
might know and might have
a constant reminder

00:07:55.248 --> 00:07:58.428
that it is alright to engage
with people like us,

00:07:58.452 --> 00:08:04.012
that as long as they pull down
the walls of stigma and exclusion,

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:06.253
that we, just like them,

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:09.957
can be able to take anything
life throws at us.

00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.164
Thank you.

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:15.591
(Applause)
