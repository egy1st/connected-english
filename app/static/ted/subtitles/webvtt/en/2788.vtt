00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.776
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.416
daughter of Annette,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.216
daughter of Olympia,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.776
daughter of Melvina,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.096
daughter of Katie, born 1878,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.880
Parish County, Louisiana.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.496
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.256
daughter of Carol,
daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.656
daughter of Sarah,
born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.696
VG: And in the tradition of our families,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.016
the great oral tradition
of almost every Black church we know

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.936
honoring the culture
from which we draw so much power,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.416
we're gonna start the way our mommas
and grandmas would want us to start.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.096
TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.256
the meditation of our hearts,
be acceptable in thy sight,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.680
oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.496
VG: We call the names and rituals
of our ancestors into this room today

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.976
because from them we received
a powerful blueprint for survival,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.576
strategies and tactics for healing
carried across oceans by African women,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.936
passed down to generations
of Black women in America

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.296
who used those skills
to navigate institutions of slavery

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.216
and state-sponsored discrimination

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.536
in order that we might
stand on this stage.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.296
We walk in the footsteps of those women,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.616
our foremothers, legends

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.576
like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,
Fannie Lou Hamer,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.496
from whom we learned
the power of organizing

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.456
after she would had
single-handedly registered

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.280
60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.336
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,
so if you can imagine

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.816
me and Vanessa inspiring
60,000 women to walk with us last year,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.320
we were fired up.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.776
But today, 100,000 Black women and girls
stand on this stage with us.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.456
We are committed to healing ourselves,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.256
to lacing up our sneakers,
to walking out of our front door

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.816
every single day for total healing
and transformation in our communities,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.456
because we understand

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.976
that we are in the footsteps
of a civil rights legacy

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.096
like no other time before,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.056
and that we are facing a health crisis
like never ever before.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.096
And so we've had
a lot of moments, great moments,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.576
including the time we had on our pajamas,
we were working on our computer

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.656
and Michelle Obama emailed us
and invited us to the White House,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.056
and we thought it was spam.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.496
But this moment here is an opportunity.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.256
It is an opportunity
that we don't take for granted,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.016
and so we thought long and hard
about how we would use it.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.736
Would we talk to the women
we hope to inspire,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.496
a million in the next year,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.160
or would we talk to you?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.560
We decided to talk to you,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.040
and to talk to you about a question
that we get all the time,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.656
so that the millions of women
who hopefully will watch this

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.360
will never have to answer it again.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.136
It is: Why are Black women dying

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.096
faster and at higher rates

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.576
than any other group of people in America

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.840
from preventable,
obesity-related diseases?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.176
The question hurts me.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.616
I'm shaking a little bit.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.296
It feels value-laden.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.160
It hurts my body because the weight
represents so much.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.856
But we're going to talk about it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.136
and invite you into
an inside conversation today

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.360
because it is necessary,
and because we need you.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.336
VG: Each night,
before the first day of school,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.016
my grandmother
would sit me next to the stove

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.856
and with expert precision
use a hot comb to press my hair.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.376
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.336
She filled up a room with laughter
and oftentimes curse words.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.336
She cooked a mean peach cobbler,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.896
had 11 children,
a house full of grandchildren,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.376
and like every Black woman I know,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.136
like most all women I know,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.496
she had prioritized the care of others
over caring for herself.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.256
We measured her strength by her capacity
to endure pain and suffering.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.136
We celebrated her for it,
and our choice would prove to be deadly.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.496
One night after pressing my hair
before the first day of eighth grade,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.336
my grandmother went to bed
and never woke up,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.696
dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.576
By the time I would graduate college,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.096
I would lose two more beloved
family members to chronic disease:

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.456
my aunt Diane, dead at 55,
my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.296
After living with these losses,
the hole that they left,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.815
I decided to calculate the life expectancy
of the women in my family.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.720
Staring back at me, the number 65.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.896
I knew I could not sit by

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.136
and watch another woman I loved
die an early death.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.856
TMD: So we don't usually
put our business in the streets.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.336
Let's just put that out there.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.296
But I have to tell you the statistics.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.096
Black women are dying at alarming rates,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.976
and I used to be a classroom teacher,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.896
and I was at South Atlanta High School,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.256
and I remember standing
in front of my classroom,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.976
and I remember a statistic
that half of Black girls will get diabetes

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120
unless diet and levels of activity change.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.760
Half of the girls in my classroom.
So I couldn't teach anymore.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.616
So I started taking girls hiking,
which is why we're called GirlTrek,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.856
but Vanessa was like,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.056
that is not going to move the dial
on the health crisis; it's cute.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.936
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.616
So what we thought

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.800
is if we could rally
a million of their mothers ...

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.865
82 percent of Black women
are over a healthy weight right now.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.600
53 percent of us are obese.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.840
But the number that I cannot,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.416
that I cannot get out of my head

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.816
is that every single day in America,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.376
137 Black women

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.496
die from a preventable disease,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.736
heart disease.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.960
That's every 11 minutes.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.136
137 is more than gun violence,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.656
cigarette smoking and HIV combined,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.016
every day.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.696
It is roughly the amount of people

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.120
that were on my plane
from New Jersey to Vancouver.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.856
Can you imagine that?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.336
A plane filled with Black women
crashing to the ground every day,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.840
and no one is talking about it.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.936
VG: So the question that you're all
asking yourselves right now is why?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.056
Why are Black women dying?
We asked ourselves that same question.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.496
Why is what's out there
not working for them?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.176
Private weight loss companies,
government interventions,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.536
public health campaigns.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.016
I'm going to tell you why:

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.656
because they focus on weight loss

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.176
or looking good in skinny jeans

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.216
without acknowledging the trauma

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.136
that Black women
hold in our bellies and bones,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.976
that has been embedded in our very DNA.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.336
The best advice
from hospitals and doctors,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.856
the best medications
from pharmaceutical companies

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.256
to treat the congestive heart failure
of my grandmother didn't work

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.896
because they didn't acknowledge
the systemic racism

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.656
that she had dealt with since birth.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.696
(Applause)

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.056
A divestment in schools,
discriminatory housing practices,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.136
predatory lending,
a crack cocaine epidemic,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.536
mass incarceration putting
more Black bodies behind bars

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.776
than were owned at the height of slavery.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.576
But GirlTrek does.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.336
For Black women whose bodies
are buckling under the weight

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.056
of systems never designed to support them,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.136
GirlTrek is a lifeline.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.736
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,
a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.016
received the news that too many
Black mothers have received.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.416
Her son Norman, 23 years old,
a father of two,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.920
was gunned down
while on an afternoon drive.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.136
Imagine the grief

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.576
that overcomes your body in that moment,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.320
the immobilizing fear.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.416
Now, know this, that just days
after laying her son to rest,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.176
Danita Kimball posted online,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.936
"I don't know what to do
or how to move forward,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.976
but my sisters keep telling me
I need to walk, so I will."

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.536
And then just days after that,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.816
"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.240
It felt good to be out there, to walk."

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.016
TMD: Walking through pain
is what we have always done.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.320
My mom, she's in the middle right there,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.576
my mom desegregated
her high school in 1955.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.336
Her mom walked down the steps
of an abandoned school bus

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.256
where she raised 11 kids
as a sharecropper.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.456
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.520
fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.136
And her mom walked her man to the door

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.840
as he went off to fight
in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.840
the Civil War.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.776
They were born slaves
but they wouldn't die slaves.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.696
Change-making, it's in my blood.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.976
It's what I do,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.560
and this health crisis ain't nothing
compared to the road we have traveled.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.560
(Applause)

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.336
So it's like James Cleveland.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.896
I don't feel no ways tired,
so we got to work.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.976
We started looking at models of change.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.416
We looked all over the world.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.656
We needed something

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.816
not only that was a part
of our cultural inheritance like walking,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.895
but something that was scalable,
something that was high-impact,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.496
something that we could replicate
across this country.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.936
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.576
for inspiring women
to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.776
She brought Kenya back from the brink
of environmental devastation.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.176
We studied these systems of change,
and we looked at walking scientifically.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.256
And what we learned
is that walking just 30 minutes a day

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.536
can single-handedly decrease
50 percent of your risk of diabetes,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.000
heart disease, stroke,
even Alzheimer's and dementia.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.616
We know that walking
is the single most powerful thing

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.776
that a woman can do for her health,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.576
so we knew we were on to something,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.216
because from Harriet Tubman
to the women in Montgomery,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.056
when Black women walk, things change.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.096
(Applause)

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.656
VG: So how did we take
this simple idea of walking

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.856
and start a revolution
that would catch a fire

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.816
in neighborhoods across America?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.736
We used the best practices
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.416
We huddled up in church basements.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.336
We did grapevine information sharing
through beauty salons.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.256
We empowered and trained mothers
to stand on the front lines.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.776
We took our message
directly to the streets,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.216
and women responded.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.576
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.816
Chrysantha in Detroit,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.376
Onika in New Orleans,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.336
women with difficult names
and difficult stories

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.256
join GirlTrek every day and commit
to walking as a practice of self-care.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.736
Once walking, those women
get to organizing,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.896
first their families,
then their communities,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.736
to walk and talk
and solve problems together.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.856
They walk and notice
the abandoned building.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.896
They walk and notice
the lack of sidewalks,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.176
the lack of green space,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.456
and they say, "No more."

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.376
Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.896
who after walking daily past
an abandoned building in her neighborhood,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.376
decided, "I'm not waiting.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.736
Let me rally my team.
Let me grab some supplies.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.120
Let me do what no one else has done
for me and my community."

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.856
TMD: We know one woman
can make a difference,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.136
because one woman
has already changed the world,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.696
and her name is Harriet Tubman.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.096
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.856
I'm obsessed with her,
and I used to be a history teacher.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.736
I will not tell you the whole history.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.136
I will tell you four things.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.176
So I used to have an old Saab --

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.176
the kind of canvas top that drips
on your head when it rains --

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.105
and I drove all the way down
to the eastern shore of Maryland,

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:45.576
and when I stepped on the dirt

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.536
that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.656
I knew she was a woman just like we are

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.576
and that we could do what she had done,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.896
and we learned four things
from Harriet Tubman.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.696
The first one: do not wait.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.216
Walk right now in the direction
of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.976
because self-care is a revolutionary act.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.336
Number two:

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.576
when you learn the way forward,
come back and get a sister.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.936
So in our case,
start a team with your friends --

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.856
your friends, your family, your church.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.496
Number three:

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.960
rally your allies.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.856
Every single person in this room

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.976
is complicit in
a Tubman-inspired takeover.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.856
And number four:

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.160
find joy.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.176
The most underreported
fact of Harriet Tubman

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.736
is that she lived to be 93 years old,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.096
and she didn't live
just an ordinary life; uh-uh.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.216
She was standing up for the good guys.
She married a younger man.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.456
She adopted a child.
I'm not kidding. She lived.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.296
And I drove up to her house
of freedom in upstate New York,

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.216
and she had planted apple trees,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.896
and when I was there on a Sunday,
they were blooming.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.496
Do you call it -- do they bloom?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.216
The apples were in season,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.800
and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.920
the legacy of Harriet Tubman,
every single year.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.376
And we know that we are Harriet,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.880
and we know that there is a Harriet
in every community in America.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.216
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet
in every community across the globe,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.016
and that they could learn
from our Tubman Doctrine,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.496
as we call it, the four steps.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.216
Imagine the possibilities

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.936
beyond the neighborhoods
of Oakland and Newark,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.096
to the women working
rice fields in Vietnam,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.696
tea fields in Sri Lanka,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.056
the women on the
mountainsides in Guatemala,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.896
the indigenous reservations
throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.456
We believe that women walking

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.896
and talking together
to solve their problems

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.520
is a global solution.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.216
TMD: And I'll leave you with this,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.896
because we also believe it can become
the center of social justice again.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.776
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.216
We had an organizer training,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.856
and I was leaving
and I got on the airplane,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.696
and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.376
and as I'm waiting in that long line
that you guys know,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.416
waiting for people
to put their stuff away,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.136
I looked back and I realized I didn't
know the woman but I recognized her.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.936
And so I blew her a kiss
because it was Sybrina Fulton,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.176
Trayvon Martin's mom,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.440
and she whispered "thank you" back to me.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.496
And I can't help but wonder
what would happen

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.376
if there were groups of women
walking on Trayvon's block that day,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.536
or what would happen
in the South Side of Chicago every day

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.216
if there were groups of women
and mothers and aunts and cousins

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.456
walking,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.200
or along the polluted rivers
of Flint, Michigan.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.016
I believe that walking
can transform our communities,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.640
because it's already starting to.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.736
VG: We believe that
the personal is political.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.536
Our walking is for healing,
for joy, for fresh air,

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.800
quiet time, to connect
and disconnect, to worship.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.456
But it's also walking
so we can be healthy enough

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.616
to stand on the front lines
for change in our communities,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.296
and it is our call to action
to every Black woman listening,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.616
every Black woman in earshot of our voice,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.176
every Black woman who you know.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.376
Think about it: the woman working
front desk reception at your job,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.776
the woman who delivers
your mail, your neighbor --

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.256
our call to action to them,
to join us on the front lines

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.040
for change in your community.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.976
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.176
and why it's so important
for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.176
It's because it's not always easy for us,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.280
and in fact, we have both seen
really, really dark days,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.976
from the hate speech to the summer
of police brutality and violence

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.400
that we saw last year,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.976
to even losing one of our walkers,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.200
Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.416
But the most courageous thing
we do every day is we practice faith

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.776
that goes beyond the facts,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.616
and we put feet to our prayers
every single day,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.296
and when we get overwhelmed,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.696
we think of the words of people
like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.096
who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.736
Where is the fire that burned
holes through slave ships

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.976
to make us breathe?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.336
Where is the fire
that turned guts into chitlins,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.136
that took rhythms and make jazz,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.816
that took sit-ins and marches
and made us jump boundaries and barriers?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.496
You've got to find it and pass it on."

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.896
So this is us finding our fire
and passing it on to you.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.256
So please, stand with us,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.896
walk with us as we rally a million women

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.816
to reclaim the streets
of the 50 highest need communities

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.216
in this country.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.616
We thank you so much for this opportunity.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.560
(Applause)
