00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.418
I want to share with you
something my father taught me:

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.718
no condition is permanent.

00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:12.167
It's a lesson he shared with me
again and again,

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:15.738
and I learned it to be true the hard way.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.507
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.265
This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.001
in Monrovia, Liberia.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:29.915
My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.387
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:34.922
I was nine years old,

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:36.708
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.979
and I was a total math and science geek.

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:43.231
I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.906
But no condition is permanent.

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.269
On Christmas Eve in 1989,

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:53.824
civil war erupted in Liberia.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.036
The war started in the rural countryside,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.767
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.461
My school shut down,

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.957
and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.466
people started panicking and fleeing.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.108
My mom came knocking one morning
and said, "Raj, pack your things --

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:14.421
we have to go."

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.224
We were rushed to the center of town,

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:21.421
and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.126
I stood with my family in one line,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.550
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:28.755
of a rescue plane.

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:32.261
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.704
As I looked out the open hatch,

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.567
I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.527
children strapped to their backs.

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:43.360
When they tried to jump in with us,

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:45.743
I watched soldiers restrain them.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.404
They were not allowed to flee.

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:50.619
We were the lucky ones.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.101
We lost what we had,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.537
but we resettled in America,

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.692
and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.054
that rallied around us.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.735
They took my family into their home,

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.086
they mentored me.

00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:08.239
And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:10.632
I'd visit my father
on weekends as a teenager

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.110
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.467
And every time business would get bad,

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:17.974
he'd remind me of that mantra:

00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:19.923
no condition is permanent.

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:25.222
That mantra and my parents' persistence
and that community of supporters

00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:27.571
made it possible for me
to go through college

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.312
and eventually to medical school.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.104
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.305
but because of them,

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.194
I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.135
My condition had changed.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.426
It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.219
but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.

00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:50.763
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.021
and I wanted to go back

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.915
to see if I could serve
the people we'd left behind.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.935
But when I got back,

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.786
what I found was utter destruction.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.931
The war had left us with just 51 doctors

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.393
to serve a country of four million people.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.900
It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.484
So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:11.957
you might stand a chance.

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.847
But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.236
where you could be days
from the nearest clinic --

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.001
I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.168
all because they were
getting to me too late.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:27.614
Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:30.042
and you realize she could have malaria,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:33.067
and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:34.944
would be to take her to the riverbed,

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.043
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.682
and then walk for up to two days
through the forest

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.513
just to reach the nearest clinic.

00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:45.276
One billion people live
in the world's most remote communities,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.945
and despite the advances we've made
in modern medicine and technology,

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.668
our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:53.653
These communities have been left behind,

00:03:53.677 --> 00:03:55.876
because they've been thought
too hard to reach

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.450
and too difficult to serve.

00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:59.969
Illness is universal;

00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:02.198
access to care is not.

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.784
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:09.066
No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.535
No condition should be permanent.

00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.004
And help in this case
didn't come from the outside,

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:17.681
it actually came from within.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.706
It came from the communities themselves.

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:21.537
Meet Musu.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.946
Way out in rural Liberia,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.139
where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:28.686
Musu had been persistent.

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.414
At the age of 18,
she completed high school,

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.264
and she came back to her community.

00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:37.410
She saw that none of the children
were getting treatment

00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:39.561
for the diseases
they needed treatment for --

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:41.905
deadly diseases, like malaria
and pneumonia.

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:44.046
So she signed up to be a volunteer.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.480
There are millions of volunteers like Musu
in rural parts around our world,

00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:51.277
and we got to thinking --

00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.785
community members like Musu
could actually help us solve a puzzle.

00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:58.780
Our health care system
is structured in such a way

00:04:58.804 --> 00:05:02.512
that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:05.644
is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.

00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:09.063
But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,

00:05:09.087 --> 00:05:12.423
so rural communities like Musu's
have been left behind.

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:14.657
So we started asking some questions:

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.214
What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:20.156
What if we could have community
members like Musu

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.457
be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:27.406
What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.554
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?

00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.236
Musu was 48 when I met her.

00:05:34.016 --> 00:05:37.069
And despite her amazing talent and grit,

00:05:37.093 --> 00:05:40.294
she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:43.849
So what if technology could support her?

00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:48.678
What if we could invest in her
with real training,

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.982
equip her with real medicines,

00:05:51.828 --> 00:05:55.054
and have her have a real job?

00:05:56.404 --> 00:06:00.868
Well, in 2007, I was trying
to answer these questions,

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:03.465
and my wife and I were
getting married that year.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.593
We asked our relatives to forgo
the wedding registry gifts

00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:10.167
and instead donate some money

00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.432
so we could have some start-up money
to launch a nonprofit.

00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:16.555
I promise you, I'm a lot
more romantic than that.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:17.729
(Laughter)

00:06:18.163 --> 00:06:20.556
We ended up raising $6,000,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.708
teamed up with some
Liberians and Americans

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.470
and launched a nonprofit
called Last Mile Health.

00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:30.397
Our goal is to bring a health worker
within reach of everyone, everywhere.

00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:32.355
We designed a three-step process --

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:33.843
train, equip and pay --

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:37.224
to invest more deeply
in volunteers like Musu

00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:38.847
to become paraprofessionals,

00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.045
to become community health workers.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.626
First we trained Musu to prevent,
diagnose and treat

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.359
the top 10 diseases afflicting
families in her village.

00:06:49.903 --> 00:06:53.157
A nurse supervisor visited her
every month to coach her.

00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:56.424
We equipped her with modern
medical technology,

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:59.818
like this $1 malaria rapid test,

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:03.571
and put it in a backpack
full of medicines like this

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:05.952
to treat infections like pneumonia,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.157
and crucially,

00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:12.469
a smartphone, to help her track
and report on epidemics.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.437
Last, we recognized
the dignity in Musu's work.

00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:18.894
With the Liberian government,
we created a contract,

00:07:18.918 --> 00:07:20.204
paid her

00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:22.321
and gave her the chance
to have a real job.

00:07:22.345 --> 00:07:23.514
And she's amazing.

00:07:23.538 --> 00:07:27.024
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,

00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:29.807
from screening children for malnutrition,

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:33.304
to assessing the cause
of a child's cough with a smartphone,

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.449
to supporting people with HIV

00:07:36.473 --> 00:07:40.270
and providing follow-up care
to patients who've lost their limbs.

00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:44.050
Working as part of our team,

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:45.599
working as paraprofessionals,

00:07:45.623 --> 00:07:47.852
community health workers can help ensure

00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:50.173
that a lot of what
your family doctor would do

00:07:50.197 --> 00:07:54.017
reaches the places that most
family doctors could never go.

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.982
One of my favorite things to do
is to care for patients

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.455
with community health workers.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.792
So last year I was visiting A.B.,

00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:04.455
and like Musu, A.B. had had
a chance to go to school.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:07.556
He was in middle school,
in the eighth grade,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.846
when his parents died.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.436
He became an orphan and had to drop out.

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:17.327
Last year, we hired and trained
A.B. as a community health worker.

00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:21.081
And while he was making
door to door house calls,

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:23.328
he met this young boy named Prince,

00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:26.625
whose mother had had trouble
breastfeeding him,

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:29.861
and by the age of six months,
Prince had started to waste away.

00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:33.494
A.B. had just been taught how to use
this color-coded measuring tape

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:37.064
that wraps around the upper arm
of a child to diagnose malnutrition.

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:39.479
A.B. noticed that Prince
was in the red zone,

00:08:39.503 --> 00:08:41.394
which meant he had to be hospitalized.

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:44.060
So A.B. took Prince
and his mother to the river,

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:45.251
got in a canoe

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.935
and paddled for four hours
to get to the hospital.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:50.164
Later, after Prince was discharged,

00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:55.078
A.B. taught mom how to feed baby
a food supplement.

00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:57.902
A few months ago,

00:08:57.926 --> 00:09:01.142
A.B. took me to visit Prince,
and he's a chubby little guy.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.297
(Laughter)

00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:05.493
He's meeting his milestones,
he's pulled himself up to a stand,

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.474
and is even starting to say a few words.

00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:09.997
I'm so inspired by these
community health workers.

00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.309
I often ask them why they do what they do,

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.067
and when I asked A.B.,

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.929
he said, "Doc, since I dropped out
of school, this is the first time

00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:21.332
I'm having a chance
to hold a pen to write.

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:24.306
My brain is getting fresh."

00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:29.782
The stories of A.B. and Musu
have taught me something fundamental

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.114
about being human.

00:09:32.276 --> 00:09:34.332
Our will to serve others

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:38.805
can actually help us
transform our own conditions.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:43.806
I was so moved by how powerful
the will to serve our neighbors can be

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.128
a few years ago,

00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:48.007
when we faced a global catastrophe.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.362
In December 2013,

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.961
something happened in the rainforests
across the border from us in Guinea.

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:58.585
A toddler named Emile fell sick
with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.

00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:00.918
He lived in an area
where the roads were sparse

00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:03.848
and there had been massive
shortages of health workers.

00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:05.988
Emile died,

00:10:06.012 --> 00:10:07.869
and a few weeks later his sister died,

00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:09.813
and a few weeks later his mother died.

00:10:09.837 --> 00:10:13.012
And this disease would spread
from one community to another.

00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:15.061
And it wasn't until three months later

00:10:15.085 --> 00:10:17.867
that the world recognized this as Ebola.

00:10:18.304 --> 00:10:21.002
When every minute counted,
we had already lost months,

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:24.479
and by then the virus had spread
like wildfire all across West Africa,

00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:26.529
and eventually to other
parts of the world.

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:29.851
Businesses shut down,
airlines started canceling routes.

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.291
At the height of the crisis,

00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:35.760
when we were told that 1.4 million
people could be infected,

00:10:35.784 --> 00:10:39.287
when we were told
that most of them would die,

00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:41.725
when we had nearly lost all hope,

00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:46.550
I remember standing with a group
of health workers

00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:49.332
in the rainforest where
an outbreak had just happened.

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:52.345
We were helping train and equip
them to put on the masks,

00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:54.409
the gloves and the gowns that they needed

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.428
to keep themselves safe from the virus

00:10:56.452 --> 00:10:58.760
while they were serving their patients.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:01.085
I remember the fear in their eyes.

00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:07.078
And I remember staying up at night,
terrified if I'd made the right call

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:09.908
to keep them in the field.

00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:14.642
When Ebola threatened to bring
humanity to its knees,

00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:18.569
Liberia's community health workers
didn't surrender to fear.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.107
They did what they had always done:

00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:25.085
they answered the call
to serve their neighbors.

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:29.354
Community members across Liberia
learned the symptoms of Ebola,

00:11:29.378 --> 00:11:32.931
teamed up with nurses and doctors
to go door-to-door to find the sick

00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:34.511
and get them into care.

00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:37.945
They tracked thousands of people
who had been exposed to the virus

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:40.392
and helped break
the chain of transmission.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:43.726
Some ten thousand community
health workers risked their own lives

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.958
to help hunt down this virus
and stop it in its tracks.

00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:53.412
(Applause)

00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:58.206
Today, Ebola has come
under control in West Africa,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.851
and we've learned a few things.

00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:02.947
We've learned that blind spots
in rural health care

00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:04.769
can lead to hot spots of disease,

00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:07.209
and that places all of us at greater risk.

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:10.394
We've learned that the most efficient
emergency system

00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.446
is actually an everyday system,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.196
and that system has to reach
all communities,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.495
including rural communities like Emile's.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.691
And most of all,

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:23.176
we've learned from the courage
of Liberia's community health workers

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.921
that we as people are not defined
by the conditions we face,

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:29.009
no matter how hopeless they seem.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.272
We're defined by how we respond to them.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.351
For the past 15 years,

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:39.252
I've seen the power of this idea

00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:43.373
to transform everyday citizens
into community health workers --

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:45.260
into everyday heroes.

00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:47.926
And I've seen it play out everywhere,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.008
from the forest communities
of West Africa,

00:12:50.032 --> 00:12:52.277
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:54.129
It's true,

00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:57.202
these community health workers
aren't doing neurosurgery,

00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:58.718
but they're making it possible

00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:01.814
to bring health care within reach
of everyone everywhere.

00:13:03.645 --> 00:13:04.862
So now what?

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:09.576
Well, we know that there are still
millions of people dying

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.349
from preventable causes

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.248
in rural communities around the world.

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:17.113
And we know that the great majority
of these deaths are happening

00:13:17.137 --> 00:13:19.460
in these 75 blue-shaded countries.

00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:21.000
What we also know

00:13:21.024 --> 00:13:24.467
is that if we trained an army
of community health workers

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:27.824
to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,

00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:32.624
we could save the lives of nearly
30 million people by 2030.

00:13:33.652 --> 00:13:38.297
Thirty services could save
30 million lives by 2030.

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.064
That's not just a blueprint --

00:13:40.088 --> 00:13:41.883
we're proving this can be done.

00:13:41.907 --> 00:13:43.067
In Liberia,

00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:47.356
the Liberian government is training
thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.538
after Ebola,

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:52.039
to bring health care to every
child and family in the country.

00:13:52.063 --> 00:13:54.094
And we've been honored to work with them,

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:56.626
and are now teaming up
with a number of organizations

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.872
that are working across other countries

00:13:58.896 --> 00:14:00.919
to try to help them do the same thing.

00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:04.695
If we could help these countries scale,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.182
we could save millions of lives,

00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:08.562
and at the same time,

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.367
we could create millions of jobs.

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:14.797
We simply can't do that, though,
without technology.

00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:18.374
People are worried that technology
is going to steal our jobs,

00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:20.597
but when it comes
to community health workers,

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:23.877
technology has actually
been vital for creating jobs.

00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:26.317
Without technology --
without this smartphone,

00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:29.063
without this rapid test --

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.493
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:38.146
And I think it's time
for technology to help us train,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.710
to help us train people faster
and better than ever before.

00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:43.728
As a doctor,

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:47.243
I use technology to stay up-to-date
and keep certified.

00:14:47.267 --> 00:14:49.962
I use smartphones, I use apps,
I use online courses.

00:14:49.986 --> 00:14:52.198
But when A.B. wants to learn,

00:14:52.222 --> 00:14:54.317
he's got to jump back in that canoe

00:14:55.152 --> 00:14:56.792
and get to the training center.

00:14:56.816 --> 00:14:59.008
And when Musu shows up for training,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.315
her instructors are stuck using
flip charts and markers.

00:15:04.147 --> 00:15:08.680
Why shouldn't they have the same
access to learn as I do?

00:15:10.384 --> 00:15:14.012
If we truly want community health workers
to master those lifesaving skills

00:15:14.036 --> 00:15:15.288
and even more,

00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:19.352
we've got to change this old-school
model of education.

00:15:20.282 --> 00:15:22.180
Tech can truly be a game changer here.

00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:25.749
I've been in awe of the digital
education revolution

00:15:25.773 --> 00:15:28.933
that the likes of Khan Academy
and edX have been leading.

00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:32.534
And I've been thinking that it's time;

00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:33.949
it's time for a collision

00:15:33.973 --> 00:15:36.284
between the digital education revolution

00:15:36.308 --> 00:15:38.458
and the community health revolution.

00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:42.703
And so, this brings me
to my TED Prize wish.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.560
I wish --

00:15:45.584 --> 00:15:47.790
I wish that you would help us recruit

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:51.742
the largest army of community health
workers the world has ever known

00:15:52.068 --> 00:15:54.893
by creating the Community Health Academy,

00:15:54.917 --> 00:15:58.122
a global platform to train,
connect and empower.

00:15:58.797 --> 00:15:59.963
(Applause)

00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:01.150
Thank you.

00:16:01.175 --> 00:16:04.777
(Applause)

00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:05.959
Thank you.

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:09.360
Here's the idea:

00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:11.454
we'll create and curate

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:15.941
the best in digital education resources.

00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:21.437
We will bring those to community
health workers around the world,

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.714
including A.B. and Musu.

00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:25.540
They'll get video lessons
on giving kids vaccines

00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:28.777
and have online courses
on spotting the next outbreak,

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.684
so they're not stuck using flip charts.

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:34.544
We'll help these countries
accredit these workers,

00:16:34.568 --> 00:16:39.275
so that they're not stuck remaining
an under-recognized, undervalued group,

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:42.036
but become a renowned,
empowered profession,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.821
just like nurses and doctors.

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:48.729
And we'll create a network
of companies and entrepreneurs

00:16:48.753 --> 00:16:51.029
who've created innovations
that can save lives

00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.433
and help them connect
to workers like Musu,

00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:56.032
so she can help better
serve her community.

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:00.165
And we'll work tirelessly
to persuade governments

00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:04.171
to make community health workers
a cornerstone of their health care plans.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:09.523
We plan to test and prototype
the academy in Liberia

00:17:09.547 --> 00:17:11.419
and a few other partner countries,

00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:13.230
and then we plan to take it global,

00:17:13.254 --> 00:17:15.477
including to rural North America.

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.693
With the power of this platform,

00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:20.279
we believe countries can be more persuaded

00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:23.628
that a health care revolution
really is possible.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.558
My dream is that this academy
will contribute to the training

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:30.794
of hundreds of thousands
of community members

00:17:30.818 --> 00:17:33.717
to help bring health care
to their neighbors --

00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:35.351
the hundreds of millions of them

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:37.996
that live in the world's most
remote communities,

00:17:38.785 --> 00:17:40.866
from the forest communities
of West Africa,

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.030
to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;

00:17:43.054 --> 00:17:47.116
from the hilltops of Appalachia,
to the mountains of Afghanistan.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.830
If this vision is aligned with yours,

00:17:49.854 --> 00:17:53.075
head to communityhealthacademy.org,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.420
and join this revolution.

00:17:56.536 --> 00:18:01.189
Let us know if you or your organization
or someone you know could help us

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:04.444
as we try to build this academy
over the next year.

00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:07.530
Now, as I look out into this room,

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.016
I realize that our journeys
are not self-made;

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.549
they're shaped by others.

00:18:12.573 --> 00:18:16.416
And there have been so many here
that have been part of this cause.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.650
We're so honored to be part
of this community,

00:18:19.674 --> 00:18:22.357
and a community that's willing
to take on a cause

00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:23.749
as audacious as this one,

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:25.848
so I wanted to offer, as I end,

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:27.094
a reflection.

00:18:27.986 --> 00:18:30.973
I think a lot more about
what my father taught me.

00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:33.927
These days, I too have become a dad.

00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:35.967
I have two sons,

00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:39.979
and my wife and I just learned
that she's pregnant with our third child.

00:18:40.003 --> 00:18:41.011
(Applause)

00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:42.102
Thank you.

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:43.677
(Applause)

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.884
I was recently caring
for a woman in Liberia

00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:49.633
who, like my wife,
was in her third pregnancy.

00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:52.080
But unlike my wife,

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.957
had had no prenatal care
with her first two babies.

00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:01.941
She lived in an isolated community
in the forest that had gone for 100 years

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:03.354
without any health care

00:19:04.513 --> 00:19:06.141
until ...

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:09.548
until last year when a nurse
trained her neighbors

00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:11.283
to become community health workers.

00:19:11.307 --> 00:19:12.599
So here I was,

00:19:12.623 --> 00:19:16.863
seeing this patient
who was in her second trimester,

00:19:16.887 --> 00:19:20.159
and I pulled out the ultrasound
to check on the baby,

00:19:20.183 --> 00:19:23.722
and she started telling us stories
about her first two kids,

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:26.944
and I had the ultrasound
probe on her belly,

00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:29.236
and she just stopped mid-sentence.

00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:32.762
She turned to me and she said,

00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:35.080
"Doc, what's that sound?"

00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:40.549
It was the first time she'd ever heard
her baby's heartbeat.

00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:47.171
And her eyes lit up in the same way
my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up

00:19:47.195 --> 00:19:49.330
when we heard our baby's heartbeat.

00:19:51.544 --> 00:19:53.697
For all of human history,

00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:58.253
illness has been universal
and access to care has not.

00:19:58.277 --> 00:20:00.163
But as a wise man once told me:

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.178
no condition is permanent.

00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:06.719
It's time.

00:20:06.743 --> 00:20:09.066
It's time for us to go as far as it takes

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.182
to change this condition together.

00:20:11.694 --> 00:20:12.848
Thank you.

00:20:12.872 --> 00:20:17.339
(Applause)
