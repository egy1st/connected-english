WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on a collective level.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we're in denial about,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's like when you're mean to your wife

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because you're mad at somebody else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And when we do these kind of things,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that nobody wants, and no one intended.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And that's what I look at with my photographic work.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is an image I just recently completed, that is --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when you stand back at a distance,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of a factory spewing out pollution.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And as you get a little bit closer,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And as you get all the way up close,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the United States every six hours.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We use four million cups a day on airline flights,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They just don't do that in that industry.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now, that number is dwarfed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the number of paper cups we use every day,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
most of which is coffee.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that's the size it would be.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And there's an hour's worth of our cups.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And there's a day's worth of our cups.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You can still see the little people way down there.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's as high as a 42-story building,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Speaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
has the largest percentage of its population in prison

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
of any country on Earth.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
are Americans, imprisoned in our country.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I wanted to show the number.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and in the actual print of this piece,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that was larger than any printer in the world would print.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
those are my parents looking at the piece.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Every time I look at this piece,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"He finally folded his laundry."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
who die from cigarette smoking.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
from smoking cigarettes.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And, as you slowly step back,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And do you remember the response?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It reverberated around the world,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and will continue to reverberate through time.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And this is what the next piece is about.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which is equal to the number of teenagers

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
begin smoking every year.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
One more strange epidemic in the United States

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that I want to acquaint you with

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that I scanned lots and lots of times.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is the number of hospital emergency room visits

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
yearly in the United States,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and anti-anxiety medications.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
A strange phenomenon.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This is a piece that I just recently completed

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
384,000 women, American women, last year

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
went in for elective breast augmentation surgery.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
given to young girls who are about to go off to college.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that are performed in the U.S. each month.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And strangely enough, the only plastic surgery

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and most of that is being done by men.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They're just examples.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
about what's going on in our culture right now,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
what's going on in our country,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And one of the causes of this, I think,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
this holoptical worldview, this holographic image

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that we're all trying to create in our mind

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the social consequences 10,000 miles away

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
of the daily decisions that we make as consumers.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
As we try to build this view,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in the billions and now in the trillions.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is to take these numbers, these statistics

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from the raw language of data, and to translate them

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
if we can feel these things more deeply,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
then they'll matter to us more than they do now.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And if we can find that,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
what it is that we need to find to face the big question,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
which is: how do we change?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
how do we change? How do we change as a culture,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and how do we each individually take responsibility

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and that is our own behavior?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to look at these issues.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And if there are things that we see

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that we don't like about our culture,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
then we have a choice.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
as we show up for the question of how do we change --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and it will continue to do that, on into the future.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of the billions of people

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I'm not speaking abstractly about this,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
right now, in this moment.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Thank you and good afternoon.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
