00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:05.342
(Music)

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.151
Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.894
but ...

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.202
we can see you really clearly --

00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:13.266
(Laughter)

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.763
So you have to dance with us.

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.193
And we have this, like,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.703
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do --

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:20.938
Betta Lemme: Really easy.

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.779
SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.439
and you're going to do it with us.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.434
And you can also stand up.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:30.984
(Music)

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.010
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:39.597
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.128
It came, it came,

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.318
it went, it went

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.102
It conquered quick

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.705
I was there and then I quit

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.021
Awoo!

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:51.718
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:55.563
I know I did not capture it

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:56.747
It came, it came,

00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:57.937
it went, it went

00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.721
It conquered quick

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:03.080
I was there and then I quit

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.926
Awoo!

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.418
BL: (Speaks) There you go!

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:10.465
(Music)

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.199
SHW: We have another one coming up.

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:13.957
It's a little finger-pointing dance.

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:16.981
(Music)

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.215
The people sitting down,

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.248
I want to see your fingers pointing.

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:34.019
Yeah!

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:38.525
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.408
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:43.599
It came, it came,

00:01:43.623 --> 00:01:44.774
it went, it went

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.585
It conquered quick

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.010
I was there and then I quit

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:55.415
Aaaa ...

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.116
(Applause)

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.362
Awoo!

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.048
(Music)

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:03.390
(Clapping to the beat)

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:11.864
(Music)

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:19.812
Aaaa ...

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:21.917
SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.343
(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:29.181
I know I did not capture it

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:30.362
It came, it came,

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:31.544
it went, it went

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.319
It conquered quick

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.668
I was there and then I quit

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:41.028
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:44.851
I know I did not capture it

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:46.025
It came, it came,

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.201
it went, it went

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.991
It conquered quick

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:53.046
I was there and then I quit

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.497
(Music)

00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:59.723
Tucker Halpern: You guys are way more fun
than I thought you'd be.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:00.965
(Laughter)

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.955
(Music)

00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:09.576
