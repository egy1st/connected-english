00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:03.360
Silicon Valley
is obsessed with disruption,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.240
but these days, the biggest disruptor
didn't come out of Silicon Valley.

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.480
It came out of steel towns in Ohio,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.560
rural communities in Pennsylvania,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.480
the Panhandle in Florida.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.936
And this last US presidential election

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.580
was the mother of all disruptions.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.960
Once again, politics is personal.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.536
Millions of Americans
became activists overnight,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.376
pouring into the streets in record numbers

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.816
in record time.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.656
(Laughter)

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.016
The election has done
to family holiday dinners

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.800
what Uber has done
to New York City's taxi system.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.120
Couples have broken up
and marriages disrupted.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.256
And the election
is doing to my private life

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.320
what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.200
These days, the ACLU
is on the front lines 24/7,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.040
and even if I manage to sneak away
for a couple of miles on the treadmill,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.056
any cardio benefit I get
is instantly obliterated

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.520
when I read another presidential tweet
on the headline scroll.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.936
Even my secret pleasure

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.456
of studying the Italian painters

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.680
have been infected by politics.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.560
Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.856
This is my desk,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.696
with a postcard exhibition

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.576
of some famous and obscure paintings

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
mostly from the Italian Renaissance.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.736
Now, art used to provide me
with a necessary break

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.056
from the hurly-burly of politics

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.456
in my daily work at the ACLU,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.680
but not anymore.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.616
I was at the Women's March
in San Francisco

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.176
the day after inauguration,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.256
and the crowd was chanting,
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.440
"This is what democracy looks like."

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.536
And there I was holding my sign
and my umbrella in the rain,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.376
and I flashed on an old painting

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.520
that first captivated me many years ago.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.856
I struggled to remember
the different pieces

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.216
of an actual painting

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.440
of good and bad government.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640
It was almost like the old master
was taunting me.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.360
You want to know
what democracy looks like?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720
Go back and look at my frescoes.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.160
And so I did.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.936
In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti
finished a monumental commission

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.200
in the governing council chamber
of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a painting that speaks to us,
even screams to us, today.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.256
"Art is a lie that makes us
realize truth,"

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Pablo Picasso once said.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.936
And as we search for the truth
about government,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.856
we should keep Ambrogio's work,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.160
not a lie but an allegory,
in our collective mind's eye.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.976
During Lorenzetti's time,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.296
the political legitimacy
of Italian city-states

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.240
was often on very shaky ground.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.656
Siena was a republic,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.336
but there had been enormous unrest

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.600
in the two decades
leading up to the commission.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.536
Siena's political leaders,
who would literally govern

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.736
under the eyes
of these allegorical figures,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000
were Lorenzetti's intended audience.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.936
He was cataloging the obligations

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.800
of the governing to the governed.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.416
Now, you can spend years
studying these frescoes.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.840
Some scholars have.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.496
I'm hardly an art historian,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.096
but I am passionate about art,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.696
and a work this massive can overwhelm me.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.160
So first, I focus on the big stuff.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.720
This is the allegory of good government.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.976
The majestic figure here in the middle

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.416
is dressed in Siena's colors

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.200
and he personifies the republic itself.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.256
Lorenzetti labels him "Commune,"

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.936
and he's basically telling the Sienese

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.040
that they, and not a king or a tyrant,
must rule themselves.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.880
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.440
Justice is enthroned.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.016
She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.360
who actually supports
her scales of justice.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.536
Concord, or Harmony,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.696
holds a string that comes
off the scales of justice

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.736
that binds her to the citizens,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.560
making them all
compatriots in the republic.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.856
And finally we see Peace.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.336
She looks chilled out,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.736
like she's listening to Bob Marley.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.736
When good government rules,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.640
Peace doesn't break a sweat.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.656
Now, these are big images and big ideas,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.880
but I really love the small stuff.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.896
Along another wall,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.256
Lorenzetti illustrates
the effects of good government

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.656
on the real and everyday lives
of ordinary people

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.560
with a series of delicious little details.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.120
In the countryside,
the hills are landscaped and farmed.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.976
Crops are being sown,
hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.400
all in one picture.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.720
Crops and livestock
are being brought to market.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.800
In the city, builders raise a tower.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.216
People attend a law lecture,
a TED Talk of the 14th century.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.800
(Laughter)

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.920
Schoolchildren play.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.760
Tradesmen thrive.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.960
Dancers larger than life dance with joy.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.920
And watching over the republic
is the winged figure Security,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.016
whose banner reads,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.720
"Everyone shall go forth
freely without fear."

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.936
Now, what's amazing
about these images from 800 years ago

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.880
is that they're familiar to us today.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.856
We see what democracy looks like.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.296
We experience the effects
of good government in our lives,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.280
just as Lorenzetti did in his life.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.896
But it is the allegory of bad government

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.280
that has been haunting me
since November 9.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.776
It's badly damaged,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.680
but it reads like today's newspapers.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.456
And ruling over bad government
is not the Commune

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.680
but the Tyrant.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.776
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.336
braided hair.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.776
He obviously spends
a lot of time on that hair.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.936
(Laughter)

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.256
Justice now lies helpless at his feet,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.576
shackled.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.400
Her scales have been severed.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.096
Justice is the key antagonist
to the Tyrant,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800
and she's been taken out.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.016
Now, surrounding the Tyrant,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.320
Lorenzetti illustrates
the vices that animate bad government.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.976
Avarice is the old woman
clutching the strongbox

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.696
and a fisherman's hook

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.520
to pull in her fortune.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.096
Vainglory carries a mirror,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.176
and Lorenzetti warns us
against narcissistic leaders

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.040
who are guided
by their own ego and vanity.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.120
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.696
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.456
lulls us into a false sense of security

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.280
and then poisons a republic.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.200
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.320
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.840
She's dressed in Siena's colors.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.696
"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.840
She uses a carpenter's saw
to chop her body in half.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.216
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.360
the stone and knife.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.696
In the remainder of the fresco,
Lorenzetti shows us

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.680
the inevitable effects of bad government.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.696
The civic ideals celebrated
elsewhere in this room have failed us,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.256
and we see it.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.016
The once beautiful city
has fallen to pieces,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.856
the countryside barren,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.416
the farms abandoned.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.960
Many are in flames.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.936
And in the sky above
is not the winged figure Security,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.616
but that of Fear, whose banner reads:

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.655
"None shall pass along this road

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.960
without fear of death."

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.696
Now, the final image,
the most important one, really,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.536
is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.816
It is of the viewer.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.616
Today, the audience
for Lorenzetti's frescoes

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.096
is not the governing but the governed,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.936
the individual who stands
in front of his allegories

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.456
and walks away with insight,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.640
who heeds a call to action.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.216
Lorenzetti warns us
that we must recognize the shadows

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.136
of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.856
when they float
across our political landscape,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.696
especially when those shadows are cast

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.376
by political leaders loudly claiming
to be the voice of good government

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.560
and promising to make America great again.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.080
And we must act.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.360
Democracy must not be a spectator sport.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.296
The right to protest,
the right to assemble freely,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.216
the right to petition one's government,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.056
these are not just rights.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.576
In the face of Avarice,
Fraud and Division,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.440
these are obligations.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.256
We have to disrupt --

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.040
(Applause)

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.896
We have to disrupt our lives

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.576
so that we can disrupt

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.336
the amoral accretion of power

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.400
by those who would betray our values.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.936
We and we the people

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.816
must raise justice up

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.776
and must bring peace to our nation

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.976
and must come together in concord,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.720
and we have a choice.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.336
We could either paint ourselves

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.440
into the worst nightmare
of Lorenzetti's bad government,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.960
or we can stay in the streets,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.080
disruptive, messy, loud.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.120
That is what democracy looks like.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.256
Thank you.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.480
(Applause)

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.336
Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.776
Obviously, many people passionately --

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.816
you spoke to many people
passionately here.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.576
I'm sure there are other people here

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.296
who'd say, look, Trump was elected
by 63 million people.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.656
He's far from perfect,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.656
but he's trying to do
what he was elected to do.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.240
Shouldn't you give him a chance?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.816
Anthony Romero:
I think we have to recognize

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.616
the legitimacy of him as president

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.536
versus the legitimacy of his policies.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.336
And when so many of the policies
are contrary to fundamental values,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.296
that we're all equal under the law,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.896
that we're not judged by the color
of our skin or the religion we worship,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.656
we have to contest those values

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.936
even as we recognize and honor the fact

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.440
that our democracy rendered us a president
who is championing those values.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.216
CA: And the ACLU isn't just
this force on the left, right?

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.656
You're making other arguments as well.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.296
AR: Well, you know,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.456
very often we piss
everyone off at one point.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.976
That's what we do.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.416
And we recently were taking stands

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.776
for why Ann Coulter needs
to be able to speak at Berkeley,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.216
and why Milo has free speech rights.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.816
And we even wrote a blog

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.496
that almost burnt the house down
among some of our members,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.616
unfortunately,
when we talked about the fact

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.096
that even Donald Trump
has free speech rights as president,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.176
and an effort to hold him accountable

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.776
for incitement of violence
at his marches or his rallies

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.976
is unconstitutional and un-American.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.176
And when you put that statement out there

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.856
to a very frothy base

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.176
that always is very excited for you
to fight Donald Trump,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.696
and then you have a new one saying,
"Wait, these rights are for everybody,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.616
even the president that we don't like."

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.216
And that's our job.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.376
(Applause)

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.976
CA: Anthony, you spoke
to so many of us so powerfully.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.576
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.560
(Applause)
