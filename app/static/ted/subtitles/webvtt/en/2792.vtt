(Dominoes fall)

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.136
(Toy car)

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.480
(Ball rolls)

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.720
(Music: "This Too Shall Pass")

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.416
(Singing)

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.736
You know you can't keep
letting it get you down,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.800
and you can't keep dragging
that dead weight around.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.736
If there ain't all that much to lug around

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
better run like hell
when you hit the ground

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.920
When the morning comes

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.040
When the morning comes

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.536
You can't stop these kids from dancing,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.976
but why would you want to,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.776
especially when you're
already getting yours?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.736
(Xylophone)

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.136
(Singing) 'Cause if your mind
don't move and your knees don't bend,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760
well don't go blaming the kids again.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.856
(Xylophone)

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.080
(Singing) When the morning comes

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.160
When the morning comes

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.080
When the morning comes

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.080
When the morning comes

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.000
When the morning comes

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080
When the morning comes

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.160
(Xylophone)

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.936
(Singing) Let it go,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.520
this too shall pass

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.896
Let it go,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.736
this too shall pass

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.336
You know you can't keep
letting it get you down,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.176
you can't keep letting it get you down --

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.960
this too shall pass

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.176
If there ain't
all that much to lug around,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.416
you can't keep letting it get you down --

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.896
this too shall pass

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.736
When the morning comes --

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.016
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.896
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.656
When the morning comes --

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.056
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.936
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.776
When the morning comes --

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.056
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.976
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.856
When the morning comes --

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.096
you can't keep letting it get you down,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.976
no you can't keep letting it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.440
When the morning comes

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.056
(Paint guns fire)

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.000
(Applause)

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.776
Damian Kulash:
Thank you, thanks very much.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.656
We are OK Go,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.416
and we've been together
as a band since 1998.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.696
But in the last decade,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.736
we've become known as much
for the elaborate music videos,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.016
like the one we just saw,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.656
as for the songs they accompany.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.776
So we will play along with another
one of those in a few minutes,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.016
but in the meantime,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.376
we want to address this question
that we get asked all the time

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.376
but we've really never come up
with an adequate answer for it,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.920
and that is, how do we
think of those ideas?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.136
The videos are not all
Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.255
Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.055
and once we set up an obstacle course

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.816
out of thousands of musical
instruments in the desert,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.536
and then played them
by stunt driving a car through them.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.576
(Laughter)

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.856
For one of the videos,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.256
we choreographed
hundreds of people with umbrellas

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.656
in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.496
and then filmed them from a drone
a half a mile in the air.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.136
So it's all of these ideas
that people are curious about,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.416
and the reason we've had so much trouble
describing how we think of these ideas

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.840
is that it doesn't really feel
like we think of them at all.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.960
It feels like we find them.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.856
And by way of explanation --

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.056
well, I have a compulsive habit.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.136
I play parallax and perspective games
with my eyes pretty much all the time,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.896
and it's something I've been doing
since I was a teenager.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.656
And I think the big contributing
factor may have been

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.256
that this is how I decorated
my high school bedroom.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.896
(Laughter)

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.176
And being a teenager,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.936
what I did in there, of course,
was just talk on the phone

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.136
for staggering amounts of time.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.536
So I was in this visual maelstrom

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.736
just pretty much
usually sitting in one place,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.536
and I guess just
the overload in general --

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.736
my brain kind of tried
to make sense of it, and I would --

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.256
If I could move my head off
to one side a little bit,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.616
the edge of the desk
would line up just perfectly

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.456
with that poster on the opposite wall;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.736
or if I put my thumb out,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.136
I could close first my left eye
and then my right,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.096
and my thumb would bounce back and forth

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.296
between Jimi Hendrix's
left eye and his right.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.536
(Laughter)

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.896
It was not a conscious thing, of course,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.176
this is just kind of the equivalent
of doodling while you're talking,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.296
and it's still something
I do all the time.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.656
This is my wife, Kristin --

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.856
(Applause)

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.336
Yeah!

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.560
Woo!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.896
And it's not uncommon
that we are out at dinner,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.336
and in the middle of a great conversation
she'll just stop mid-sentence,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.776
and when she stops is when I realize
that I'm the one who's acting weird

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.616
because I'm like bobbing and weaving.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.216
And what I'm trying to do
is get that ficus back there

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.216
to stick out of her head like a ponytail.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.840
(Laughter)

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.496
The point of telling you
all this is that --

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.896
for me this is what it feels like
to have an idea.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.456
It's like they're made
of these disparate parts,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.856
these disparate chunks
sort of floating out there.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.936
And if you're receptive
and you're observant,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.536
and crucially, if you're
in exactly the right place,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800
you can get them to just line up.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.696
So if you get used to --

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.256
if it's your job
to think of ideas this way,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.536
they'll start beckoning to you

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.976
the way that Jimi's eyes
beckoned from that poster,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.616
or the ficus beckons
from behind Kristin's head.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.616
Writing music feels like that process
just over and over again,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.016
like you've got a bunch of sounds
or a groove or a chord progression

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.736
and you're just looking
for that thing on the other side,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.336
that little chunk over there,
that puzzle piece that clicks right in.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.696
And when it does click,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.376
it doesn't feel like you
thought up that puzzle piece,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.056
it feels like you found it --

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.440
like it was a set of relationships
that you unlocked.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.376
But with the videos in particular,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.616
we're usually looking
for this specific feeling

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.896
which is wonder.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.816
And there's always a component
of surprise to wonder,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.176
so we're not just looking for good ideas,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.920
we're looking for good ideas
that surprise us in some way.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.656
And this causes something of a problem,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.880
because ...

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.656
the process that we all use to make stuff,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.216
it actually has a very strong bias
against surprising ideas.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.896
The process I'm talking about
is the one you all know --

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.176
we all do it all the time.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.616
You think of an idea.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.776
You just sit and think
of your brilliant idea

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.376
and then you come up with a plan

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.576
for how you're going to make
that idea happen.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.176
And then with that plan in mind,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.416
you go back and double-check
your original idea

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.696
and maybe revise it,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.696
and then bouncing back and forth
between the idea and the plan,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.936
the plan and the idea,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.176
eventually you come up
with a truly great plan.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.256
And then once you have that,
and only then,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.416
do you go out and you execute.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.096
And this is like --

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.416
this is sort of a flawless system

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.416
in terms of maximizing your resources,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.320
because this -- super cheap.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.296
Thinking usually costs very little,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.496
but this is really expensive
most of the time,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.936
so by the time you get there,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.016
you want to make sure
you're super prepared

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.856
and you can squeeze every last drop
out of what you've got.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.496
But there are problems with this,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.080
and math will help us
reveal the biggest one.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.416
Go back to that video
that we just showed you.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.176
That Rube Goldberg machine,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.496
it had about 130 interactions in it.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.200
That was 130 things

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.015
that we had to have go
according to our plan.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.896
So let's assume that we want
to make a new video now,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.960
similarly complex -- 130 moving parts.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.336
If we're really good planners
in that system,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.616
it seems like maybe
we could be good enough

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.840
to get every part of that system
to be 90 percent reliable.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.776
90 percent sounds good, right?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.056
Well, it's not.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.376
It's terrible actually.
The numbers say so.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.136
The chance of getting all 130 things
to not fail at the same time

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.416
is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.336
So calculate that out and you get ...

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.896
(Ding)

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.496
.000001,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.976
which is one ten-thousandth
of one percent,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.776
so your chance for success
is literally one in a million.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.416
(Whistle)

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.136
(Laughter)

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.616
I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.616
so let's ratchet up
that reliability to 99 percent.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.496
.99 to the 130th power is ...

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.656
(Ding)

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.616
.27 -- 27 percent.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.216
Significantly less daunting --

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.736
like this might even be usable.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.136
But really think about that.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.496
How many parts of your lives
are 99 percent reliable?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.640
And could you really get 130 of them
all in one place at once?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.640
And if you really could,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.976
doesn't it seem
like you deserve to succeed?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.496
Like that is --

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.216
that thing is going to work, right?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.656
But no, it actually fails three times
more often than it succeeds.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.376
So the upshot of all this

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.616
is that if your project
is pretty complex --

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.736
like, you know,
every ambitious project is --

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.496
if you've got a lot of moving parts,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.136
you're basically constrained
to just reshuffling ideas

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.360
that have already demonstrably
proven that they're 100 percent reliable.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.536
So now go back to me sitting
with my thumb in the air

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.616
trying to line up something surprising.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.736
If the only things I'm allowed
to consider in the first place

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.856
are ideas that have already been done
over and over and over again,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.400
I am screwed.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.736
However, there are ways around this,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.176
because we all know that there are
tons of untried ideas still out there,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.856
and plenty of them will turn out
to be every bit as reliable as we need,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.256
it's just that we don't yet know
they are reliable

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.216
when we are at this planning phase.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.936
So what we do is we try
to identify some place

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.136
where there might just be
a ton of those untried ideas.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.376
We try to find a sandbox

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.936
and then we gamble
a whole bunch of our resources

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.776
on getting in that sandbox and playing.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.416
(Laughter)

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.456
Because we have to trust
that it's the process in the sandbox

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.336
that will reveal to us
which ideas are not only surprising,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.576
but surprisingly reliable.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.240
So some of the sandboxes
that we've started videos with.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.176
Let's play with optical illusions.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.696
Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.520
Let's try to make toast
with a laser cutter.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.376
Or let's do something in one
of those zero-gravity airplanes.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.656
But then instead
of actually trying to sit there

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.496
and think out what that something is,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.456
we spent a full third of our budget
getting in an actual Vomit Comet

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.600
and bouncing off the walls for a week.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.096
So this may seem to you like testing,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.736
but it really isn't,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.696
because at this point
we don't yet know what our idea is,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.456
we don't have a plan to be testing.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.976
So we're just --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.216
we're just playing,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.376
we're just trying everything
we can think of,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.496
because we need to get this idea space
filled up with a chaos

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.656
like the one in my high school bedroom.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.616
Because then, if we can
do the bob and weave thing,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.656
if we can put our thumbs up
and get just a few things to line up --

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.896
(Ding)

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.254
chances are no one else has ever made
those same things line up before.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.096
And when we're done with that project,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.616
people will ask us again
how we thought of that idea,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.056
and we'll be stumped,
because from our perspective,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.216
it doesn't feel like
we thought of it at all,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.776
it just feels like we found it.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.976
So we'll play another video for you now
and the song along with it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.856
This is for the song "The One Moment,"

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.720
and for this one,
the sandbox was ballistics and math.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.696
So I spent a full month putting together
a giant spreadsheet for this.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.856
It was like my playspace
was 400 lines long

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.640
and 25 columns wide --

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.216
which I presume that if anybody is going
to understand that, it's this crowd.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.496
(Laughter)

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.896
Nothing is better
than a giant spreadsheet, right?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.136
(Laughter)

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.896
Well, thank you everyone, very much.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.136
We are OK Go,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.896
and this is called "The One Moment."

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.920
(Applause)

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.160
[The One Moment]

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320
(Explosions)

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.456
[What you just saw was real

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.736
and it took 4.2 seconds]

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.440
(Video) Let me know when it's safe.

00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:31.736
(Percussion)

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.336
[Here's the same moment ...

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.416
slowed down.]

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.560
(Music)

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.000
(Guitar)

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.176
(Singing) You're right,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.440
there's nothing more lovely,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.560
there's nothing more profound

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.256
than the certainty,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.800
than the certainty
that all of this will end

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.080
That all of this will end

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.536
So open your arms to me,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.256
open your arms to me

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.896
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.656
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.576
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.656
and this will be
the one moment that matters --

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.096
Oh ...

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.120
(Guitar)

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.600
(Singing) So while the mud
reclaims our footprints,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.840
and while our bones keep looking back

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.880
at the overgrowth
that's swallowing the path --

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.800
but for the grace of God go we,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.640
but for the grace of God go we

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.456
But for the grace of time and chance
and entropy's cruel hands --

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.616
So open your arms to me,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.456
open your arms to me

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.056
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.936
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.776
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.816
and this will be
the one moment that matters

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.040
Oh ...

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.696
So won't you stay here with me

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.680
and we'll build
'til we've blistered our hands

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.576
So won't you stay here with me
and we'll build us some temples,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.576
build us some castles,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.256
build us some monuments

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.976
and burn them all right down

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.040
(Music)

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.120
(Singing) So open your arms to me

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.256
And this will be
the one moment that matters,

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.176
and this will be
the reason to have been here,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.016
and this will be
the one thing we remember,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.176
and this will be
the one moment that matters

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.096
So won't you stay here with me,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.376
we'll build 'til we blister our hands

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.536
And this will be
the one moment that matters --

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.016
So won't you stay here with me
and build us some temples --

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.976
This will be the one
moment that matters --

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.576
Build us some temples --

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.456
The one moment that matters --

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.456
Build us some monuments --

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.496
The one moment that matters

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.296
Build us some temples --

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.536
The one moment that matters.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.016
Build us some monuments --

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.896
The one moment that matters, oh

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.680
(Guitar)

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.599
(Applause)
