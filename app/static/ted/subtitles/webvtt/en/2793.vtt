00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:02.197
Zika fever:

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.826
our newest dread disease.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.846
What is it? Where'd it come from?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.100
What do we do about it?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.300
Well for most adults,
it's a relatively mild disease --

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:20.625
a little fever, a little headache,
joint pain, maybe a rash.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.320
In fact, most people who get it
don't even know they've had it.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.534
But the more we find out
about the Zika virus

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.106
the more terrifying it becomes.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.637
For example, doctors
have noticed an uptick

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.375
of something called Guillain-Barré
syndrome in recent outbreaks.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.551
In Guillain-Barré, your immune system
attacks your nerve cells

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.694
it can partially
or even totally paralyze you.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:47.510
Fortunately, that's quite rare,
and most people recover.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.093
But if you're pregnant
when you're infected

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.323
you're at risk of something terrible.

00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:00.140
Indeed, a child with a deformed head.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.164
Here's a normal baby.

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:06.553
Here's that infant
with what's called microcephaly.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.733
a brain in a head that's too small.

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:11.987
And there's no known cure.

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:18.851
It was actually doctors
in northeastern Brazil

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:23.985
who first noticed, just a year ago,
after a Zika outbreak,

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.136
that there was a peak
in the incidence of microcephaly.

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:30.486
It took medical doctors another year

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.302
to be sure that it was caused
by the Zika virus,

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:34.477
but they're now sure.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.183
And if you're a "bring on
the evidence" type,

00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:38.770
check out this publication.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.704
So where did it come from,
and how did it get here?

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.037
And it is here.

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:46.973
Like many of our viruses,
it came out of Africa,

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.790
specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:56.554
Researchers at the nearby
Yellow Fever Research Institute

00:01:56.578 --> 00:02:00.864
identified an unknown virus
in a monkey in the Zika forest

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.888
which is how it got its name.

00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:05.806
The first human cases of Zika fever

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.805
surfaced a few years later
in Uganda-Tanzania.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.370
The virus then spread through West Africa

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:19.630
and east through equatorial Asia --
Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:24.336
But it was still mostly in monkeys
and, of course, mosquitoes.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:31.670
In fact in the 60 years between the time
it was first identified in 1947 and 2007

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:35.297
there were only 13 reported cases
of human Zika fever.

00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:41.676
And then something extraordinary happened
on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.985
There was an outbreak that affected
fully 75 percent of the population.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.635
How did it get there? By air.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.316
Today we have two billion
commercial airline passengers.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.583
An infected passenger can board a plane,
fly halfway around the world

00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:03.138
before developing symptoms --
if they develop symptoms at all.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.179
Then when they land, the local mosquitoes
begin to bite them and spread the fever.

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:14.966
Zika fever then next surfaced
in 2013 in French Polynesia.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.624
By December of that year, it was being
transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:26.014
That led to an explosive outbreak in which
almost 30,000 people were affected.

00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:28.768
From there it radiated around the Pacific.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:33.315
There were outbreaks in the Cook
Islands, in New Caledonia,

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:36.124
in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:41.036
and almost all the way around to the coast
of South America and Easter Island.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.512
And then, in early 2015,

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:48.901
there was an upsurge of cases
of a dengue-like syndrome

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:52.821
in the city of Natal
in northeastern Brazil.

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:58.733
The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika,
and it spread rapidly --

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:04.797
Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan
center, soon became the epicenter.

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:11.017
Well people have speculated that it was
2014 World Cup soccer fans

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.090
that brought the virus into the country.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.911
But others have speculated that perhaps
it was Pacific Islanders

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.594
participating in championship canoe races

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:23.046
that were held in Rio that year
that brought it in.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.449
Well today, this is only a year later.

00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:31.180
The virus is being locally transmitted
by mosquitoes

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.465
virtually throughout South America,
Central America, Mexico

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.910
and the Caribbean Islands

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.067
Until this year, the many
thousands of cases

00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.910
that have been diagnosed in the US
were contracted elsewhere.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:50.234
But as of this summer, it's being
transmitted locally in Miami.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.499
It's here.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:52.808
So what do we do about it?

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.543
Well, preventing infection

00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.892
is either about protecting people
or about eliminating the mosquitoes.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.831
Let's focus on people first.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.371
You can get vaccinated.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:11.045
You can not travel to Zika areas.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.997
Or you can cover up
and apply insect repellent.

00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:18.243
Getting vaccinated is not an option,
because there isn't a vaccine yet

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:20.647
and there probably won't be
for a couple of years.

00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:25.796
Staying home isn't
a foolproof protection either

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.835
because we now know that
it can be sexually transmitted.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.116
Covering up and applying
insect repellent does work ...

00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:35.322
until you forget.

00:05:35.822 --> 00:05:37.600
(Laughter)

00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:40.727
So that leaves the mosquitoes,
and here's how we control them now:

00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:43.060
spraying insecticides.

00:05:44.314 --> 00:05:48.180
The protective gear is necessary
because these are toxic chemicals

00:05:48.204 --> 00:05:50.805
that kill people as well as bugs.

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:54.596
Although it does take quite a lot more
to kill a person than to kill a bug.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.796
These are pictures from
Brazil and Nicaragua.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.453
But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.063
And we of course can spray
insecticides from planes.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.674
Last summer, mosquito control officials
in Dorchester County, South Carolina,

00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:17.603
authorized spraying of Naled,
an insecticide,

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.507
early one morning,
as recommended by the manufacturer.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.205
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.030
that her bee yard looked
like it had been nuked.

00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.213
Oops.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.211
Bees are the good guys.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.640
The citizens of Florida protested,
but spraying continued.

00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:45.465
Unfortunately, so did the increase
in the number of Zika fever cases.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.703
That's because insecticides
aren't very effective.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.651
So are there any approaches that are
perhaps more effective than spraying

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.893
but with less downsides
than toxic chemicals?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.821
I'm a huge fan of biological controls,

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:12.338
and I share that view with Rachel Carson,
author of "Silent Spring,"

00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:17.376
the book that is credited with starting
the environmental movement.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.956
In this book she tells the story,
as an example,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.638
of how a very nasty insect
pest of livestock

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:29.702
was eliminated in the last century.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.602
No one knows that
extraordinary story today.

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.865
So Jack Block and I,
when we were writing an editorial

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.103
about the mosquito problem today,
retold that story.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:44.793
And in capsule form, it's that pupae --
that's the immature form of the insect --

00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:49.596
were irradiated until they were sterile,
grown to adulthood

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.230
and then released from planes
all over the Southwest,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:57.667
the Southeast and down into Mexico
and into Central America

00:07:57.691 --> 00:08:01.500
literally by the hundreds of millions
from little airplanes,

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:06.333
eventually eliminating
that terrible insect pest

00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:08.760
for most of the Western Hemisphere.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.579
Our real purpose in writing this editorial

00:08:12.603 --> 00:08:15.587
was to introduce readers
to how we can do that today --

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:20.054
not with radiation
but with our knowledge of genetics.

00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:21.228
Let me explain.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.386
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.071
It's the most common insect
vector of diseases,

00:08:29.095 --> 00:08:32.889
not just Zika but dengue,
Chikungunya, West Nile virus

00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:36.547
and that ancient plague, yellow fever.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.835
It's an urban mosquito,

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:42.765
and it's the female
that does the dirty work.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:47.543
She bites to get a blood meal
to feed her offspring.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.107
Males don't bite; they don't even
have the mouth parts to bite.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:58.757
A little British company called Oxitec
genetically modified that mosquito

00:08:58.781 --> 00:09:05.126
so that when it mates with a wild female,
its eggs don't develop to adulthood.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.300
Let me show you.

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:09.181
This is the normal reproductive cycle.

00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:14.141
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that
when the male mates with the wild female

00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:16.283
the eggs don't develop.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.200
Sounds impossible?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.152
Well let me show you
just diagrammatically how they do it.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.992
Now this represents the nucleus
of a mosquito cell,

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:28.968
and that tangle in the middle
represents its genome,

00:09:28.992 --> 00:09:31.492
the sum total of its genes.

00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:34.865
Scientists added a single gene

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:39.198
that codes for a protein represented
by this orange ball

00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:44.714
that feeds back on itself
to keep cranking out more of that protein.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.993
The extra copies, however,
go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,

00:09:50.017 --> 00:09:51.295
killing the organism.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.128
To keep it alive in the laboratory
they use a compound called tetracycline.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:10:02.000
Tetracycline shuts off that gene
and allows normal development.

00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:06.357
They added another little wrinkle
so that they could study what happens.

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:13.144
And that is they added a gene
that makes the insect glow under UV light

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:16.978
so that when they released it
they could follow exactly how far it went

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.756
how long it lived
and all of the kinds of data

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.272
for a good scientific study.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.308
Now this is the pupal stage,
and at this stage

00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:30.007
the females are larger than the males.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.468
That allows them to sort them
into the males and the females

00:10:34.492 --> 00:10:39.214
and they allow only the males
to grow to adulthood.

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:41.556
And let me remind you
that males don't bite.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.176
From there it's pretty simple.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.802
They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:49.406
load them into milk cartons,
and drive around the city,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.017
releasing them guided by GPS.

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:55.375
Here's the mayor of a city
releasing the first batch

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.386
of what they call the "friendly Aedes."

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.671
Now I wish I could tell you
this is an American city, but it's not.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.639
It's Piracicaba, Brazil.

00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.964
The amazing thing is that in just a year

00:11:08.988 --> 00:11:13.996
it brought down the cases
of dengue by 91 percent.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.530
That's better than any insecticide
spraying can do.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.926
So why aren't we using this remarkable
biological control in the US?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:30.876
That's because it's a GMO:
a genetically modified organism.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.534
Notice the subtitle here says
if the FDA would let them

00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:38.546
they could do the same thing here,
when Zika arrives.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.308
And of course it has arrived.

00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:44.316
So now I have to tell you the short form

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:50.109
of the long, torturous story
of GM regulation in the US

00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:57.506
In the US, there are three agencies that
regulate genetically modified organisms:

00:11:58.165 --> 00:12:00.656
the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.902
the EPA, the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:05.799
and the USDA, US Department
of Agriculture.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.313
Took these folks two years
to decide that it would be the FDA

00:12:11.337 --> 00:12:14.240
that would regulate the genetically
modified mosquito.

00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:20.748
And they would do it as a new animal drug,
if that makes any sense.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.841
Took them another five years going back
and forth and back and forth

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:30.252
to convince the FDA
that this would not harm people,

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:33.256
and it would not harm the environment.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.607
They finally gave them, this summer,
permission to run a little test

00:12:38.631 --> 00:12:40.170
in the Florida Keys,

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:46.678
where they had been invited years earlier
when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.

00:12:47.784 --> 00:12:49.815
Would that it were that easy.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.556
When the local residents heard

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.675
that there would be genetically modified
mosquitoes tested in their community

00:12:56.699 --> 00:12:59.524
some of them began to organize protests.

00:12:59.548 --> 00:13:04.587
They even organized a petition on
the internet with this cuddly logo,

00:13:05.143 --> 00:13:11.380
which eventually accumulated
some 160,000 signatures

00:13:11.404 --> 00:13:13.086
And they demanded a referendum

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.982
which will be conducted
in just a couple of weeks

00:13:16.006 --> 00:13:19.109
about whether the trials
would be permitted at all.

00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:26.712
Well it's Miami that really needs
these better ways of controlling insects.

00:13:26.736 --> 00:13:28.877
And there the attitudes are changing.

00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:34.916
In fact, very recently a bipartisan group
of more than 60 legislators

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.122
wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell

00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:43.490
asking that she, at the Federal level,
expedite access for Florida

00:13:43.514 --> 00:13:45.598
to this new technology.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.787
So the bottom line is this:

00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:51.461
biological control of harmful insects

00:13:51.763 --> 00:13:56.675
can be both more effective and
very much more environmentally friendly

00:13:56.699 --> 00:14:01.492
than using insecticides,
which are toxic chemicals.

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:04.956
That was true in Rachel Carson's
time; it's true today.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.694
What's different is that we have
enormously more information

00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:12.615
about genetics than we had then,

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:16.773
and therefore more ability
to use that information

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.559
to affect these biological controls.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.368
And I hope that what I've done
is aroused your curiosity enough

00:14:25.392 --> 00:14:30.676
to start your own inquiry --
not into just GM mosquitoes

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:37.104
but to the other genetically modified
organisms that are so controversial today.

00:14:37.747 --> 00:14:42.444
I think if you do that, and you dig down
through all of the misinformation,

00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:43.778
and the marketing

00:14:43.802 --> 00:14:47.190
on the part of the organic food industry
and the Greenpeaces

00:14:47.214 --> 00:14:50.364
and find the science,
the accurate science,

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:52.698
you'll be surprised and pleased.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.270
Thank you.

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:56.294
(Applause)
