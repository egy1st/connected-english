00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:05.181
"When I become famous,
I will tell everyone

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.339
that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:09.938
Heroes rarely look like me.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.034
In fact,

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:13.738
I'm what garbage looks like.

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:17.146
No, not the most appealing
way to open a talk

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.867
or start a conversation,

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:22.364
and perhaps you have some questions
going through your head about that.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.762
Why would this man say
such a thing about himself?

00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:26.259
What does he mean?

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:30.469
How can someone view him as a hero
when he sees himself as garbage?

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:34.336
I believe we learn more from questions
than we do from answers.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.643
Because when we're questioning something,

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.001
we're invested in taking in
some sort of new information,

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:44.262
or grappling with some sort of ignorance
that makes us feel uncomfortable.

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:45.992
And that's why I'm here:

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.551
to push us to question,

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.650
even when it makes us uncomfortable.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.212
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.449
the southernmost island in the Caribbean.

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.451
Trinidad is also home
to the only acoustic instrument

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.345
invented in the 20th century:

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.652
the steel pan.

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:04.711
Deriving from the African drums

00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:08.012
and evolving from the genius
of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:09.722
a city called Laventille,

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:12.722
and the disregard
of the American military ...

00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:14.833
Well, I should tell you,

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:18.224
America, during WWII, had
military bases set up in Trinidad,

00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:19.669
and when the war ended,

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:23.229
they left the island littered
with empty oil drums --

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:24.498
their trash.

00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:29.231
So people from Laventille
repurposed the old drums left behind

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.458
into the full chromatic scale:

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:32.690
the steel pan.

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:37.471
Playing music now from Beethoven
to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:41.733
those people literally made
music out of garbage.

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:45.253
Twelve days before my 20th birthday,

00:01:45.277 --> 00:01:49.148
I was arrested for my role
in a violent robbery attempt

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:50.384
in lower Manhattan.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.197
While people were sitting
in a coffee shop,

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:55.719
four people were shot.

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:58.699
Two were killed.

00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:01.125
Five of us were arrested.

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:04.851
We were all the products
of Trinidad and Tobago.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.784
We were the "bad immigrants,"

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:10.844
or the "anchor babies" that Trump
and millions of Americans easily malign.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.961
I was discarded, like waste material --

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:17.189
and justifiably so to many.

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:21.222
I eventually served 10 years, two months
and seven days of a prison sentence.

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:27.102
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment
in a correctional institution.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:30.510
I was sentenced to irrelevance --

00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:32.177
the opposite of humanity.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.810
Interestingly,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:39.857
it was during those years in prison
that a series of letters redeemed me,

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.720
helped me move beyond
the darkness and the guilt

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:45.632
associated with the worst
moment of my young life.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.055
It gave me a sense that I was useful.

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:50.922
She was 13 years old.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.884
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.

00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:55.886
I remember reading that,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.637
and I remember crying
when I read those words.

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:01.858
She was one of over 50 students

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.932
and 150 letters that I wrote during
a mentoring correspondence program

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.566
that I co-designed with a friend

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.920
who was a teacher
at a middle school in Brooklyn,

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:11.100
my hometown.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.180
We called it the Young Scholars Program.

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.595
Every time those young people
shared their stories with me,

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.226
their struggles,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.023
every time they drew a picture
of their favorite cartoon character

00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:24.482
and sent it to me,

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:28.876
every time they said they depended
on my letters or my words of advice,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.799
it boosted my sense of worthiness.

00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.916
It gave me a sense of what
I could contribute to this planet.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:36.953
It transformed my life.

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:40.446
Because of those letters
and what they shared with me,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.335
their stories of teen life,

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.429
they gave me the permission,

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.869
they gave me the courage
to admit to myself

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.696
that there were reasons -- not excuses --

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.133
but that there were reasons
for that fateful day in October of 1999;

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:57.439
that the trauma associated
with living in a community

00:03:57.463 --> 00:03:59.637
where guns are easier
to get than sneakers;

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:06.811
that the trauma associated with being
raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;

00:04:07.607 --> 00:04:10.304
that those are reasons for me

00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:12.118
why making that decision,

00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:13.307
that fatal decision,

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.295
was not an unlikely proposition.

00:04:16.192 --> 00:04:18.899
Because those letters
mattered so much to me,

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.331
because writing and receiving

00:04:20.355 --> 00:04:22.612
and having that communication
with those folks

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.135
so hugely impacted my life,

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.041
I decided to share the opportunity
with some friends of mine

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:28.461
who were also inside with me.

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.442
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,

00:04:30.466 --> 00:04:32.690
all in prison for violent crimes also,

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:35.518
shared their words of wisdom
with the young people as well,

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.803
and received the sense
of relevancy in return.

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:41.508
We are now published writers
and youth program innovators

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.281
and trauma experts

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.174
and gun violence prevention advocates,

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:46.576
and TED talkers and --

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.626
(Laughter)

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.104
and good daddies.

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:51.943
That's what I call a positive
return of investment.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.900
Above all else,

00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:57.827
what building that program
taught me was that when we sow,

00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.613
when we invest in the humanity
of people no matter where they're at,

00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:04.102
we can reap amazing rewards.

00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.326
In this latest era
of criminal justice reform,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.274
I often question and wonder why --

00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:12.525
why is it that so many believe

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:16.015
that only those who have been convicted
of nonviolent drug offenses

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.849
merit empathy and recognized humanity?

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:23.565
Criminal justice reform is human justice.

00:05:23.993 --> 00:05:25.468
Am I not human?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.358
When we invest in resources
that amplify the relevancy of people

00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:32.852
in communities like Laventille

00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:35.025
or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:37.721
we can literally create
the communities that we want.

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:39.603
We can do better.

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:43.215
We can do better than investing solely
in law enforcement as a resource,

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:46.136
because they don't give us
a sense of relevancy

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.710
that is at the core of why so many of us
do so many harmful things

00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.406
in the pursuit of mattering.

00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:57.405
See, gun violence is just a visible
display of a lot of underlying traumas.

00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:01.475
When we invest in the redemptive
value of relevancy,

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:05.891
we can render a return of both
personal responsibility and healing.

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:08.548
That's the people work I care about,

00:06:08.572 --> 00:06:10.004
because people work.

00:06:11.313 --> 00:06:15.241
Family, I'm asking you
to do the hard work,

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:16.713
the difficult work,

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.672
the churning work of bestowing
undeserved kindness

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:22.143
upon those who we can relegate as garbage,

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.335
who we can disregard and discard easily.

00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:26.349
I'm asking myself.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.430
Over the past two months,

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:31.548
I've lost two friends to gun violence,

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.839
both innocent bystanders.

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:38.015
One was caught in a drive-by
while walking home.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.213
The other was sitting in a café
while eating breakfast,

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:43.938
while on vacation in Miami.

00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:49.093
I'm asking myself to see
the redemptive value of relevancy

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.819
in the people that murdered them,

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.194
because of the hard work
of seeing the value in me.

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:58.985
I'm pushing us to challenge
our own capacity

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.374
to fully experience our humanity,

00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:03.387
by understanding the full biography

00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:06.456
of people who we can
easily choose not to see,

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:11.125
because heroes are waiting
to be recognized,

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:12.985
and music is waiting to be made.

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:15.104
Thank you.

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:19.066
(Applause)
