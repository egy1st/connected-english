00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:18.077

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.165

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.508
All the way to the jail, boy --

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:05.062
(Guitar strum)

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:08.907

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:09.968

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:13.343

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:18.830

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.667

You done robbed my pocket,

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.117

00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:48.824
of silver and gold.

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.627
Water Boy,

00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:59.588

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:04.457

00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:34.195
I'm gonna bust this rock, boy,

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.460
from here to Macon.

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:43.958
All the way to the jail, boy,

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:47.889
all the way to the jail.

00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:55.635
Water

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.319
Boy

00:02:58.343 --> 00:02:59.374
(Guitar strum)

00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:03.719
where are you hidin'?

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:04.750

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.774

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:15.911
I'm gonna tell

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:19.384
your pa

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:23.141
on you.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.208
(Guitar strum)

00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:26.309
(Applause)

00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:35.304
Thank you.

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:41.379
That was a song based on
numerous work songs,

00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:43.442
and it was arranged by Odetta,

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.695
a hero of mine.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.817
And this next song, well,

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.021
I do a lot of historical music,

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:52.067
starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.317
and continuing on in my solo endeavors.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.000
And I believe that knowing
your history as a musician

00:03:58.024 --> 00:03:59.224
is super important --

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:00.853
it's important as a person,

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:02.385
it's important as a country,

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.799
it's important as a people.

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:06.894
So I read a lot about where
the music comes from

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:08.539
and where this country comes from.

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:10.687
I've been reading a lot
about the Civil War

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:11.895
and about slavery.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.546
And it's really tough.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.724
You know?

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:16.000
It's really tough reading.

00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:18.544
And so as an artist,
what I do with all that emotion,

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:20.158
reading these people's stories,

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:21.991
not just, "Oh, slavery was terrible."

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.321
Yes, it was.

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:28.273
But it's reading individual narratives
of how it was for these people.

00:04:28.297 --> 00:04:29.456
You know?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.812
Then it's like, "Yeah,
that could've been me."

00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.530
And it is people now. You know?

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:35.293
So what you do with all that emotion

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.150
is you've got to do something with it.

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.327
As an artist, I write.

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.470
So I wrote a song based on
some of those narratives that I read,

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:43.561
and it's called, "Come Love Come."

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.621
We're going to do it for you now.

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:53.241
(Claps)

00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:56.704
(Sings) Come love come,

00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:58.288
the road lies low,

00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:01.556
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.090
Come love come,

00:05:03.114 --> 00:05:05.004
the road lies free,

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:08.026
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.921
(Music)

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.005
(Sings) When I was four,

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.879
my loving mam was cornered
by the boss's man.

00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:31.197
She turned her head and got struck down,

00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:34.503
they buried her in the cold, cold ground.

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:36.107
Come love come,

00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:37.893
the road lies low,

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:41.074
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:42.856
Come love come,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.468
the road lies free,

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:47.389
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.750
(Music)

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.663
When I was 12,

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.396
my father dear

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.816
was strong of arm and free of fear

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.965
until the day he raised his hand,

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:07.187
then he was sold to Alabama.

00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:09.067
Come love come,

00:06:09.091 --> 00:06:10.906
the road lies low,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.050
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.615
Come love come,

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.398
the road lies free,

00:06:17.422 --> 00:06:20.540
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:06:20.564 --> 00:06:22.461
(Music)

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:36.766
When I was 16, found my bloom

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.248
and found my man,

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:39.818
we jumped the broom.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:42.896
We pledged each other
the rest of our lives

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.333
and on Saturday nights
we were man and wife.

00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:48.013
Come love come,

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:49.675
the road lies low,

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.408
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:54.501
Come love come,

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:56.117
the road lies free,

00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.897
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.800
(Music)

00:07:12.088 --> 00:07:13.735
When I was 18,

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.332
bugles called

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:18.490
and boys in blue came o'er the wall.

00:07:18.514 --> 00:07:21.702
I took my chance and followed free,

00:07:21.726 --> 00:07:24.535
they led the way to Tennessee.

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.770
Come love come,

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.446
the road lies low,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.215
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:07:31.623 --> 00:07:33.290
Come love come,

00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:34.937
the road lies free,

00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:38.184
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:40.845
(Music)

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:53.739
Now here I sit in a tiny shack

00:07:53.763 --> 00:07:56.902
with 13 others at my back.

00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:58.497
I've sent you word,

00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.115
so all I can do

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.264
is wait and wait and wait and wait

00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:08.079
and wait

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:11.342
and wait for you.

00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:14.526
Come love come,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.156
the road lies low,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.828
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:08:19.268 --> 00:08:20.836
Come love come,

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.552
the road lies free,

00:08:22.576 --> 00:08:25.679
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:08:25.703 --> 00:08:27.357
Come love come,

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.933
the road lies low,

00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:32.156
the way is long and hard, I know.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.760
Come love come,

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.404
the road lies free,

00:08:35.428 --> 00:08:42.030
I'll wait for you in Tennessee.

00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:51.534
Oh,

00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:57.490
oh,

00:08:57.514 --> 00:09:00.372
oh.

00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:05.791
Whoa ... oh I'll wait for you.

00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.729
I'll wait for you.

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:15.201
I'll wait for you

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:17.106
I'll wait for you.

00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:21.418
(Applause)

00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:32.655
Thank you.

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:36.542
So, with the dark
you have to have the light.

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:39.108
And in the African-American community,

00:09:39.132 --> 00:09:41.353
it's been the work of many
hundreds of years

00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:43.463
to find a way to lift ourselves up.

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:47.750
So I'm going to end with a couple
of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:50.785
one of the more influential
American music figures

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:52.835
that most of you probably never heard of.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.975
If you have, I'm so happy.

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:57.463
She's one of the innovators
of rock 'n' roll guitar,

00:09:57.487 --> 00:10:01.116
and one of the first crossover artists
from gospel to secular.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.914
She's an incredibly important figure,

00:10:02.938 --> 00:10:05.131
and I'm going to talk about her
whenever I can.

00:10:05.155 --> 00:10:06.822
So these are a couple of her tunes.

00:10:06.846 --> 00:10:09.855
And don't worry -- you're going to get
your chance to sing.

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:11.948
(Music)

00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.097
(Sings) Look down, look down

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.769
that lonesome road

00:10:24.793 --> 00:10:28.422
before you travel on.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.745
Look up, look up

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:34.586
and greet your maker,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.360
for Gabriel blows his horn.

00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:44.399
Weary totin' such a load,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.180
goin' down that lonesome road.

00:10:49.204 --> 00:10:54.375
Look down that lonesome road,

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:58.254
before you travel on.

00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:01.452
Look down, look down

00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:03.997
that lonesome road

00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:07.549
before you travel on.

00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:10.889
Look up, look up

00:11:10.913 --> 00:11:13.557
and greet your maker,

00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:17.517
for Gabriel blows his horn.

00:11:19.215 --> 00:11:23.091
Weary totin' such a load,

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:27.771
goin' down that lonesome road.

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:30.624
Look down, look down, look down, look down

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.711
that lonesome road

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:36.643
before you travel on.

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:37.950
Up above my head

00:11:37.974 --> 00:11:39.178
up above my head
