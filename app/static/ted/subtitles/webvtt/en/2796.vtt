00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.419
So, imagine that you had
your smartphone miniaturized

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:06.803
and hooked up directly to your brain.

00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.604
If you had this sort of brain chip,

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:12.159
you'd be able to upload
and download to the internet

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:13.375
at the speed of thought.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:17.253
Accessing social media or Wikipedia
would be a lot like --

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:18.917
well, from the inside at least --

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.691
like consulting your own memory.

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:24.445
It would be as easy
and as intimate as thinking.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.736
But would it make it easier
for you to know what's true?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.721
Just because a way
of accessing information is faster

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.990
it doesn't mean it's more
reliable, of course,

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:37.245
and it doesn't mean that we would all
interpret it the same way.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.863
And it doesn't mean that you would be
any better at evaluating it.

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:42.544
In fact, you might even be worse,

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:45.350
because, you know, more data,
less time for evaluation.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.773
Something like this is already
happening to us right now.

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:53.655
We already carry a world of information
around in our pockets,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.908
but it seems as if the more information
we share and access online,

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.734
the more difficult it can be for us
to tell the difference

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:02.875
between what's real and what's fake.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:07.445
It's as if we know more
but understand less.

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:11.089
Now, it's a feature
of modern life, I suppose,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:15.101
that large swaths of the public
live in isolated information bubbles.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.503
We're polarized: not just over values,
but over the facts.

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:24.124
One reason for that is, the data
analytics that drive the internet

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:26.547
get us not just more information,

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.757
but more of the information that we want.

00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:31.171
Our online life is personalized;

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.925
everything from the ads we read

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:35.539
to the news that comes down
our Facebook feed

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:38.569
is tailored to satisfy our preferences.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.085
And so while we get more information,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.339
a lot of that information ends up
reflecting ourselves

00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.567
as much as it does reality.

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:48.837
It ends up, I suppose,

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.224
inflating our bubbles
rather than bursting them.

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:55.460
And so maybe it's no surprise

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.389
that we're in a situation,
a paradoxical situation,

00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:00.544
of thinking that we know so much more,

00:02:00.568 --> 00:02:03.578
and yet not agreeing
on what it is we know.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.831
So how are we going to solve
this problem of knowledge polarization?

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:13.023
One obvious tactic is to try
to fix our technology,

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.956
to redesign our digital platforms,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.123
so as to make them less
susceptible to polarization.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.083
And I'm happy to report

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:24.747
that many smart people at Google
and Facebook are working on just that.

00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:26.360
And these projects are vital.

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:30.967
I think that fixing technology
is obviously really important,

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.613
but I don't think technology alone,
fixing it, is going to solve the problem

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:36.991
of knowledge polarization.

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:40.090
I don't think that because I don't think,
at the end of the day,

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:41.743
it is a technological problem.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.642
I think it's a human problem,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:47.231
having to do with how we think
and what we value.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.900
In order to solve it, I think
we're going to need help.

00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:53.929
We're going to need help
from psychology and political science.

00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:57.203
But we're also going to need help,
I think, from philosophy.

00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:02.191
Because to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization,

00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:05.517
we're going to need to reconnect

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:10.291
with one fundamental, philosophical idea:

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.616
that we live in a common reality.

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.698
The idea of a common reality
is like, I suppose,

00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:20.285
a lot of philosophical concepts:

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:21.475
easy to state

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.134
but mysteriously difficult
to put into practice.

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:26.308
To really accept it,

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:28.549
I think we need to do three things,

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:30.885
each of which is a challenge right now.

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.313
First, we need to believe in truth.

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.430
You might have noticed

00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:40.469
that our culture is having
something of a troubled relationship

00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:41.894
with that concept right now.

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.274
It seems as if we disagree so much that,

00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:49.107
as one political commentator
put it not long ago,

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.366
it's as if there are no facts anymore.

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:57.208
But that thought is actually an expression

00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:01.241
of a sort of seductive line
of argument that's in the air.

00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:02.936
It goes like this:

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:07.039
we just can't step outside
of our own perspectives;

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.505
we can't step outside of our biases.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:11.002
Every time we try,

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:14.611
we just get more information
from our perspective.

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.786
So, this line of thought goes,

00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:22.778
we might as well admit
that objective truth is an illusion,

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:23.956
or it doesn't matter,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.126
because either we'll never
know what it is,

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.182
or it doesn't exist in the first place.

00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:34.169
That's not a new philosophical thought --

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.041
skepticism about truth.

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.213
During the end of the last century,
as some of you know,

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:42.531
it was very popular in certain
academic circles.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:48.450
But it really goes back all the way
to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:49.800
if not farther back.

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:52.701
Protagoras said that objective
truth was an illusion

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.632
because "man is the measure
of all things."

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:57.596
Man is the measure of all things.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.992
That can seem like a bracing bit
of realpolitik to people,

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:02.175
or liberating,

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.737
because it allows each of us
to discover or make our own truth.

00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:12.780
But actually, I think it's a bit
of self-serving rationalization

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:14.671
disguised as philosophy.

00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:18.315
It confuses the difficulty
of being certain

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.984
with the impossibility of truth.

00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:23.429
Look --

00:05:24.768 --> 00:05:27.708
of course it's difficult
to be certain about anything;

00:05:28.908 --> 00:05:31.221
we might all be living in "The Matrix."

00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:34.000
You might have a brain chip in your head

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:35.988
feeding you all the wrong information.

00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:41.772
But in practice, we do agree
on all sorts of facts.

00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:45.035
We agree that bullets can kill people.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:49.999
We agree that you can't flap
your arms and fly.

00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:52.132
We agree -- or we should --

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:55.315
that there is an external reality

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.420
and ignoring it can get you hurt.

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:03.354
Nonetheless, skepticism
about truth can be tempting,

00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:06.692
because it allows us to rationalize
away our own biases.

00:06:06.716 --> 00:06:09.703
When we do that, we're sort of like
the guy in the movie

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:12.065
who knew he was living in "The Matrix"

00:06:12.793 --> 00:06:15.518
but decided he liked it there, anyway.

00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.689
After all, getting what you
want feels good.

00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.967
Being right all the time feels good.

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.773
So, often it's easier for us

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:29.286
to wrap ourselves in our cozy
information bubbles,

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.590
live in bad faith,

00:06:31.614 --> 00:06:35.365
and take those bubbles
as the measure of reality.

00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:42.440
An example, I think, of how
this bad faith gets into our action

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:47.249
is our reaction
to the phenomenon of fake news.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.804
The fake news that spread on the internet

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:55.482
during the American
presidential election of 2016

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.133
was designed to feed into our biases,

00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:00.271
designed to inflate our bubbles.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.346
But what was really striking about it

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.984
was not just that it fooled
so many people.

00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:08.436
What was really striking to me
about fake news,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.798
the phenomenon,

00:07:09.822 --> 00:07:14.877
is how quickly it itself became
the subject of knowledge polarization;

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:19.261
so much so, that the very term --
the very term -- "fake news"

00:07:19.285 --> 00:07:22.689
now just means: "news story I don't like."

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:28.240
That's an example of the bad faith
towards the truth that I'm talking about.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.714
But the really, I think, dangerous thing

00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:38.559
about skepticism with regard to truth

00:07:39.476 --> 00:07:41.383
is that it leads to despotism.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.273
"Man is the measure of all things"

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:49.214
inevitably becomes "The Man
is the measure of all things."

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.502
Just as "every man for himself"

00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:55.521
always seems to turn out to be
"only the strong survive."

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:58.834
At the end of Orwell's "1984,"

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:04.395
the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing
the protagonist Winston Smith

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.617
into believing two plus two equals five.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.375
What O'Brien says is the point,

00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:17.907
is that he wants to convince Smith
that whatever the party says is the truth,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.816
and the truth is whatever the party says.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:25.004
And what O'Brien knows
is that once this thought is accepted,

00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:28.941
critical dissent is impossible.

00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:32.045
You can't speak truth to power

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:35.224
if the power speaks truth by definition.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.123
I said that in order to accept
that we really live in a common reality,

00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:42.434
we have to do three things.

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:44.443
The first thing is to believe in truth.

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:46.137
The second thing can be summed up

00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:51.247
by the Latin phrase that Kant took
as the motto for the Enlightenment:

00:08:51.271 --> 00:08:52.908
"Sapere aude,"

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.664
or "dare to know."

00:08:54.688 --> 00:08:57.114
Or as Kant wants,
"to dare to know for yourself."

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:00.250
I think in the early days of the internet,

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:01.440
a lot of us thought

00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:05.274
that information technology
was always going to make it easier

00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:07.153
for us to know for ourselves,

00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:09.869
and of course in many ways, it has.

00:09:09.893 --> 00:09:13.731
But as the internet has become
more and more a part of our lives,

00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.714
our reliance on it, our use of it,

00:09:15.738 --> 00:09:18.298
has become often more passive.

00:09:18.322 --> 00:09:20.687
Much of what we know today we Google-know.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:24.994
We download prepackaged sets of facts

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:28.830
and sort of shuffle them along
the assembly line of social media.

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:30.787
Now, Google-knowing is useful

00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:34.007
precisely because it involves
a sort of intellectual outsourcing.

00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:39.796
We offload our effort onto a network
of others and algorithms.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.827
And that allows us, of course,
to not clutter our minds

00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:44.290
with all sorts of facts.

00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:46.601
We can just download them
when we need them.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.007
And that's awesome.

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:54.129
But there's a difference
between downloading a set of facts

00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:59.635
and really understanding how or why
those facts are as they are.

00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:05.611
Understanding why
a particular disease spreads,

00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:07.694
or how a mathematical proof works,

00:10:07.718 --> 00:10:09.731
or why your friend is depressed,

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:12.220
involves more than just downloading.

00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:15.477
It's going to require, most likely,

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.603
doing some work for yourself:

00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:20.343
having a little creative insight;

00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:21.633
using your imagination;

00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:22.975
getting out into the field;

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:24.181
doing the experiment;

00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:25.476
working through the proof;

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.944
talking to someone.

00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:35.077
Now, I'm not saying, of course,
that we should stop Google-knowing.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:37.553
I'm just saying

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:39.263
we shouldn't overvalue it, either.

00:10:39.287 --> 00:10:43.951
We need to find ways of encouraging
forms of knowing that are more active,

00:10:44.512 --> 00:10:49.561
and don't always involve passing off
our effort into our bubble.

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:53.583
Because the thing about Google-knowing
is that too often it ends up

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:54.971
being bubble-knowing.

00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.371
And bubble-knowing means
always being right.

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:01.380
But daring to know,

00:11:01.404 --> 00:11:02.974
daring to understand,

00:11:04.151 --> 00:11:07.217
means risking the possibility
that you could be wrong.

00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:10.189
It means risking the possibility

00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:14.540
that what you want and what's true
are different things.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.991
Which brings me to the third thing
that I think we need to do

00:11:19.854 --> 00:11:22.886
if we want to accept that we live
in a common reality.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.801
That third thing is:
have a little humility.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.632
By humility here, I mean
epistemic humility,

00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:30.645
which means, in a sense,

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:34.104
knowing that you don't know it all.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.181
But it also means something
more than that.

00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:40.655
It means seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.810
by the evidence and experience of others.

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:44.883
Seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:47.030
by the evidence and experience of others.

00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:50.123
That's more than just
being open to change.

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:52.545
It's more than just being open
to self-improvement.

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:56.854
It means seeing your knowledge
as capable of enhancing

00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:59.404
or being enriched
by what others contribute.

00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:02.938
That's part of what is involved

00:12:02.962 --> 00:12:05.095
in recognizing there's a common reality

00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:07.969
that you, too, are responsible to.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:11.838
I don't think it's much
of a stretch to say

00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:16.817
that our society is not particularly great
at enhancing or encouraging

00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:18.056
that sort of humility.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.659
That's partly because,

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.798
well, we tend to confuse
arrogance and confidence.

00:12:24.263 --> 00:12:26.704
And it's partly because, well, you know,

00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.894
arrogance is just easier.

00:12:28.918 --> 00:12:31.595
It's just easier to think of yourself
as knowing it all.

00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:35.316
It's just easier to think of yourself
as having it all figured out.

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:39.446
But that's another example
of the bad faith towards the truth

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.008
that I've been talking about.

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:45.628
So the concept of a common reality,

00:12:45.652 --> 00:12:48.342
like a lot of philosophical concepts,

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:49.850
can seem so obvious,

00:12:50.785 --> 00:12:52.627
that we can look right past it

00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:55.929
and forget why it's important.

00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:02.338
Democracies can't function
if their citizens don't strive,

00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:03.732
at least some of the time,

00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:05.437
to inhabit a common space,

00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:08.917
a space where they can pass
ideas back and forth

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.909
when -- and especially when --

00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:13.338
they disagree.

00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:16.013
But you can't strive to inhabit that space

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.146
if you don't already accept
that you live in the same reality.

00:13:23.144 --> 00:13:25.315
To accept that, we've got
to believe in truth,

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:28.650
we've got to encourage
more active ways of knowing.

00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:31.132
And we've got to have the humility

00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:34.978
to realize that we're not
the measure of all things.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:40.573
We may yet one day realize the vision

00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:43.270
of having the internet in our brains.

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:48.464
But if we want that to be liberating
and not terrifying,

00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:51.250
if we want it to expand our understanding

00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:53.677
and not just our passive knowing,

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:58.224
we need to remember that our perspectives,

00:13:58.248 --> 00:14:01.399
as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,

00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:03.451
are just that --

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:05.995
perspectives on one reality.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.367
Thank you.

00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:13.217
(Applause)
