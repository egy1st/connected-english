00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.416
Imagine that when you walked
in here this evening,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.520
you discovered that everybody in the room
looked almost exactly the same:

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.216
ageless, raceless,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.480
generically good-looking.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.256
That person sitting right next to you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.416
might have the most
idiosyncratic inner life,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.696
but you don't have a clue

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.280
because we're all wearing
the same blank expression all the time.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.320
That is the kind of creepy transformation
that is taking over cities,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.960
only it applies to buildings, not people.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.456
Cities are full of roughness and shadow,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.696
texture and color.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.880
You can still find architectural surfaces
of great individuality and character

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280
in apartment buildings in Riga

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.280
and Yemen,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040
social housing in Vienna,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.376
Hopi villages in Arizona,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.840
brownstones in New York,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.120
wooden houses in San Francisco.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.680
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.856
These are just ordinary residences

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.440
expressing the ordinary
splendor of cities.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.776
And the reason they're like that
is that the need for shelter

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.880
is so bound up with
the human desire for beauty.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.320
Their rough surfaces
give us a touchable city.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.416
Right? Streets that you can read

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.560
by running your fingers
over brick and stone.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.280
But that's getting harder to do,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440
because cities are becoming smooth.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.736
New downtowns sprout towers

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.096
that are almost always
made of concrete and steel

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.480
and covered in glass.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.776
You can look at skylines
all over the world --

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.000
Houston,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.840
Guangzhou,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.640
Frankfurt --

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.856
and you see the same army
of high-gloss robots

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160
marching over the horizon.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.696
Now, just think of everything we lose

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.960
when architects stop using
the full range of available materials.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.536
When we reject granite
and limestone and sandstone

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.736
and wood and copper
and terra-cotta and brick

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.280
and wattle and plaster,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.256
we simplify architecture

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.840
and we impoverish cities.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.576
It's as if you reduced
all of the world's cuisines

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.536
down to airline food.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.616
(Laughter)

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.840
Chicken or pasta?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.760
But worse still,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.336
assemblies of glass towers
like this one in Moscow

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.256
suggest a disdain for the civic
and communal aspects of urban living.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.336
Right? Buildings like these are intended
to enrich their owners and tenants,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.936
but not necessarily
the lives of the rest of us,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.600
those of us who navigate
the spaces between the buildings.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.480
And we expect to do so for free.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.240
Shiny towers are an invasive species

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.320
and they are choking our cities
and killing off public space.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.776
We tend to think of a facade
as being like makeup,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.562
a decorative layer applied at the end
to a building that's effectively complete.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.696
But just because a facade is superficial

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.976
doesn't mean it's not also deep.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.280
Let me give you an example

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.216
of how a city's surfaces
affect the way we live in it.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.136
When I visited Salamanca in Spain,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.416
I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.856
at all hours of the day.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.856
Early in the morning,
sunlight rakes the facades,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.576
sharpening shadows,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.896
and at night, lamplight
segments the buildings

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.760
into hundreds of distinct areas,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.896
balconies and windows and arcades,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.760
each one a separate pocket
of visual activity.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320
That detail and depth, that glamour

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.040
gives the plaza a theatrical quality.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.400
It becomes a stage
where the generations can meet.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.536
You have teenagers
sprawling on the pavers,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.376
seniors monopolizing the benches,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.296
and real life starts to look
like an opera set.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.080
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.600
So just because I'm talking
about the exteriors of buildings,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.520
not form, not function, not structure,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.160
even so those surfaces
give texture to our lives,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.296
because buildings
create the spaces around them,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.336
and those spaces can draw people in

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.560
or push them away.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.976
And the difference often has to do
with the quality of those exteriors.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.736
So one contemporary equivalent
of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.080
is the Place de la DÃ©fense in Paris,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.496
a windswept, glass-walled open space

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.296
that office workers hurry through

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.816
on the way from the metro
to their cubicles

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.200
but otherwise spend
as little time in as possible.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.416
In the early 1980s,
the architect Philip Johnson

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.200
tried to recreate a gracious
European plaza in Pittsburgh.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.176
This is PPG Place,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.416
a half acre of open space
encircled by commercial buildings

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.896
made of mirrored glass.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.336
And he ornamented those buildings
with metal trim and bays

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.296
and Gothic turrets

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.040
which really pop on the skyline.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.160
But at ground level,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.240
the plaza feels like a black glass cage.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.936
I mean, sure, in summertime

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.416
kids are running back and forth
through the fountain

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.416
and there's ice-skating in the winter,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.656
but it lacks the informality
of a leisurely hangout.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.680
It's just not the sort of place
you really want to just hang out and chat.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.216
Public spaces thrive or fail
for many different reasons.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.640
Architecture is only one,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.880
but it's an important one.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.176
Some recent plazas

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.560
like Federation Square in Melbourne

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.080
or Superkilen in Copenhagen

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.336
succeed because they combine old and new,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560
rough and smooth,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.256
neutral and bright colors,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.920
and because they don't rely
excessively on glass.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.960
Now, I'm not against glass.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.520
It's an ancient and versatile material.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.856
It's easy to manufacture and transport

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.936
and install and replace

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.496
and clean.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.416
It comes in everything
from enormous, ultraclear sheets

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.520
to translucent bricks.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.496
New coatings make it change mood

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.760
in the shifting light.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.136
In expensive cities like New York,
it has the magical power

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.776
of being able to multiply
real estate values by allowing views,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.896
which is really the only commodity
that developers have to offer

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.640
to justify those surreal prices.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.336
In the middle of the 19th century,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.136
with the construction
of the Crystal Palace in London,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.200
glass leapt to the top of the list
of quintessentially modern substances.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.776
By the mid-20th century,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.920
it had come to dominate
the downtowns of some American cities,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.696
largely through some
really spectacular office buildings

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.680
like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,
designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.256
Eventually, the technology
advanced to the point

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.376
where architects could design
structures so transparent

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.686
they practically disappear.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.776
And along the way,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.840
glass became the default material
of the high-rise city,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.176
and there's a very
powerful reason for that.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.920
Because as the world's populations
converge on cities,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.656
the least fortunate pack
into jerry-built shantytowns.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.496
But hundreds of millions of people
need apartments and places to work

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.736
in ever-larger buildings,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.376
so it makes economic sense
to put up towers

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.880
and wrap them in cheap
and practical curtain walls.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.160
But glass has a limited ability

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.280
to be expressive.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.416
This is a section of wall framing a plaza

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.520
in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla,
in southern Mexico.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.136
Those 2,000-year-old carvings

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.200
make it clear that this was a place
of high ritual significance.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.016
Today we look at those and we can see
a historical and textural continuity

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.896
between those carvings,
the mountains all around

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.776
and that church which is built
on top of the ruins

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.960
using stone plundered from the site.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.776
In nearby Oaxaca,
even ordinary plaster buildings

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.136
become canvasses for
bright colors, political murals

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.000
and sophisticated graphic arts.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.600
It's an intricate, communicative language

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.039
that an epidemic of glass
would simply wipe out.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.736
The good news is
that architects and developers

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.736
have begun to rediscover
the joys of texture

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.800
without backing away from modernity.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.360
Some find innovative uses
for old materials like brick

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.520
and terra-cotta.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.056
Others invent new products
like the molded panels that SnÃ¸hetta used

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.496
to give the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.880
that crinkly, sculptural quality.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.416
The architect Stefano Boeri
even created living facades.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.456
This is his Vertical Forest,
a pair of apartment towers in Milan,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.360
whose most visible feature is greenery.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.760
And Boeri is designing a version of this
for Nanjing in China.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.216
And imagine if green facades
were as ubiquitous as glass ones

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.880
how much cleaner the air
in Chinese cities would become.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.296
But the truth is
that these are mostly one-offs,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.816
boutique projects,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.080
not easily reproduced at a global scale.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.200
And that is the point.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.456
When you use materials
that have a local significance,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.600
you prevent cities
from all looking the same.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.616
Copper has a long history in New York --

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.960
the Statue of Liberty,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.530
the crown of the Woolworth Building --

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.376
but it fell out of fashion for a long time

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.776
until SHoP Architects used it
to cover the American Copper Building,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.240
a pair of twisting towers
on the East River.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.416
It's not even finished

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.536
and you can see the way
sunset lights up that metallic facade,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.600
which will weather to green as it ages.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.016
Buildings can be like people.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.360
Their faces broadcast their experience.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.856
And that's an important point,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.920
because when glass ages,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.296
you just replace it,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.216
and the building looks
pretty much the same way it did before

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.936
until eventually it's demolished.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.736
Almost all other materials
have the ability

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.336
to absorb infusions of history and memory,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.680
and project it into the present.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.696
The firm Ennead

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.616
clad the Utah Natural History Museum
in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.840
ores that have been mined
in the area for 150 years

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.520
and that also camouflage the building
against the ochre hills

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.656
so that you have a natural history museum

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.920
that reflects the region's
natural history.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.456
And when the Chinese
Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.816
was building a history museum in Ningbo,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.056
he didn't just create
a wrapper for the past,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.136
he built memory right into the walls

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.856
by using brick and stones and shingles

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.640
salvaged from villages
that had been demolished.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.296
Now, architects can use glass

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.096
in equally lyrical and inventive ways.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.816
Here in New York, two buildings,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.480
one by Jean Nouvel
and this one by Frank Gehry

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.000
face off across West 19th Street,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.736
and the play of reflections
that they toss back and forth

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.120
is like a symphony in light.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.296
But when a city defaults to glass

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.816
as it grows,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.400
it becomes a hall of mirrors,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.280
disquieting and cold.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.880
After all, cities are places
of concentrated variety

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.696
where the world's cultures
and languages and lifestyles

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.920
come together and mingle.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So rather than encase all that variety

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.776
and diversity in buildings
of crushing sameness,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.480
we should have an architecture that honors
the full range of the urban experience.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.216
Thank you.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.638
(Applause)
