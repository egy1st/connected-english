00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:04.120
So, this happy pic of me
was taken in 1999.

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.234
I was a senior in college,

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.190
and it was right after a dance practice.

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:09.732
I was really, really happy.

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:14.214
And I remember exactly where I was
about a week and a half later.

00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:17.457
I was sitting in the back
of my used minivan

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.244
in a campus parking lot,

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:20.419
when I decided

00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:22.222
I was going to commit suicide.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:28.013
I went from deciding
to full-blown planning very quickly.

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:31.563
And I came this close
to the edge of the precipice.

00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:33.224
It's the closest I've ever come.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:36.661
And the only reason I took
my finger off the trigger

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:39.108
was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.370
And after the fact,

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:44.516
that's what scared me the most:
the element of chance.

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.434
So I became very methodical
about testing different ways

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.588
that I could manage my ups and downs,

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:54.481
which has proven to be
a good investment. (Laughs)

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.657
Many normal people might have,
say, six to 10 major depressive episodes

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.208
in their lives.

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:02.558
I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family.

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.607
I've had 50-plus at this point,

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.152
and I've learned a lot.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.748
I've had a lot of at-bats,

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:12.113
many rounds in the ring with darkness,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.597
taking good notes.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.296
So I thought rather than get up
and give any type of recipe for success

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.473
or highlight reel,

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:22.336
I would share my recipe
for avoiding self-destruction,

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:25.238
and certainly self-paralysis.

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.215
And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.675
for emotional free fall

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:34.252
is actually the same tool

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:36.877
that has helped me to make
my best business decisions.

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.221
But that is secondary.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.850
And it is ... stoicism.

00:01:41.874 --> 00:01:43.398
That sounds boring.

00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:44.485
(Laughter)

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.125
You might think of Spock,

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.664
or it might conjure and image like this --

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:50.164
(Laughter)

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:52.165
a cow standing in the rain.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.510
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:59.334
It's just an impassive creature taking
whatever life sends its way.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:04.295
You might not think of the ultimate
competitor, say, Bill Belichick,

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.575
head coach of the New England Patriots,

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.648
who has the all-time NFL record
for Super Bowl titles.

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:15.027
And stoicism has spread like wildfire
in the top of the NFL ranks

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.208
as a means of mental toughness
training in the last few years.

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.441
You might not think
of the Founding Fathers --

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:25.603
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
George Washington

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:28.419
to name but three students of stoicism.

00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:32.541
George Washington actually had
a play about a Stoic --

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.548
this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.759
performed for his troops at Valley Forge
to keep them motivated.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:42.426
So why would people of action
focus so much on an ancient philosophy?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.136
This seems very academic.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:48.208
I would encourage you to think
about stoicism a little bit differently,

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:51.495
as an operating system for thriving
in high-stress environments,

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.001
for making better decisions.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.149
And it all started here,

00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:57.336
kind of,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.806
on a porch.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.087
So around 300 BC in Athens,

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.984
someone named Zeno of Citium
taught many lectures

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:07.760
walking around a painted porch, a "stoa."

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:09.516
That later became "stoicism."

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.797
And in the Greco-Roman world,

00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.583
people used stoicism
as a comprehensive system

00:03:15.607 --> 00:03:17.017
for doing many, many things.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.729
But for our purposes, chief among them
was training yourself

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:25.200
to separate what you can control
from what you cannot control,

00:03:25.224 --> 00:03:28.282
and then doing exercises
to focus exclusively

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:29.457
on the former.

00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:31.859
This decreases emotional reactivity,

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:33.431
which can be a superpower.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.024
Conversely, let's say
you're a quarterback.

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:39.240
You miss a pass.
You get furious with yourself.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:40.770
That could cost you a game.

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:45.188
If you're a CEO, and you fly
off the handle at a very valued employee

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:46.712
because of a minor infraction,

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.747
that could cost you the employee.

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:54.279
If you're a college student
who, say, is in a downward spiral,

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:57.093
and you feel helpless and hopeless,

00:03:57.117 --> 00:03:59.094
unabated, that could cost you your life.

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:01.377
So the stakes are very, very high.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:05.395
And there are many tools
in the toolkit to get you there.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.256
I'm going to focus on one
that completely changed my life in 2004.

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.619
It found me then because of two things:

00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:18.008
a very close friend, young guy, my age,
died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:21.860
and then my girlfriend, who I thought
I was going to marry, walked out.

00:04:21.884 --> 00:04:25.929
She'd had enough, and she didn't
give me a Dear John letter,

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.304
but she did give me this,

00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:29.640
a Dear John plaque.

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:30.712
(Laughter)

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.521
I'm not making this up. I've kept it.

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:35.182
"Business hours are over at five o'clock."

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:37.972
She gave this to me
to put on my desk for personal health,

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:41.265
because at the time, I was working
on my first real business.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.408
I had no idea what I was doing.
I was working 14-plus hour days,

00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:45.865
seven days a week.

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.592
I was using stimulants to get going.

00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:51.197
I was using depressants
to wind down and go to sleep.

00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:52.412
It was a disaster.

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.940
I felt completely trapped.

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:58.712
I bought a book on simplicity
to try to find answers.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:02.565
And I did find a quote
that made a big difference in my life,

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.736
which was, "We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,"

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.544
by Seneca the Younger,

00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:11.191
who was a famous Stoic writer.

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:13.031
That took me to his letters,

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:15.508
which took me to the exercise,

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.035
"premeditatio malorum,"

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:20.355
which means the pre-meditation of evils.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:21.535
In simple terms,

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:26.678
this is visualizing the worst-case
scenarios, in detail, that you fear,

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:28.419
preventing you from taking action,

00:05:28.443 --> 00:05:31.183
so that you can take action
to overcome that paralysis.

00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:35.096
My problem was monkey mind --
super loud, very incessant.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.709
Just thinking my way
through problems doesn't work.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:39.758
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.

00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:41.749
So I created a written exercise

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:44.155
that I called "fear-setting,"
like goal-setting,

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:45.348
for myself.

00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:47.471
It consists of three pages.

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:49.169
Super simple.

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:51.797
The first page is right here.

00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.997
"What if I ...?"

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.578
This is whatever you fear,

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:57.685
whatever is causing you anxiety,

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:59.070
whatever you're putting off.

00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:00.581
It could be asking someone out,

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.229
ending a relationship,

00:06:02.253 --> 00:06:05.291
asking for a promotion,
quitting a job, starting a company.

00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:06.472
It could be anything.

00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:09.528
For me, it was taking
my first vacation in four years

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:12.559
and stepping away from my business
for a month to go to London,

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.627
where I could stay
in a friend's room for free,

00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.357
to either remove myself
as a bottleneck in the business

00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.626
or shut it down.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:22.483
In the first column, "Define,"

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.011
you're writing down all of the worst
things you can imagine happening

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:27.586
if you take that step.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.172
You want 10 to 20.

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:32.216
I won't go through all of them,
but I'll give you two examples.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.956
One was, I'll go to London,
it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.203
the whole thing will be
a huge waste of time.

00:06:38.227 --> 00:06:41.031
Number two, I'll miss
a letter from the IRS,

00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:42.570
and I'll get audited

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:45.132
or raided or shut down or some such.

00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:47.559
And then you go to the "Prevent" column.

00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.733
In that column, you write
down the answer to:

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:52.852
What could I do to prevent
each of these bullets from happening,

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:56.350
or, at the very least, decrease
the likelihood even a little bit?

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:59.224
So for getting depressed in London,

00:06:59.248 --> 00:07:01.262
I could take a portable blue light with me

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:03.281
and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:05.960
I knew that helped stave off
depressive episodes.

00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:09.855
For the IRS bit, I could change
the mailing address on file with the IRS

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.946
so the paperwork would go to my accountant

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.923
instead of to my UPS address.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:15.396
Easy-peasy.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.462
Then we go to "Repair."

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.708
So if the worst-case scenarios happen,

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.698
what could you do to repair
the damage even a little bit,

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:25.488
or who could you ask for help?

00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:27.920
So in the first case, London,

00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:31.619
well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun --

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:34.290
undo the damage, if I got into a funk.

00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:36.723
In the case of missing
a letter from the IRS,

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.188
I could call a friend who is a lawyer

00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.706
or ask, say, a professor of law

00:07:42.777 --> 00:07:44.078
what they would recommend,

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:47.298
who I should talk to,
how had people handled this in the past.

00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:51.359
So one question to keep in mind
as you're doing this first page is:

00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:53.540
Has anyone else in the history of time

00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:55.671
less intelligent or less driven

00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:56.919
figured this out?

00:07:57.383 --> 00:07:59.679
Chances are, the answer is "Yes."

00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:00.705
(Laughter)

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.806
The second page is simple:

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:07.674
What might be the benefits
of an attempt or a partial success?

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:09.509
You can see we're playing up the fears

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:12.415
and really taking a conservative
look at the upside.

00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:15.290
So if you attempted whatever
you're considering,

00:08:15.314 --> 00:08:17.498
might you build confidence,
develop skills,

00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:20.304
emotionally, financially, otherwise?

00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:23.067
What might be the benefits
of, say, a base hit?

00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.158
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.

00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:26.728
Page three.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:29.164
This might be the most important,
so don't skip it:

00:08:29.188 --> 00:08:30.738
"The Cost of Inaction."

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:33.670
Humans are very good at considering
what might go wrong

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:37.083
if we try something new,
say, ask for a raise.

00:08:37.107 --> 00:08:42.705
What we don't often consider
is the atrocious cost of the status quo --

00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.163
not changing anything.

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.810
So you should ask yourself,

00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:50.034
if I avoid this action or decision

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:53.565
and actions and decisions like it,

00:08:53.589 --> 00:08:58.346
what might my life look like in,
say, six months, 12 months, three years?

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.858
Any further out, it starts
to seem intangible.

00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:04.729
And really get detailed --
again, emotionally, financially,

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:05.951
physically, whatever.

00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.274
And when I did this, it painted
a terrifying picture.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.834
I was self-medicating,

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:15.178
my business was going to implode
at any moment at all times,

00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:16.367
if I didn't step away.

00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:18.924
My relationships were fraying or failing.

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:23.049
And I realized that inaction
was no longer an option for me.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:26.922
Those are the three pages. That's it.
That's fear-setting.

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:30.537
And after this, I realized
that on a scale of one to 10,

00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:34.128
one being minimal impact,
10 being maximal impact,

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.794
if I took the trip, I was risking

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:39.152
a one to three of temporary
and reversible pain

00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:43.187
for an eight to 10 of positive,
life-changing impact

00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:44.813
that could be a semi-permanent.

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:47.163
So I took the trip.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.962
None of the disasters came to pass.

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:50.481
There were some hiccups, sure.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:53.047
I was able to extricate myself
from the business.

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.929
I ended up extending that trip
for a year and a half around the world,

00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.159
and that became the basis
for my first book,

00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:00.660
that leads me here today.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:04.016
And I can trace all of my biggest wins

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.943
and all of my biggest disasters averted

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.849
back to doing fear-setting

00:10:08.873 --> 00:10:10.444
at least once a quarter.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.409
It's not a panacea.

00:10:12.433 --> 00:10:15.323
You'll find that some of your fears
are very well-founded.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:16.402
(Laughter)

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:18.077
But you shouldn't conclude that

00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:20.648
without first putting them
under a microscope.

00:10:21.324 --> 00:10:24.533
And it doesn't make all the hard times,
the hard choices, easy,

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.508
but it can make a lot of them easier.

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:31.574
I'd like to close with a profile
of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.

00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:34.063
This is Jerzy Gregorek.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:38.231
He is a four-time world champion
in Olympic weightlifting,

00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:39.629
political refugee,

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:40.934
published poet,

00:10:41.546 --> 00:10:42.935
62 years old.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:46.429
He can still kick my ass and probably
most asses in this room.

00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:48.639
He's an impressive guy.

00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:50.927
I spent a lot of time
on his stoa, his porch,

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.955
asking life and training advice.

00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:57.352
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,

00:10:57.376 --> 00:11:00.042
which was a nonviolent
movement for social change

00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:02.843
that was violently suppressed
by the government.

00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.913
He lost his career as a firefighter.

00:11:04.937 --> 00:11:08.058
Then his mentor, a priest,
was kidnapped, tortured, killed

00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:09.716
and thrown into a river.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.954
He was then threatened.

00:11:10.978 --> 00:11:14.136
He and his wife had to flee Poland,
bounce from country to country

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.614
until they landed in the US
with next to nothing,

00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:18.031
sleeping on floors.

00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:22.462
He now lives in Woodside, California,
in a very nice place,

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:25.111
and of the 10,000-plus people
I've met in my life,

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:27.419
I would put him in the top 10,

00:11:27.443 --> 00:11:29.637
in terms of success and happiness.

00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:32.898
And there's a punchline coming,
so pay attention.

00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:34.785
I sent him a text a few weeks ago,

00:11:34.809 --> 00:11:37.604
asking him: Had he ever read
any Stoic philosophy?

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:40.026
And he replied with two pages of text.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.295
This is very unlike him.
He is a terse dude.

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:43.811
(Laughter)

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:46.896
And not only was he familiar
with stoicism,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.314
but he pointed out, for all
of his most important decisions,

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:51.845
his inflection points,

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:55.455
when he stood up
for his principles and ethics,

00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:59.244
how he had used stoicism
and something akin to fear-setting,

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:00.430
which blew my mind.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.101
And he closed with two things.

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:05.852
Number one: he couldn't imagine
any life more beautiful

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:07.335
than that of a Stoic.

00:12:08.813 --> 00:12:11.741
And the last was his mantra,
which he applies to everything,

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:13.889
and you can apply to everything:

00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:17.413
"Easy choices, hard life.

00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:20.566
Hard choices, easy life."

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:24.249
The hard choices --

00:12:24.273 --> 00:12:28.082
what we most fear doing, asking, saying --

00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.571
these are very often exactly
what we most need to do.

00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.457
And the biggest challenges
and problems we face

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:39.576
will never be solved
with comfortable conversations,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.306
whether it's in your own head
or with other people.

00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.169
So I encourage you to ask yourselves:

00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:47.108
Where in your lives right now

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:51.926
might defining your fears be more
important than defining your goals?

00:12:52.966 --> 00:12:56.171
Keeping in mind all the while,
the words of Seneca:

00:12:56.195 --> 00:13:00.144
"We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality."

00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:01.340
Thank you very much.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:08.222
(Applause)
