WEBVTT

00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:03.343
I'm going to give you
four specific examples,

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:05.233
I'm going to cover at the end

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:07.908
about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales;

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:10.976
how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.976
to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.095
And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years --

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.793
a record label I started
that had a CD called "Sauce."

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:28.054
Before I can do that
I've got to tell you about sliced bread,

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:29.777
and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:33.060
Now, before sliced bread
was invented in the 1910s

00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:35.031
I wonder what they said?

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.151
Like the greatest invention
since the telegraph or something.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:41.443
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
invented sliced bread,

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:46.476
and he focused, like most inventors did,
on the patent part and the making part.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.723
And the thing about the invention
of sliced bread is this --

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:53.812
that for the first 15 years
after sliced bread was available

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:56.202
no one bought it; no one knew about it;

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:58.500
it was a complete and total failure.

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:03.476
And the reason
is that until Wonder came along

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.242
and figured out how to spread
the idea of sliced bread,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.460
no one wanted it.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.476
That the success of sliced bread,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.146
like the success of almost everything
we've talked about at this conference,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.810
is not always about what the patent
is like, or what the factory is like --

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.476
it's about can you get
your idea to spread, or not.

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.488
And I think that the way
you're going to get what you want,

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:30.432
or cause the change that you want
to change, to happen,

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.924
is to figure out a way
to get your ideas to spread.

00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:36.196
And it doesn't matter to me
whether you're running a coffee shop

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.510
or you're an intellectual,
or you're in business,

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:40.775
or you're flying hot air balloons.

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:46.822
I think that all this stuff applies
to everybody regardless of what we do.

00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:52.036
That what we are living in
is a century of idea diffusion.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.318
That people who can spread ideas,
regardless of what those ideas are, win.

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:58.894
When I talk about it
I usually pick business,

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.423
because they make the best pictures
that you can put in your presentation,

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:05.113
and because it's the easiest
sort of way to keep score.

00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:07.695
But I want you to forgive me
when I use these examples

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.320
because I'm talking about anything
that you decide to spend your time to do.

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:15.786
At the heart of spreading ideas
is TV and stuff like TV.

00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:22.946
TV and mass media made it really easy
to spread ideas in a certain way.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.986
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.438
The way the TV-industrial complex works,
is you buy some ads,

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:31.025
interrupt some people,
that gets you distribution.

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:34.771
You use the distribution you get
to sell more products.

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:38.914
You take the profit
from that to buy more ads.

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:40.914
And it goes around and around and around,

00:02:40.938 --> 00:02:44.415
the same way that the military-industrial
complex worked a long time ago.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.486
That model of,
and we heard it yesterday --

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.803
if we could only get
onto the homepage of Google,

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:51.366
if we could only figure out
how to get promoted there,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.104
or grab that person by the throat,

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:55.893
and tell them about what we want to do.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.476
If we did that then everyone would pay
attention, and we would win.

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:05.275
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed
my entire childhood and probably yours.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.068
I mean, all of these products succeeded
because someone figured out

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:13.156
how to touch people in a way
they weren't expecting,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.520
in a way they didn't
necessarily want, with an ad,

00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:17.773
over and over again until they bought it.

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:21.731
And the thing that's happened is,
they canceled the TV-industrial complex.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.604
That just over the last few years,

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:27.452
what anybody who markets
anything has discovered

00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:29.896
is that it's not working
the way that it used to.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.509
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize;
I had a bad cold when I took it.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:35.088
(Laughter)

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:38.607
But the product in the blue box
in the center is my poster child.

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.599
I go to the deli; I'm sick;
I need to buy some medicine.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.357
The brand manager for that blue product
spent 100 million dollars

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:47.064
trying to interrupt me in one year.

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:50.354
100 million dollars interrupting me
with TV commercials

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:52.246
and magazine ads and Spam

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.070
and coupons and shelving
allowances and spiff --

00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:57.476
all so I could ignore
every single message.

00:03:58.014 --> 00:04:00.047
And I ignored every message

00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.189
because I don't have
a pain reliever problem.

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:04.869
I buy the stuff in the yellow box
because I always have.

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:09.148
And I'm not going to invest a minute
of my time to solve her problem,

00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:10.477
because I don't care.

00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:16.719
Here's a magazine called "Hydrate."
It's 180 pages about water.

00:04:16.743 --> 00:04:17.744
(Laughter)

00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:20.458
Articles about water, ads about water.

00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:23.594
Imagine what the world
was like 40 years ago,

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:26.342
with just the Saturday Evening Post
and Time and Newsweek.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.130
Now there are magazines about water.

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.878
New product from Coke Japan: water salad.

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:32.361
(Laughter)

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:37.019
Coke Japan comes out
with a new product every three weeks,

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:40.559
because they have no idea
what's going to work and what's not.

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:42.668
I couldn't have written
this better myself.

00:04:42.692 --> 00:04:44.210
It came out four days ago --

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:46.806
I circled the important parts
so you can see them here.

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:49.265
They've come out...

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.830
Arby's is going to spend
85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:56.179
with the voice of Tom Arnold,

00:04:56.203 --> 00:05:01.051
hoping that that will get people to go
to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.

00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:02.081
(Laughter)

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:07.629
Now, I had tried to imagine what could
possibly be in an animated TV commercial

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:11.161
featuring Tom Arnold,
that would get you to get in your car,

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:14.375
drive across town
and buy a roast beef sandwich.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.772
(Laughter)

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:19.176
Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.937
when he was talking to anyone
who needs to hear your idea.

00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:23.613
"The world revolves around me."

00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:26.237
Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.

00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:29.938
I don't want to get email
from anybody; I want to get "memail."

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.476
(Laughter)

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.150
So consumers, and I don't just mean
people who buy stuff at the Safeway;

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:40.286
I mean people at the Defense Department
who might buy something,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.532
or people at, you know, the New Yorker
who might print your article.

00:05:43.556 --> 00:05:48.351
Consumers don't care about you
at all; they just don't care.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:52.168
Part of the reason is -- they've got
way more choices than they used to,

00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:54.017
and way less time.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.309
And in a world where we have
too many choices and too little time,

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:01.717
the obvious thing to do
is just ignore stuff.

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.423
And my parable here
is you're driving down the road

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:10.296
and you see a cow, and you keep driving
because you've seen cows before.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.154
Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.

00:06:13.178 --> 00:06:16.580
Who's going to stop and pull over
and say -- "Oh, look, a cow."

00:06:16.604 --> 00:06:17.755
Nobody.

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.476
(Laughter)

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.144
But if the cow was purple --
isn't that a great special effect?

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:24.827
I could do that again if you want.

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:29.476
If the cow was purple,
you'd notice it for a while.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.548
I mean, if all cows were purple
you'd get bored with those, too.

00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:36.368
The thing that's going to decide
what gets talked about,

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:38.095
what gets done, what gets changed,

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.553
what gets purchased, what gets built,

00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:42.867
is: "Is it remarkable?"

00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:45.839
And "remarkable" is a really cool word,

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:47.908
because we think it just means "neat,"

00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:51.268
but it also means
"worth making a remark about."

00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:55.587
And that is the essence
of where idea diffusion is going.

00:06:56.078 --> 00:06:59.073
That two of the hottest cars
in the United States

00:06:59.097 --> 00:07:02.254
is a 55,000-dollar giant car,

00:07:02.278 --> 00:07:05.389
big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.

00:07:05.413 --> 00:07:07.506
People are paying full price for both,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.319
and the only thing they have in common

00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:13.279
is that they don't have
anything in common.

00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:14.477
(Laughter)

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:19.623
Every week, the number one
best-selling DVD in America changes.

00:07:20.202 --> 00:07:23.027
It's never "The Godfather,"
it's never "Citizen Kane,"

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:26.891
it's always some third-rate movie
with some second-rate star.

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:31.476
But the reason it's number one
is because that's the week it came out.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.476
Because it's new, because it's fresh.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.980
People saw it and said
"I didn't know that was there"

00:07:36.004 --> 00:07:37.251
and they noticed it.

00:07:37.275 --> 00:07:40.428
Two of the big success stories
of the last 20 years in retail --

00:07:40.452 --> 00:07:43.414
one sells things that are
super-expensive in a blue box,

00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:46.475
and one sells things that are
as cheap as they can make them.

00:07:46.914 --> 00:07:49.780
The only thing they have in common
is that they're different.

00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:53.136
We're now in the fashion business,
no matter what we do for a living,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.690
we're in the fashion business.

00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:56.476
And people in the fashion business

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.903
know what it's like to be in the fashion
business -- they're used to it.

00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:02.554
The rest of us have to figure out
how to think that way.

00:08:02.578 --> 00:08:03.800
How to understand

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:07.107
that it's not about interrupting
people with big full-page ads,

00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.709
or insisting on meetings with people.

00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:12.549
But it's a totally different
sort of process

00:08:12.573 --> 00:08:15.476
that determines which ideas spread,
and which ones don't.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.446
They sold a billion dollars'
worth of Aeron chairs

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.836
by reinventing
what it meant to sell a chair.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.081
They turned a chair from something
the purchasing department bought,

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:29.342
to something that was a status symbol
about where you sat at work.

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:33.921
This guy, Lionel Poilâne,
the most famous baker in the world --

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:36.032
he died two and a half months ago,

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:38.104
and he was a hero of mine
and a dear friend.

00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:39.318
He lived in Paris.

00:08:39.342 --> 00:08:43.245
Last year, he sold 10 million dollars'
worth of French bread.

00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:46.076
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.910
by one baker at a time,
in a wood-fired oven.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.998
And when Lionel started his bakery,
the French pooh-pooh-ed it.

00:08:53.022 --> 00:08:54.682
They didn't want to buy his bread.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.447
It didn't look like "French bread."

00:08:56.471 --> 00:08:57.852
It wasn't what they expected.

00:08:57.876 --> 00:09:00.746
It was neat; it was remarkable;

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.083
and slowly, it spread
from one person to another person

00:09:04.107 --> 00:09:08.373
until finally, it became the official
bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.397
Now he's in London, and he ships
by FedEx all around the world.

00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:16.761
What marketers used to do is make
average products for average people.

00:09:17.134 --> 00:09:18.927
That's what mass marketing is.

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:23.079
Smooth out the edges; go for the center;
that's the big market.

00:09:23.103 --> 00:09:27.476
They would ignore the geeks,
and God forbid, the laggards.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.476
It was all about going for the center.

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:33.167
But in a world where
the TV-industrial complex is broken,

00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:35.811
I don't think that's a strategy
we want to use any more.

00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:39.609
I think the strategy we want to use
is to not market to these people

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:41.919
because they're really good
at ignoring you.

00:09:41.943 --> 00:09:44.697
But market to these
people because they care.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.165
These are the people
who are obsessed with something.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.720
And when you talk to them, they'll listen,

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:54.363
because they like listening --
it's about them.

00:09:54.387 --> 00:09:58.342
And if you're lucky, they'll tell
their friends on the rest of the curve,

00:09:58.366 --> 00:09:59.553
and it'll spread.

00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.356
It'll spread to the entire curve.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.019
They have something I call "otaku" --
it's a great Japanese word.

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:08.041
It describes the desire
of someone who's obsessed to say,

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.898
drive across Tokyo to try
a new ramen noodle place,

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:13.494
because that's what they do:
they get obsessed with it.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.237
To make a product, to market an idea,

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:18.357
to come up with any problem
you want to solve

00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:21.690
that doesn't have
a constituency with an otaku,

00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:22.936
is almost impossible.

00:10:23.301 --> 00:10:26.943
Instead, you have to find
a group that really, desperately cares

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.610
about what it is you have to say.

00:10:28.634 --> 00:10:31.717
Talk to them and make it easy
for them to tell their friends.

00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:35.185
There's a hot sauce otaku,
but there's no mustard otaku.

00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:38.558
That's why there's lots and lots
of kinds of hot sauces,

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:40.169
and not so many kinds of mustard.

00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:42.676
Not because it's hard
to make interesting mustard --

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.491
you could make interesting mustard --

00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:46.990
but people don't,
because no one's obsessed with it,

00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:48.795
and thus no one tells their friends.

00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:51.198
Krispy Kreme has figured
this whole thing out.

00:10:51.222 --> 00:10:53.102
It has a strategy, and what they do is,

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:55.933
they enter a city, they talk
to the people, with the otaku,

00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:57.879
and then they spread through the city

00:10:57.903 --> 00:10:59.999
to the people who've just
crossed the street.

00:11:00.023 --> 00:11:04.457
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars,
but it sleeps for 12 minutes.

00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:06.518
Not everybody wants it
but they don't care.

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:10.069
They want to talk to the people
who do, and maybe it'll spread.

00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:13.476
These guys make the loudest
car stereo in the world.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.476
(Laughter)

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.644
It's as loud as a 747 jet.

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:20.619
You can't get in,
the car's got bulletproof glass,

00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:22.882
because it'll blow out
the windshield otherwise.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:24.209
But the fact remains

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:27.367
that when someone wants to put
a couple of speakers in their car,

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:30.391
if they've got the otaku
or they've heard from someone who does,

00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:32.072
they go ahead and they pick this.

00:11:32.096 --> 00:11:35.087
It's really simple -- you sell
to the people who are listening,

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.433
and just maybe,
those people tell their friends.

00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:40.714
So when Steve Jobs talks
to 50,000 people at his keynote,

00:11:40.738 --> 00:11:43.358
who are all tuned in from 130 countries

00:11:43.382 --> 00:11:45.476
watching his two-hour commercial --

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.120
that's the only thing keeping
his company in business --

00:11:48.144 --> 00:11:50.793
it's that those 50,000 people
care desperately enough

00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:53.627
to watch a two-hour commercial,
and then tell their friends.

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.332
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released
in the last two years.

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:58.713
Every one made a profit. How?

00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:00.524
They only sell them on their website.

00:12:00.548 --> 00:12:02.650
Those people who buy them have the otaku,

00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:05.727
and then they tell their friends,
and it spreads and it spreads.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:09.709
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars,
10 times the standard.

00:12:10.082 --> 00:12:12.756
But hospitals are buying it
faster than any other model.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.476
Hard Candy nail polish,
doesn't appeal to everybody,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.979
but to the people who love it,
they talk about it like crazy.

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:24.646
This paint can right here saved
the Dutch Boy paint company,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.959
making them a fortune.

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:28.030
It costs 35 percent more
than regular paint

00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:32.095
because Dutch Boy made a can that people
talk about, because it's remarkable.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:34.262
They didn't just slap
a new ad on the product;

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.779
they changed what it meant
to build a paint product.

00:12:36.803 --> 00:12:41.476
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday
250,000 people go to this site,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.476
run by two volunteers, and I can
tell you they are hard graders --

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.310
(Laughter)

00:12:49.334 --> 00:12:52.382
They didn't get this way
by advertising a lot.

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:55.170
They got this way by being remarkable,

00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:56.959
sometimes a little too remarkable.

00:12:56.983 --> 00:13:01.282
And this picture frame
has a cord going out the back,

00:13:01.306 --> 00:13:02.955
and you plug it into the wall.

00:13:02.979 --> 00:13:04.828
My father has this on his desk,

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:09.288
and he sees his grandchildren
everyday, changing constantly.

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:11.859
And every single person
who walks into his office

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:14.812
hears the whole story
of how this thing ended up on his desk.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.476
And one person at a time,
the idea spreads.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.279
These are not diamonds, not really.

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:22.476
They're made from "cremains."

00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:25.637
After you're cremated you can
have yourself made into a gem.

00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:26.708
(Laughter)

00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:29.018
Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:34.731
(Laughter)

00:13:34.755 --> 00:13:37.739
Fastest-growing business
in the whole mortuary industry.

00:13:38.244 --> 00:13:40.269
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne --

00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:42.579
you don't have to be
super-outrageous to do this.

00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:43.817
What you have to do

00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:46.608
is figure out what people
really want and give it to them.

00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:48.299
A couple of quick rules to wrap up.

00:13:48.323 --> 00:13:52.042
The first one is: Design
is free when you get to scale.

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:54.454
The people who come up
with stuff that's remarkable

00:13:54.478 --> 00:13:57.668
more often than not figure out
how to put design to work for them.

00:13:57.692 --> 00:14:02.548
Number two: The riskiest thing
you can do now is be safe.

00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:04.476
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.548
The whole model of being
Proctor and Gamble

00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:09.003
is always about average products
for average people.

00:14:09.027 --> 00:14:10.193
That's risky.

00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:13.375
The safe thing to do now
is to be at the fringes,

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.562
be remarkable.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.544
And being very good is one
of the worst things you can possibly do.

00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:21.983
Very good is boring. Very good is average.

00:14:22.007 --> 00:14:24.586
It doesn't matter whether
you're making a record album,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.307
or you're an architect,
or you have a tract on sociology.

00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:31.199
If it's very good, it's not going to work,
because no one's going to notice it.

00:14:31.223 --> 00:14:32.599
So my three stories.

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:37.115
Silk put a product that does not need
to be in the refrigerated section

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:39.456
next to the milk
in the refrigerated section.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.266
Sales tripled. Why?

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.829
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.

00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:47.730
For the people who were there
and looking at that section,

00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:48.960
it was remarkable.

00:14:48.984 --> 00:14:51.223
They didn't triple their sales
with advertising;

00:14:51.247 --> 00:14:53.429
they tripled it by doing
something remarkable.

00:14:53.453 --> 00:14:55.213
That is a remarkable piece of art.

00:14:55.237 --> 00:14:56.507
You don't have to like it,

00:14:56.531 --> 00:15:01.095
but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes
in the middle of New York City

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:02.270
is remarkable.

00:15:02.294 --> 00:15:03.365
(Laughter)

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:05.307
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum;

00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:08.217
he changed an entire city's economy

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:12.799
by designing one building that people
from all over the world went to see.

00:15:12.823 --> 00:15:14.728
Now, at countless meetings at, you know,

00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:17.476
the Portland City Council,
or who knows where,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.761
they said, we need an architect --
can we get Frank Gehry?

00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:23.476
Because he did something
that was at the fringes.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.743
And my big failure?
I came out with an entire --

00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.476
(Music)

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.267
A record album and hopefully
a whole bunch of record albums

00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:33.936
in SACD, this remarkable new format --

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.261
and I marketed it straight to people
with 20,000-dollar stereos.

00:15:37.285 --> 00:15:42.381
People with 20,000-dollar stereos
don't like new music.

00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:46.864
(Laughter)

00:15:46.888 --> 00:15:51.589
So what you need to do
is figure out who does care.

00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:54.128
Who is going to raise their hand and say,

00:15:54.152 --> 00:15:56.081
"I want to hear what you're doing next,"

00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:57.532
and sell something to them.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:59.680
The last example I want to give you.

00:15:59.704 --> 00:16:01.909
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.

00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:05.476
As you can see, if that's nowhere,
it's in the middle of it.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.019
(Laughter)

00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:13.428
But they do have a lake.

00:16:13.452 --> 00:16:16.358
And people used to come from miles
around to swim in the lake.

00:16:16.382 --> 00:16:17.547
They don't anymore.

00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.454
So the founding fathers said,
"We've got some money to spend.

00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:21.929
What can we build here?"

00:16:21.953 --> 00:16:23.447
And like most committees,

00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:25.663
they were going to build
something pretty safe.

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:29.021
And then an artist came to them --
this is a true artist's rendering --

00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:34.622
he wants to build a 55-foot tall
lava lamp in the center of town.

00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:37.924
That's a purple cow;
that's something worth noticing.

00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:39.107
I don't know about you,

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.512
but if they build it,
that's where I'm going to go.

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:43.536
Thank you very much for your attention.
