00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is to try to allow each of you to experience

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the thrill of revealing nature's design.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The challenge of looking at nature's designs --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The challenge, of course, is to answer this question:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what permits this extraordinary performance of animals

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that allows them basically to go anywhere?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
organisms have millions of years to get it right;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We know from working on animals that the truth is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
(Laughter)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, organisms have this important history.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You need to discover the general principles of nature,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is a real challenge to do this, because animals,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
when you start to really look inside them -- how they work --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Even the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is if the control of their movements

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
tended to be built into their bodies themselves.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
all produce the same forces on the ground when they move.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
or four legs as one of a trotting crab.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And then they alternate in their propulsion,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
-- you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
like T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now, what's interesting is the animals, then -- we said -- bounce along

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in "A Bug's Life," we discussed the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
bipedal nature of the characters of the ants.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
when you're telling us these animals are moving

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we collapsed them down as one.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We got some of the best mathematicians in the world

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
from Princeton to work on this problem.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And we were able to create a model

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
where animals are not only bouncing up and down,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now, why is this important to have this model?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and you perturb it, you give it a push,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(Laughter)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's enough!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The animals, when you look at them running,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
appear to be self-stabilizing like this,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
using basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
computations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
are embedded in the form of the animal itself.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
natural technologies, at least they have been so far.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Human technologies have tended to be large, flat,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Whereas nature tends to be small, and curved,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and has many muscles and many, many sensors.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So it's a very different design. However, what's changing,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
what's really exciting -- and I'll show you some of that next --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And here's one example that's really exciting.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that they like, and put in the material properties.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It just bends by itself beautifully.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Our work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from the University of Michigan and McGill

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
named RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Let's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and then some of the simple robots

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that have been inspired by our discoveries.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
not on a treadmill.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Here's what we do.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
(Laughter)

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
you think you don't have in your kitchen.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It goes up to four meters per second when it runs.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Now, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to have greater stability and maneuverability.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
of the animals that we're looking at.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Shape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
going on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
compared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
it can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's this technique of building the properties into the form.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
very robust, if a graduate student

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
does that to his thesis project.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
(Laughter)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
making its first outing in a demo.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(Laughter)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Same principle: it only has six moving parts,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
six motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Laughter)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
(Voice: Oh my God.)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Applause)

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Here's RHex entering the woods.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
(Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000
with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
especially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
we should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
just to give them the sense of being on Mars.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
(Laughter)

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
(Applause)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that we studied to look at this, is the gecko.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
One of the animals is going to be running on the level,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
is running up the wall?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Applause)

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and then peel off the surface, like tape.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Like if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
They do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Here's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You can't use regular cameras.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
You have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
through the treadmill belt, to see how they move.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Pick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
First we'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
transition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
There's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
The animal does not use that.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But that's what we're limited to, at the moment.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
What does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
that's there's little striations in these leaves.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
you'll see each hair has split ends.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
a gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Think of the contact of that that's possible.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
We were fortunate to work with another group

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
When we measured the forces, they were enormous.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size --

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
about 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
No, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
No, you can change the charge -- they still hold on.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
No, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don't do it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
How about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
where you had these two atoms, they're close together,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
with these small structures.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
What we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
(Laughter)

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
We also presented to Nike even.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
(Laughter)

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
(Applause)

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that we realized that that small-size scale --

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore --

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
we needed to look at ants and their feet, because

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
But the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
we'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Where's this going? I think you can see it already.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Clearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
You're going to be able to do programmable

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
work through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
If you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
search and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
or the various things we're working on, we must preserve

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Thank you.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
(Applause)
