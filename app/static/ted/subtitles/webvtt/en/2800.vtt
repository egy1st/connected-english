00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.576
The best Christmas my children ever had

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920
was also the worst Christmas
my husband and I ever had.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.616
Elizabeth, age seven,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.496
and her brother, Ian, age five,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.239
couldn't imagine why they were getting
everything they wanted for Christmas.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.960
The reason Santa was so generous

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.016
was because of something
my husband Pat and I knew

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.880
and the kids couldn't comprehend.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.600
Something that we had just learned,
and it terrified us.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.816
This was 1994

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200
and the story actually starts
a few years earlier.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.600
For a couple of years I had noticed
a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.880
that looked like prickly heat.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.840
For those same years,
my father and brother both died of cancer,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.280
and I was probably
overanxious about illness.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.896
The doctors assured us
there was nothing wrong

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.656
and I shouldn't worry,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.080
but I wasn't so sure.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.296
And so without a referral,
and paying out-of-pocket,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.519
I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.896
She was probably
just allergic to something,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.320
but why did it appear
just on the sides of her neck, this rash?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.776
So it's two days before Christmas,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
1994,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.576
and the dermatologist
takes a quick look at her neck and says,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640
"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
And then he shuts off the lights
and looks in her eyes.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.976
It turns out, by chance,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.120
this dermatologist
also trained in ophthalmology.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.280
Our lucky day.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.160
I am sick to my stomach.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.896
"Oma?"

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.816
Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma --

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040
cancer.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.576
"Why are you looking
in her eyes for a skin rash?"

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.680
I scream and make no sound.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.920
So there it is.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.360
Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000
PXE for short.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.176
Questions mix with fear

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400
and erupt like bile in my throat.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.640
Why are you looking in her eyes?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.816
What do you know about this?
How do you know for sure?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.320
What is the prognosis?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.920
My training in pastoral counseling
did not prepare me for this.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.560
Dr. Bercovitch tells us
everything he knows about PXE.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600
It's a rare genetic disorder,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000
it's systemic,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.960
it's a slowly progressing,
premature aging disease.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.400
It causes loose wrinkly skin
in the flexor areas.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.536
It causes legal blindness,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.280
like macular degeneration,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.680
and a host of cardiovascular problems.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.760
Little is known about this disease,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.416
and some people die in their 30s,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.920
say some of the reports at the time.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.240
He then just glances at our son and says,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.320
"He has it, too."

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.240
We want to flee
back to the land of normal.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.336
Two days after Christmas,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.376
researchers come
from a university in Boston,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.896
and they take blood
from us and our children

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.560
for a research project
focused on finding the gene.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.736
A few days later,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.176
researchers come
from a medical center in New York

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.720
and say they want blood, too.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.920
"These are children.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.656
They're five and seven years old.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.680
Don't make them face the needle twice.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.400
Go and get your share
from the other researchers."

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.656
They laugh, incredulous.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.880
"Share?"

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.600
It is then that we learn that there
is little sharing in biomedical research.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.216
This moment, more than any other,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.880
lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.816
Pat and I went to a medical school library

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.800
and we copied every article
we could find on PXE.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.680
We didn't understand a thing.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.576
We bought medical dictionaries
and scientific textbooks

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.743
and read everything
we could get our hands on.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.416
And though we still didn't understand,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.296
we could see patterns,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.696
and it became quickly
apparent within a month

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680
that there was no systematic effort
to understand PXE.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.216
In addition,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.480
the lack of sharing
that we experienced was pervasive.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.760
Researchers competed with each other

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.680
because the ecosystem
was designed to reward competition

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.520
rather than to alleviate suffering.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.856
We realized that we would have to do
work on this condition ourselves

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.400
to find solutions
for ourselves and others like us.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.896
But we faced two major barriers.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.416
The first one:

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.800
Pat and I have no science background.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.336
At the time, he's the manager
of a construction company,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.216
and I'm a former college chaplain
stay-at-home mom --

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.880
hardly the backgrounds
to take the research world by storm.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.160
The second barrier:

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.840
researchers don't share.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.520
People told us you can't herd cats.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.176
Well, yes you can if you move their food.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.240
(Laughter)

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.960
(Applause)

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400
DNA and clinical data is the food.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.096
So we would collect blood
and medical histories,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.696
and require that all scientists
using these resources

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.400
would share results with each other
and with the people who donated.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.296
Well before the internet
was in common use,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.176
Pat and I established PXE International,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.096
a nonprofit dedicated to initiating
research and conducting it on PXE

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600
and also supporting
individuals with the disease.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.176
Using traditional media,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.616
we garnered around
100-150 people around the world

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.896
who we asked,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.176
would you give us your blood,
your tissue, your medical histories,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400
your medical records?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.040
And we brought all of that together.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.880
We quickly learned that this shared
resource was not going to be enough.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.256
And so we decided we had
to do hardcore bench science --

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.640
hardcore research.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.720
So we borrowed bench space
at a lab at Harvard.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.976
A wonderful neighbor
came a couple times a week

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.056
and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.416
while Pat and I extracted DNA,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.176
ran and scored gels

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.480
and searched for the gene.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.720
Generous postdocs
tutored us as we went along.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.840
Within a few years, we found the gene.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.376
We patented it so that
it would be freely available.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.456
We created a diagnostic test.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.640
We put together a research consortium.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.800
We held research meetings
and opened a center of excellence.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.736
We found more than 4,000 people
around the world who had PXE,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.696
and held patient meetings

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.280
and did clinical trials and studies.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.336
Through all this,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.640
we lived with fear.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.840
Fear of the disease
breathing down our neck

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.680
while the clock ticked.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.440
Fear of researchers,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.040
so well credentialed and positioned
in a world made for them.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.360
Fear that we were making
the wrong choices.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.776
Fear that the naysayers were right

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.920
and the cats would simply find a new food.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.976
But greater than all these fears
was our drive to make a difference

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
for our kids and for all those
we had met along the way.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.496
And very quickly,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.256
we also realized what we
were doing for one disease,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.400
we should do for all diseases.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.016
We joined with, and I eventually led,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.256
Genetic Alliance --

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.576
a network of health advocacy,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.816
patient advocacy,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.480
research and health organizations.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.616
We built scalable
and extensible resources,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.456
like biobanks and registries
and directories of support

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.800
for all diseases.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.856
And as I learned about all those diseases
and all those disease communities,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.736
I realized that there were
two secrets in health care

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.560
that were impacting me greatly.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.736
The first:

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.176
there are no ready answers
for people like my kids

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.135
or all the people I was working with,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.200
whether common or rare conditions.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.159
And the second secret:

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.856
the answers lie in all of us together,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.360
donating our data,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.536
our biological samples

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.280
and ultimately ourselves.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.776
There is a small
groundswell of individuals

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.056
who are working to change this.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.136
Citizen scientists, activists, hacks

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.336
who are using crowdsourcing,
do-it-yourself science

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.560
are changing the game.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.520
Even President Obama
and Vice President Biden

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.376
are evangelists for the idea

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.880
that people should be
partners in research.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.280
This is a founding principle
of our organization.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.096
Sure, it's really hard

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.320
to discover and develop
interventions and therapies.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.816
The science is hard,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.120
the regulatory regime is difficult.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.976
There are a lot of stakeholders
with lots of interests

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.280
and misaligned incentives
like publishing, promotion and tenure.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.776
I don't fault scientists
for following this path,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.640
but I challenge them and us
to do this differently.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.560
To recognize that people
are at the center.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.176
Genetic Alliance has experimented

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.680
in what it will take
to transform these crusty systems.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.160
Our goal is to work without boundaries.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.000
That sounds abstract,
but for us it's quite practical.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.096
When we're frustrated
that entities won't share data --

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.216
data that comes from people who gave
their energy, their time, their blood

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.760
and even their tears --

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.136
we need to stop and ask,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.280
"How is it true that we
could share, but we aren't?"

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.360
We're part of this system, too.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.560
How do we make it
so that people can share ideas freely?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.880
So that people can take risks
and move closer to one another?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.736
This leads to a dissolving
of us versus them,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.120
not only for organizations
but also for individuals.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.096
If I'm going to ask
organizations or individuals

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.336
to strive for these standards,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.240
then I too need to explore
my own being and my practices.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.376
If I'm going to ask clinicians
and researchers and administrators

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.976
to take risks,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
then I, Sharon,
need to take risks as well.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.680
I need to face my personal fears.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.560
My fear of not having enough impact.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.880
My fear of not leading well.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.920
My fear of not being enough.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.656
Just before they entered their teens,
our kids stopped us in our tracks

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.376
and said, "You have to stop worrying
about making a difference,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.656
making an impact,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.656
and instead, like us,
learn to live with disease

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.560
rather than fight it."

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.896
I have to ask,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.160
where does all my fear come from?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.080
The kids' declaration
shines a spotlight on that fear.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.840
It arises from a bedrock of love.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.480
I love Elizabeth and Ian.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.440
I love people with PXE.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.640
I love people with any disease.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.920
I love people.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.136
Some of my colleagues have discovered
that it is not death we fear,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.360
it is the enormity of our loving.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.536
This expansive love opens me to great pain

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.280
as I face loss.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.400
As I discover my fear,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.936
I discover that I

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.576
and all those around me

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.320
have boundless capacity for love.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.040
And I also discover

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.840
as I move into this fear,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.856
that I can learn many new things

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.240
and find paths

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.176
to things like practical solutions

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.360
as well as the core of healing and health.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.560
I don't fear fear the way I used to.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.696
In fact lately, with enormous support
from all my fellow journeyers,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.040
I notice that it's not a warning
the way it used to be.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.896
I notice that instead,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.816
it's an invitation to go forward

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.080
because in it lies love
and the path to greater love.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.240
If I turn with gentle curiosity
toward that fear,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.856
I find enormous wealth
within myself and others

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.200
and the ability to step into challenges
that I never thought I could.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.320
My kids are ahead of me
on that path still.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.256
At ages 29 and 27,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.736
they declare they are happy and healthy

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.880
despite having manifestations of PXE
in their skin and eyes and arteries.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.496
And so I invite you, us, we,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.096
to turn toward our fear;

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.056
to embrace the things that scare us

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.216
and find the love at the center.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.456
We'll not only find ourselves there

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.456
but we'll also be able
to step into the shoes of those we fear

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.840
and those who fear us.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.520
If we breathe into that fear

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.216
and are vulnerable with the systems
and people who challenge us,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.320
our power as changemakers
grows exponentially.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.656
And when we realize

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.336
that working on our inner life
is working on our outer life

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.096
and outer work is inner work,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.256
we get down to what is real

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.696
and shit gets done.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.176
(Laughter)

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.016
There is no limit
to what we can accomplish together.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.256
Thank you.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.840
(Applause)
