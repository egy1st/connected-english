WEBVTT

00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:04.520
My seven-year-old grandson
sleeps just down the hall from me,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:06.210
and he wakes up a lot of mornings

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:07.772
and he says,

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:10.010
"You know, this could be
the best day ever."

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.742
And other times,
in the middle of the night,

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.692
he calls out in a tremulous voice,

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.546
"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:23.640
I think this pretty much says it for me
and most of the people I know,

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.944
that we're a mixed grill
of happy anticipation

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:28.187
and dread.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.802
So I sat down a few days
before my 61st birthday,

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:37.487
and I decided to compile a list
of everything I know for sure.

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:41.140
There's so little truth
in the popular culture,

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.120
and it's good to be sure of a few things.

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:48.138
For instance, I am no longer 47,

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.625
although this is the age I feel,

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.266
and the age I like to think
of myself as being.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.527
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s

00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:01.134
that he felt like a young man
with something really wrong with him.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:05.008
(Laughter)

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.872
Our true person is outside
of time and space,

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.406
but looking at the paperwork,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.765
I can, in fact, see
that I was born in 1954.

00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:16.305
My inside self is outside
of time and space.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.374
It doesn't have an age.

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:21.747
I'm every age I've ever been,
and so are you,

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.455
although I can't help
mentioning as an aside

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.110
that it might have been helpful
if I hadn't followed

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:29.655
the skin care rules of the '60s,

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.073
which involved getting
as much sun as possible

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:35.643
while slathered in baby oil

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.914
and basking in the glow
of a tinfoil reflector shield.

00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:41.652
(Laughter)

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:44.274
It was so liberating, though,
to face the truth

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:47.646
that I was no longer
in the last throes of middle age,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.022
that I decided to write down
every single true thing I know.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:55.444
People feel really doomed
and overwhelmed these days,

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:58.190
and they keep asking me what's true.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:04.563
So I hope that my list of things
I'm almost positive about

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:07.652
might offer some basic
operating instructions

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:11.323
to anyone who is feeling
really overwhelmed or beleaguered.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.022
Number one:

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:17.707
the first and truest thing
is that all truth is a paradox.

00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.046
Life is both a precious,
unfathomably beautiful gift,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.752
and it's impossible here,
on the incarnational side of things.

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:28.396
It's been a very bad match

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.686
for those of us who were born
extremely sensitive.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.574
It's so hard and weird
that we sometimes wonder

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:36.034
if we're being punked.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:41.956
It's filled simultaneously
with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.755
desperate poverty,

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.323
floods and babies and acne and Mozart,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:49.486
all swirled together.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.080
I don't think it's an ideal system.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:55.420
(Laughter)

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.839
Number two: almost
everything will work again

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:01.204
if you unplug it for a few minutes --

00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:03.923
(Laughter)

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:07.229
(Applause)

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.976
including you.

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:14.213
Three: there is almost
nothing outside of you

00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:17.149
that will help in any kind of lasting way,

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:19.137
unless you're waiting for an organ.

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:24.896
You can't buy, achieve or date
serenity and peace of mind.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.694
This is the most horrible truth,
and I so resent it.

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.773
But it's an inside job,

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:34.615
and we can't arrange peace
or lasting improvement

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.027
for the people we love most in the world.

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.131
They have to find their own ways,

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:40.777
their own answers.

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.428
You can't run alongside
your grown children

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:49.038
with sunscreen and ChapStick
on their hero's journey.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.179
You have to release them.

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:53.598
It's disrespectful not to.

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:56.947
And if it's someone else's problem,

00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:59.271
you probably don't have
the answer, anyway.

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.487
(Laughter)

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.254
Our help is usually not very helpful.

00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:06.173
Our help is often toxic.

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:09.620
And help is the sunny side of control.

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:13.310
Stop helping so much.

00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:16.791
Don't get your help and goodness
all over everybody.

00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:19.327
(Laughter)

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.012
(Applause)

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:23.009
This brings us to number four:

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:26.917
everyone is screwed up,
broken, clingy and scared,

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:29.916
even the people who seem
to have it most together.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.379
They are much more like you
than you would believe,

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:37.051
so try not to compare your insides
to other people's outsides.

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.941
It will only make you worse
than you already are.

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:42.957
(Laughter)

00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:47.743
Also, you can't save, fix
or rescue any of them

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:49.802
or get anyone sober.

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:52.580
What helped me get clean
and sober 30 years ago

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:56.215
was the catastrophe
of my behavior and thinking.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.245
So I asked some sober friends for help,

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.203
and I turned to a higher power.

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:04.286
One acronym for God
is the "gift of desperation,"

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.739
G-O-D,

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:07.795
or as a sober friend put it,

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.786
by the end I was deteriorating faster
than I could lower my standards.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.121
(Laughter)

00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:21.455
So God might mean, in this case,

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.620
"me running out of any more good ideas."

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:29.698
While fixing and saving
and trying to rescue is futile,

00:05:29.722 --> 00:05:33.133
radical self-care is quantum,

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:36.773
and it radiates out from you
into the atmosphere

00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:38.442
like a little fresh air.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:41.047
It's a huge gift to the world.

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:45.581
When people respond by saying,
"Well, isn't she full of herself,"

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:48.571
just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:51.557
and make both of you a nice cup of tea.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:57.288
Being full of affection
for one's goofy, self-centered,

00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:59.805
cranky, annoying self

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.358
is home.

00:06:01.382 --> 00:06:03.414
It's where world peace begins.

00:06:05.038 --> 00:06:06.755
Number five:

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.843
chocolate with 75 percent cacao
is not actually a food.

00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:15.879
(Laughter)

00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:19.983
Its best use is as a bait in snake traps

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:24.567
or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.

00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.842
It was never meant
to be considered an edible.

00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:31.230
Number six --

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:34.758
(Laughter)

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.038
writing.

00:06:36.874 --> 00:06:41.262
Every writer you know writes
really terrible first drafts,

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.439
but they keep their butt in the chair.

00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:45.183
That's the secret of life.

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:48.407
That's probably the main difference
between you and them.

00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:49.893
They just do it.

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:52.483
They do it by prearrangement
with themselves.

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.550
They do it as a debt of honor.

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:57.630
They tell stories that come through them

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.164
one day at a time, little by little.

00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:02.414
When my older brother was in fourth grade,

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:06.412
he had a term paper on birds
due the next day,

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:08.716
and he hadn't started.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.822
So my dad sat down with him
with an Audubon book,

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.190
paper, pencils and brads --

00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:20.814
for those of you who have gotten
a little less young and remember brads --

00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:23.668
and he said to my brother,

00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:26.302
"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:28.641
Just read about pelicans

00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:32.521
and then write about pelicans
in your own voice.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:35.700
And then find out about chickadees,

00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:38.495
and tell us about them in your own voice.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.265
And then geese."

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.037
So the two most important things
about writing are: bird by bird

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.167
and really god-awful first drafts.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.634
If you don't know where to start,

00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:52.887
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours,

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.427
and you get to tell it.

00:07:54.852 --> 00:07:58.014
If people wanted you to write
more warmly about them,

00:07:58.038 --> 00:07:59.758
they should've behaved better.

00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:02.812
(Laughter)

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:05.746
(Applause)

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:10.018
You're going to feel like hell
if you wake up someday

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:11.803
and you never wrote the stuff

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:15.288
that is tugging on the sleeves
of your heart:

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:18.708
your stories, memories,
visions and songs --

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.385
your truth,

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:22.234
your version of things --

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:23.743
in your own voice.

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:26.242
That's really all you have to offer us,

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:28.720
and that's also why you were born.

00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:34.673
Seven: publication and temporary
creative successes

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:36.887
are something you have to recover from.

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:40.586
They kill as many people as not.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.140
They will hurt, damage and change you

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:45.278
in ways you cannot imagine.

00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:49.223
The most degraded
and evil people I've ever known

00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:52.356
are male writers who've had
huge best sellers.

00:08:53.093 --> 00:08:57.250
And yet, returning to number one,
that all truth is paradox,

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:59.699
it's also a miracle
to get your work published,

00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:02.559
to get your stories read and heard.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.338
Just try to bust yourself
gently of the fantasy

00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:07.816
that publication will heal you,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.924
that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy
holes inside of you.

00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:13.542
It can't.

00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:14.926
It won't.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.655
But writing can.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.277
So can singing in a choir
or a bluegrass band.

00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:23.608
So can painting community
murals or birding

00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:26.800
or fostering old dogs
that no one else will.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.621
Number eight: families.

00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:35.979
Families are hard, hard, hard,

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:39.429
no matter how cherished
and astonishing they may also be.

00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:41.579
Again, see number one.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:42.650
(Laughter)

00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:46.962
At family gatherings where you suddenly
feel homicidal or suicidal --

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.002
(Laughter)

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:50.357
remember that in all cases,

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:55.845
it's a miracle that any of us,
specifically, were conceived and born.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.447
Earth is forgiveness school.

00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.581
It begins with forgiving yourself,

00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.879
and then you might as well
start at the dinner table.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.285
That way, you can do this work
in comfortable pants.

00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:11.255
(Laughter)

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.226
When William Blake said that we are here

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.238
to learn to endure the beams of love,

00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:19.595
he knew that your family would be
an intimate part of this,

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.313
even as you want to run screaming
for your cute little life.

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.370
But I promise you are up to it.

00:10:26.394 --> 00:10:29.774
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,

00:10:29.798 --> 00:10:31.823
and you will be amazed.

00:10:33.164 --> 00:10:34.957
Nine: food.

00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:38.725
Try to do a little better.

00:10:39.497 --> 00:10:41.387
I think you know what I mean.

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:45.056
(Laughter)

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.310
Number 10 --

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:54.558
(Laughter)

00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:55.767
grace.

00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:59.535
Grace is spiritual WD-40,

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.039
or water wings.

00:11:01.063 --> 00:11:07.030
The mystery of grace is that God loves
Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin

00:11:07.054 --> 00:11:08.213
and me

00:11:08.237 --> 00:11:12.593
exactly as much as He or She
loves your new grandchild.

00:11:12.988 --> 00:11:14.205
Go figure.

00:11:14.229 --> 00:11:16.006
(Laughter)

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.367
The movement of grace
is what changes us, heals us

00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:21.389
and heals our world.

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:25.184
To summon grace, say, "Help,"
and then buckle up.

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:27.898
Grace finds you exactly where you are,

00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:30.447
but it doesn't leave you
where it found you.

00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:33.567
And grace won't look
like Casper the Friendly Ghost,

00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.196
regrettably.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.603
But the phone will ring
or the mail will come

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:39.107
and then against all odds,

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.110
you'll get your sense of humor
about yourself back.

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.890
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.566
It helps us breathe again and again

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.723
and gives us back to ourselves,

00:11:51.747 --> 00:11:55.484
and this gives us faith
in life and each other.

00:11:56.495 --> 00:12:00.473
And remember -- grace always bats last.

00:12:01.652 --> 00:12:04.761
Eleven: God just means goodness.

00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:07.226
It's really not all that scary.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.700
It means the divine or a loving,
animating intelligence,

00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:15.449
or, as we learned
from the great "Deteriorata,"

00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.081
"the cosmic muffin."

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.719
A good name for God is: "Not me."

00:12:21.827 --> 00:12:24.573
Emerson said that
the happiest person on Earth

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:28.775
is the one who learns from nature
the lessons of worship.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.925
So go outside a lot and look up.

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:36.452
My pastor said you can trap bees
on the bottom of mason jars without lids

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:38.189
because they don't look up,

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:42.613
so they just walk around bitterly
bumping into the glass walls.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.005
Go outside. Look up.

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:46.396
Secret of life.

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.341
And finally: death.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:51.653
Number 12.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.423
Wow and yikes.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.600
It's so hard to bear when the few people
you cannot live without die.

00:12:59.624 --> 00:13:03.261
You'll never get over these losses,
and no matter what the culture says,

00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:05.152
you're not supposed to.

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:10.319
We Christians like to think of death
as a major change of address,

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:14.929
but in any case, the person
will live again fully in your heart

00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:16.945
if you don't seal it off.

00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:19.737
Like Leonard Cohen said,
"There are cracks in everything,

00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:21.614
and that's how the light gets in."

00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:25.216
And that's how we feel
our people again fully alive.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.251
Also, the people will make
you laugh out loud

00:13:31.275 --> 00:13:34.341
at the most inconvenient times,

00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.439
and that's the great good news.

00:13:36.463 --> 00:13:40.918
But their absence will also be a lifelong
nightmare of homesickness for you.

00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:45.623
Grief and friends, time and tears
will heal you to some extent.

00:13:45.647 --> 00:13:49.898
Tears will bathe and baptize
and hydrate and moisturize you

00:13:49.922 --> 00:13:52.251
and the ground on which you walk.

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:55.306
Do you know the first thing
that God says to Moses?

00:13:56.028 --> 00:13:58.522
He says, "Take off your shoes."

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:03.119
Because this is holy ground,
all evidence to the contrary.

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:06.208
It's hard to believe,
but it's the truest thing I know.

00:14:06.232 --> 00:14:10.374
When you're a little bit older,
like my tiny personal self,

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:14.204
you realize that death
is as sacred as birth.

00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:17.779
And don't worry -- get on with your life.

00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:22.900
Almost every single death
is easy and gentle

00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:25.940
with the very best people surrounding you

00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:27.807
for as long as you need.

00:14:27.831 --> 00:14:29.471
You won't be alone.

00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:34.354
They'll help you cross over
to whatever awaits us.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:36.608
As Ram Dass said,

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:38.492
"When all is said and done,

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:41.516
we're really just all walking
each other home."

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:44.612
I think that's it,

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:46.738
but if I think of anything else,

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:48.224
I'll let you know.

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:49.451
Thank you.

00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:51.054
(Applause)

00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.354
Thank you.

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:54.186
(Applause)

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.364
I was very surprised to be asked to come,

00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:59.071
because it is not my realm,

00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:01.422
technology or design or entertainment.

00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:04.627
I mean, my realm is sort of
faith and writing

00:15:04.651 --> 00:15:07.601
and kind of lurching along together.

00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:09.388
And I was surprised,

00:15:09.412 --> 00:15:13.685
but they said I could give a talk,
and I said I'd love to.

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.761
(Video) If you don't know where to start,

00:15:15.785 --> 00:15:18.910
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:20.312
and you get to tell it.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.441
Anne Lamott: People are very frightened
and feel really doomed

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:24.653
in America these days,

00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:27.818
and I just wanted to help people
get their sense of humor about it

00:15:27.842 --> 00:15:31.440
and to realize how much isn't a problem.

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:34.690
If you take an action,

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:39.102
take a really healthy or loving
or friendly action,

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:41.987
you'll have loving and friendly feelings.
