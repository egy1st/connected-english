00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:03.616
I am from the South Side of Chicago,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.736
and in seventh grade,
I had a best friend named Jenny

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.560
who lived on the Southwest
Side of Chicago.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.336
Jenny was white,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.336
and if you know anything about
the segregated demographics of Chicago,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.496
you know that there are
not too many black people

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.576
who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.856
But Jenny was my girl

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.776
and so we would hang out every so often
after school and on the weekends.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.095
And so one day we were
hanging out in her living room,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.376
talking about 13-year-old things,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.616
and Jenny's little sister Rosie
was in the room with us,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.696
and she was sitting behind me
just kind of playing in my hair,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.800
and I wasn't thinking too much
about what she was doing.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.616
But at a pause in the conversation,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.136
Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.520
She said, "Can I ask you a question?"

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880
I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure."

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.216
"Are you black?"

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.456
(Laughter)

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.376
The room froze.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Silence.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.136
Jenny and Rosie's mom
was not too far away.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.056
She was in the kitchen
and she overheard the conversation,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.600
and she was mortified.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.880
She said, "Rosie! You can't
ask people questions like that."

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.216
And Jenny was my friend,
and I know she was really embarrassed.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.576
I felt kind of bad for her,
but actually I was not offended.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.656
I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault
that in her 10 short years on this earth,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.136
living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.040
she wasn't 100 percent sure
what a black person looked like.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.856
That's fair.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.256
But what was more surprising to me was,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.776
in all of this time I had spent
with Jenny and Rosie's family --

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.136
hanging out with them,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.416
playing with them,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.216
even physically interacting with them --

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.736
it was not until Rosie
put her hands in my hair

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.280
that she thought to ask me if I was black.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.256
That was the first time I would realize

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.216
how big of a role the texture of my hair
played in confirming my ethnicity,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.840
but also that it would play a key role
in how I'm viewed by others in society.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.616
Garrett A. Morgan
and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.160
of the black hair-care and beauty
industry in the early 1900s.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.456
They're best known as the inventors
of chemically-based hair creams

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.016
and heat straightening tools

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.616
designed to permanently,
or semipermanently,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.280
alter the texture of black hair.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.136
Oftentimes when we think
about the history of blacks in America,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.056
we think about the heinous acts

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.576
and numerous injustices
that we experienced as people of color

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.336
because of the color of our skin,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.016
when in fact, in post-Civil War America,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.216
it was the hair of an
African-American male or female

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.096
that was known as the most
"telling feature" of Negro status,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.040
more so than the color of the skin.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.456
And so before they were staples

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.416
of the multibillion-dollar
hair-care industry,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.216
our dependency on tools and products,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.536
like the hair relaxer
and the pressing comb,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.976
were more about our survival
and advancement as a race

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.200
in postslavery America.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.256
Over the years,
we grew accustomed to this idea

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.400
that straighter and longer
hair meant better and more beautiful.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.936
We became culturally obsessed

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.160
with this idea of having
what we like to call ...

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.040
"good hair."

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.256
This essentially means:

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.840
the looser the curl pattern,
the better the hair.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.176
And we let these institutionalized ideas
form a false sense of hierarchy

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.776
that would determine
what was considered a good grade of hair

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.160
and what was not.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.616
What's worse is that
we let these false ideologies

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.376
invade our perception of ourselves,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.736
and they still continue
to infect our cultural identity

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.200
as African-American women today.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.216
So what did we do?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.256
We went to the hair salon
every six to eight weeks,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.656
without fail,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.016
to subject our scalps
to harsh straightening chemicals

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.976
beginning at a very young age --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.056
sometimes eight, 10 --

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.296
that would result in hair loss,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.536
bald spots,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.760
sometimes even burns on the scalp.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.216
We fry our hair at temperatures
of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.496
almost daily,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.520
to maintain the straight look.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.336
Or we simply cover our hair up
with wigs and weaves,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.016
only to let our roots breathe in private

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.160
where no one knows
what's really going on under there.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.816
We adopted these practices
in our own communities,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.176
and so it's no wonder
why today the typical ideal vision

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.936
of a professional black woman,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.856
especially in corporate America,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.200
tends to look like this,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.880
rather than like this.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
And she certainly doesn't look like this.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.296
In September of this year,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.816
a federal court ruled it lawful

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.176
for a company to discriminate
against hiring an employee

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.280
based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.776
In the case,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.056
the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.800
is on record as saying,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.800
"I'm not saying yours are messy,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.976
but ...

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.572
you know what I'm talking about."

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.680
Well, what was she talking about?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.480
Did she think that they were ugly?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.376
Or maybe they were
just a little too Afrocentric

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.680
and pro-black-looking for her taste.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.416
Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.976
and it's more just about
it being a little too "urban"

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.400
for the professional setting.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.536
Perhaps she had a genuine concern
in that they looked "scary"

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.080
and that they would intimidate
the clients and their customer base.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.776
All of these words are ones
that are too often associated

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.240
with the stigma
attached to natural hairstyles.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.200
And this ...

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.680
this has got to change.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.536
In 2013,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.056
a white paper published by the Deloitte
Leadership Center for Inclusion,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.496
studied 3,000 individuals
in executive leadership roles

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.136
on the concept
of covering in the workplace

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.240
based on appearance,
advocacy, affiliation and association.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.376
When thinking about
appearance-based covering,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.656
the study showed

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.736
that 67 percent of women
of color cover in the workplace

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.040
based on their appearance.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.816
Of the total respondents who
admitted to appearance-based covering,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.096
82 percent said that it was
somewhat to extremely important

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.120
for them to do so
for their professional advancement.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.040
Now, this is Ursula Burns.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.656
She is the first African-American
female CEO of a Fortune 500 company --

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.880
of Xerox.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.416
She's known by her signature look,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.136
the one that you see here.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.440
A short, nicely trimmed,
well-manicured Afro.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.440
Ms. Burns is what
we like to call a "natural girl."

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.616
And she is paving the way
and showing what's possible

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.376
for African-American women
seeking to climb the corporate ladder,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.240
but still wishing
to wear natural hairstyles.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.976
But today the majority
of African-American women

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.696
who we still look to as leaders,
icons and role models,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.016
still opt for a straight-hair look.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.256
Now,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.976
maybe it's because they want to --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.296
this is authentically
how they feel best --

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.816
but maybe --

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.456
and I bet --

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.736
a part of them felt like they had to

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.240
in order to reach the level of success
that they have attained today.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.536
There is a natural hair movement
that is sweeping the country

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.840
and also in some places in Europe.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.856
Millions of women are exploring what
it means to transition to natural hair,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.895
and they're cutting off
years and years of dry, damaged ends

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.111
in order to restore
their natural curl pattern.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.256
I know because I have been an advocate
and an ambassador for this movement

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.080
for roughly the last three years.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.376
After 27 years of excessive heat
and harsh chemicals,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.880
my hair was beginning to show
extreme signs of wear and tear.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.016
It was breaking off,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.416
it was thinning,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.496
looking just extremely dry and brittle.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.896
All those years of chasing
that conventional image of beauty

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.136
that we saw earlier

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.120
was finally beginning to take its toll.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.016
I wanted to do something about it,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.536
and so I started what I called
the "No Heat Challenge,"

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.416
where I would refrain
from using heat styling tools on my hair

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.720
for six months.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.776
And like a good millennial,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.016
I documented it on social media.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.296
(Laughter)

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.376
I documented as I reluctantly cut off

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.160
three to four inches of my beloved hair.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.576
I documented as I struggled
to master these natural hairstyles,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.616
and also as I struggled to embrace them

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.880
and think that they actually looked good.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.240
And I documented as my hair texture
slowly began to change.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.896
By sharing this journey openly,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.696
I learned that I was not
the only woman going through this

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.496
and that in fact there were thousands
and thousands of other women

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.240
who were longing to do the same.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.296
So they would reach out to me
and they would say,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.576
"Cheyenne, how did you do
that natural hairstyle

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.536
that I saw you with the other day?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.576
What new products have you started using

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.936
that might be a little better
for my hair texture

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.400
as it begins to change?"

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.776
Or, "What are some
of the natural hair routines

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.920
that I should begin to adopt
to slowly restore the health of my hair?"

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.856
But I also found that there were
a large number of women

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.680
who were extremely hesitant
to take that first step

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.240
because they were paralyzed by fear.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.136
Fear of the unknown --

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.760
what would they now look like?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.776
How would they feel about themselves
with these natural hairstyles?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.216
And most importantly to them,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.240
how would others view them?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.216
Over the last three years

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.136
of having numerous conversations
with friends of mine

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.096
and also complete strangers
from around the world,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.816
I learned some really important things

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.560
about how African-American women
identify with their hair.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.776
And so when I think back

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.336
to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.096
I'd say, "Actually, no.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.576
We don't know what you're talking about."

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.560
But here are some things that we do know.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.696
We know that when black women
embrace their love for their natural hair,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.176
it helps to undo generations of teaching

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.496
that black in its natural state
is not beautiful,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.440
or something to be hidden or covered up.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.736
We know that black women
express their individuality

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.856
and experience feelings of empowerment

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.920
by experimenting with different
hairstyles regularly.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.496
And we also know

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.416
that when we're invited
to wear our natural hair in the workplace,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.816
it reinforces that we are uniquely valued

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.600
and thus helps us to flourish
and advance professionally.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.720
I leave you with this.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.520
In a time of racial and social tension,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.376
embracing this movement

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.176
and others like this

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.720
help us to rise above
the confines of the status quo.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.776
So when you see a woman with braids
or locks draping down her back,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.336
or you notice your colleague

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.440
who has stopped
straightening her hair to work,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.936
do not simply approach her and admire

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.776
and ask her if you can touch it --

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.056
(Laughter)

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.920
Really appreciate her.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.136
Applaud her.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.880
Heck, even high-five her
if that's what you feel so inclined to do.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.096
Because this --

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.880
this is more than about a hairstyle.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.800
It's about self-love and self-worth.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.816
It's about being brave enough

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.880
not to fold under the pressure
of others' expectations.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.376
And about knowing that making
the decision to stray from the norm

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.856
does not define who we are,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.200
but it simply reveals who we are.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.776
And finally,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.656
being brave is easier

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.120
when we can count
on the compassion of others.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.536
So after today,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.880
I certainly hope that we can count on you.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.576
Thank you.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.652
(Applause)
