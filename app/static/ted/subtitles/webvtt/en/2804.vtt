00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:03.954
Michael Browning: engineer,

00:00:03.978 --> 00:00:05.538
innovator --

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:06.751
inventor, really --

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:08.014
and inspiring father.

00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:11.142
He had a passion for flight,
as you can kind of sense

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:15.178
from that rather dubious
1970s office-leaving present.

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.502
And some 40 years after that was created,

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.093
a small group of us got together

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.297
to have a go,

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.678
a run at the whole challenge of flight
that inspired people for years,

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:28.759
and do it in a very different kind of way.

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:31.468
And that's the journey I'd like
to share with you now.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:34.710
The starting hypothesis was one
of the human mind and body,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.128
which, as you've seen
for the last few days here,

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:38.971
is an amazing construct.

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:42.661
What if you augmented
that wonderful machine

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.163
with just the right technology?

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.522
If you approach flight
in that kind of real way,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.798
where could you get to?

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:51.189
So my training partner here
back in London, Denton,

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:54.217
is doing a much better job
of that kind of stuff than me.

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.901
Guess what? It's London.

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.589
The idea was that you augment that.

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.167
And so, how do you augment that?

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.685
Well, we bought one of these.

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:05.127
This is a micro gas turbine.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.768
This was ground zero,

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.941
so that little piece of kit
proved really quite impressive,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.877
so we got two in a field.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.851
The real hero here, by the way,
is, right in the background,

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.784
there's a lady tending some vegetables,

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.825
who does a brilliant job
of trying to ignore us for a while --

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.664
(Laughter)

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.234
I think the only thing
less happy is the grass,

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:30.710
that we did probably damage quite badly.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.420
You get an idea of the thrust here,

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:35.070
when I try to hold them horizontally
and somewhat fail.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.968
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:39.071
We were quite impressed with that.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:40.937
We thought we were getting somewhere.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.498
So there's only one sensible way
to go from there:

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:45.563
you get four.

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:47.444
(Laughter)

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.054
I have to say, I still like
watching these back.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:56.083
So then we thought well, let's try
and spread the load a bit.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.999
The legs are designed to take the load,

00:01:58.023 --> 00:01:59.982
so why don't we spread it out a bit?

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.538
That bit was good.

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:04.397
The harness --

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:06.322
a nice idea but it didn't really work,

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:07.802
as you'll see now.

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:10.874
This whole journey was very much
about trying things --

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:11.972
(Laughter)

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.795
Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.571
Trying things and learning
by failing at them most of the time.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:21.956
And that included failing by falling over.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.027
If you notice, we've got
five engines here --

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.614
not to be put off by the fact
one was in maintenance,

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:28.793
still had a go.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:29.824
(Laughter)

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.511
And then I pinched a fuel line.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.261
So again, good learning.
We learned not to do that again.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.485
This was a blind alley.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:37.536
(Laughter)

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.121
This was three on each arm --

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:40.311
that was ridiculous.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:42.296
That was 70 kilos on each arm.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.913
Again, struck that one off.

00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:45.584
(Laughter)

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:49.070
But we were starting to make
some really quite convincing progress,

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:51.428
just enough to make you
believe that maybe --

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:52.757
maybe we could get there.

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:55.107
You can see, look -- tantalizing.

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:59.436
The model of one on each leg
and two on each arm,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.170
on paper, that was enough thrust.

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:04.844
And then we did what
I'm about to show you now,

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:07.030
and I still love watching this one.

00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:14.248
This was our first six-second,
reasonably coherent flight.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.504
(Applause)

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.005
That was the point where
this endeavor went from:

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.115
"I'm really not sure
this is going to work,"

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.640
to: "Oh my god, it does work!"

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.259
From there on we then refined it,

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.146
but we carried on falling over a lot.

00:03:31.093 --> 00:03:34.180
Falling over, like I say, is definitely
the best way to learn.

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:37.902
After a while, we starting
really refining the layout of all of this.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.259
And you'll see,
that's stability and control --

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.113
there's no wires there or anything --

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.571
that's a combination of us
refining the technology,

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:47.798
including with a Tupperware box
on the back for the electronics

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.233
and actually learning
the balance and control.

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:54.726
I'm now going to save your ears
for the next short piece

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.909
and talk over it.

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:58.516
After a while, the jet engine
noise is a bit annoying.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.942
This is only a few weeks ago.

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.891
You can see the stability and control
is really quite nice,

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.365
and I'd like to think this somewhat
validates that starting hypothesis,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.101
that the human mind and body,
if properly augmented in that way,

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.911
can achieve some pretty cool stuff.

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:14.508
I mean, like I said:

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:17.496
I'm not thinking about where
I'm moving my arms at that stage.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.554
I'm looking at the objective
of where I want to get to,

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:22.377
and a bit like riding a bike,

00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:24.203
my arms are just doing their thing.

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:25.792
It's a very strange experience.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:27.492
So where is all this headed?

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.252
I'll talk over this landing --

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.296
I think I land in this one.

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:34.586
Well, I don't think anybody's going
to go down to Walmart

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.495
or take the kids to school
in any of this stuff for a while,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.385
but the team at Gravity are building
some awesome technology

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.725
that's going to make
this look like child's play.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.098
We're working on some things

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:46.856
that will seek to bring
this unusual experience of flight

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.922
to a wider audience, beyond the events
and displays we're doing.

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:52.428
We're even starting to look
for pilots two and three,

00:04:52.452 --> 00:04:53.697
if there's any volunteers.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:54.919
I've got this vision.

00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:57.571
It sounds audacious,
but let's just stick it out there,

00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.873
that one day maybe we can
rise up above a beach,

00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:02.619
fly up and down the coastline
of it, rise up a bit higher,

00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:05.911
with some of the safety kit
we're working on to make this achievable.

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:08.661
Then over the horizon comes
a Hercules with the ramp down.

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:10.750
As it comes past,
you start picking up speed

00:05:10.774 --> 00:05:12.229
and see if we can intercept --

00:05:12.253 --> 00:05:14.903
from the rear, not the front,
that would be a mistake --

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.561
and then try and land in the back.

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.570
And as I say, that's a little
way off at the moment.

00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:23.514
But this is also, if I take
a big step back from this,

00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:26.125
this is also a very
personal journey for me.

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.149
Back to that lovely photo,

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.338
or photo in a picture.

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:34.255
Sadly, my father took
his own life when I was 15,

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.247
and left an awful lot
of unfulfilled ambition.

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.895
He was a wonderful inventor,

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.300
a maverick creator.

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:43.266
And I'd just like to think,
if it was possible,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.606
if he was looking down,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.811
he would be --

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:48.852
he'd certainly be smiling at some
of the things we've done here,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.034
I think.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.339
So, it's a tribute to him.

00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:52.536
Thank you very much.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.256
(Applause)

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.771
(Voice-over) Richard Browning:
I'm probably more nervous

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:00.333
about doing the demo after this.

00:06:00.357 --> 00:06:02.377
I've got a lot of things
to get done today.

00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:04.690
Worst-case scenario,
we don't get a clean start.

00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:07.934
Or we get an unplanned failure
while I'm actually flying around.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.560
This is why we keep it very low,

00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:13.071
so the worst is I just look like an idiot
and fall on my rear, as I said.

00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:15.106
So you can all enjoy that if that happens.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.439
(Music)

00:06:36.174 --> 00:06:38.950
(Jet engine accelerates)

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.399
(Cheers)
