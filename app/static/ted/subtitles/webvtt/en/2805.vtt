00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.336
I'm going to speak to you
about the global refugee crisis

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.176
and my aim is to show you that this crisis

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.800
is manageable, not unsolvable,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.256
but also show you that this is
as much about us and who we are

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.520
as it is a trial of the refugees
on the front line.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.136
For me, this is not
just a professional obligation,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.096
because I run an NGO supporting refugees
and displaced people around the world.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.320
It's personal.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.120
I love this picture.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.016
That really handsome guy on the right,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.240
that's not me.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.336
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.160
with his father Samuel.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.416
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.760
They fled the day the Nazis invaded.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.034
And I love this picture, too.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.800
It's a group of refugee children

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.160
arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.080
And in the middle is my mother, Marion.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.656
She was sent to start a new life

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.176
in a new country

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.456
on her own

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.920
at the age of 12.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.536
I know this:

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.816
if Britain had not admitted refugees

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.040
in the 1940s,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.880
I certainly would not be here today.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.360
Yet 70 years on,
the wheel has come full circle.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.856
The sound is of walls being built,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.376
vengeful political rhetoric,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080
humanitarian values and principles on fire

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.656
in the very countries
that 70 years ago said never again

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.320
to statelessness and hopelessness
for the victims of war.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.280
Last year, every minute,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.656
24 more people were displaced
from their homes

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.200
by conflict, violence and persecution:

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.856
another chemical weapon attack in Syria,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.336
the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.639
girls driven from their school
in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.296
These are not people
moving to another country

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.560
to get a better life.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.960
They're fleeing for their lives.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.280
It's a real tragedy

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.680
that the world's most famous refugee
can't come to speak to you here today.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.960
Many of you will know this picture.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.416
It shows the lifeless body

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.536
of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.016
a Syrian refugee who died
in the Mediterranean in 2015.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.440
He died alongside 3,700 others
trying to get to Europe.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.000
The next year, 2016,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.080
5,000 people died.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.040
It's too late for them,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.976
but it's not too late
for millions of others.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.048
It's not too late
for people like Frederick.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.136
I met him in the Nyarugusu
refugee camp in Tanzania.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.360
He's from Burundi.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.296
He wanted to know
where could he complete his studies.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.416
He'd done 11 years of schooling.
He wanted a 12th year.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.056
He said to me, "I pray
that my days do not end here

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.280
in this refugee camp."

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.480
And it's not too late for Halud.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.176
Her parents were Palestinian refugees

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000
living in the Yarmouk refugee camp
outside Damascus.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.006
She was born to refugee parents,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.800
and now she's a refugee
herself in Lebanon.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.160
She's working for the International
Rescue Committee to help other refugees,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.816
but she has no certainty at all

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.976
about her future,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.680
where it is or what it holds.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.296
This talk is about Frederick, about Halud

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.720
and about millions like them:

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.256
why they're displaced,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.720
how they survive, what help they need
and what our responsibilities are.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.240
I truly believe this,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.000
that the biggest question
in the 21st century

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.800
concerns our duty to strangers.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.576
The future "you" is about your duties

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.800
to strangers.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.816
You know better than anyone,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.640
the world is more connected
than ever before,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.416
yet the great danger

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.959
is that we're consumed by our divisions.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.256
And there is no better test of that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.240
than how we treat refugees.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.776
Here are the facts: 65 million people

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.016
displaced from their homes
by violence and persecution last year.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.776
If it was a country,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.080
that would be the 21st
largest country in the world.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.776
Most of those people, about 40 million,
stay within their own home country,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.376
but 25 million are refugees.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
That means they cross a border
into a neighboring state.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.136
Most of them are living in poor countries,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.176
relatively poor or lower-middle-income
countries, like Lebanon,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.480
where Halud is living.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.840
In Lebanon, one
in four people is a refugee,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.816
a quarter of the whole population.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.936
And refugees stay for a long time.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.056
The average length of displacement

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.280
is 10 years.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.680
I went to what was the world's
largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.296
It's called Dadaab.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.456
It was built in 1991-92

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.400
as a "temporary camp"
for Somalis fleeing the civil war.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.120
I met Silo.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.536
And naÃ¯vely I said to Silo,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760
"Do you think you'll ever
go home to Somalia?"

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.840
And she said, "What do you mean, go home?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.520
I was born here."

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.816
And then when I asked the camp management

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.896
how many of the 330,000 people
in that camp were born there,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.120
they gave me the answer:

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.680
100,000.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.240
That's what long-term displacement means.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.896
Now, the causes of this are deep:

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.159
weak states that can't
support their own people,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.256
an international political system

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.560
weaker than at any time since 1945

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.416
and differences over theology, governance,
engagement with the outside world

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.600
in significant parts of the Muslim world.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.856
Now, those are long-term,
generational challenges.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.360
That's why I say that this refugee crisis
is a trend and not a blip.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.896
And it's complex, and when you have
big, large, long-term, complex problems,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800
people think nothing can be done.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.240
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.936
off the coast of Italy, in 2014,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.256
he accused all of us
and the global population

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.720
of what he called
"the globalization of indifference."

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.976
It's a haunting phrase.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.440
It means that our hearts
have turned to stone.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.376
Now, I don't know, you tell me.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.280
Are you allowed to argue with the Pope,
even at a TED conference?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.296
But I think it's not right.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.416
I think people do want
to make a difference,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.136
but they just don't know whether
there are any solutions to this crisis.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.976
And what I want to tell you today

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.108
is that though the problems are real,
the solutions are real, too.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.136
Solution one:

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.736
these refugees need to get into work
in the countries where they're living,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.016
and the countries where they're living
need massive economic support.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.920
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.576
80 percent of refugees
in the capital city Kampala

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.336
needed no humanitarian aid
because they were working.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.789
They were supported into work.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.176
Solution number two:

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.256
education for kids
is a lifeline, not a luxury,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.920
when you're displaced for so long.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.576
Kids can bounce back when they're given
the proper social, emotional support

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.336
alongside literacy and numeracy.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.560
I've seen it for myself.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.016
But half of the world's refugee children
of primary school age

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.016
get no education at all,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.416
and three-quarters of secondary school age
get no education at all.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.640
That's crazy.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.256
Solution number three:

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.736
most refugees are in urban areas,
in cities, not in camps.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.416
What would you or I want
if we were a refugee in a city?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.440
We would want money
to pay rent or buy clothes.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.776
That is the future
of the humanitarian system,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.176
or a significant part of it:

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.856
give people cash so that
you boost the power of refugees

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.856
and you'll help the local economy.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.856
And there's a fourth solution, too,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.616
that's controversial
but needs to be talked about.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.136
The most vulnerable refugees
need to be given a new start

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.240
and a new life in a new country,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.320
including in the West.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.640
The numbers are relatively small,
hundreds of thousands, not millions,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.000
but the symbolism is huge.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.576
Now is not the time
to be banning refugees,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.416
as the Trump administration proposes.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.640
It's a time to be embracing people
who are victims of terror.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.376
And remember --

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.960
(Applause)

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.216
Remember, anyone who asks you,
"Are they properly vetted?"

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.440
that's a really sensible
and good question to ask.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.416
The truth is, refugees
arriving for resettlement

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.096
are more vetted than any other population
arriving in our countries.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.256
So while it's reasonable
to ask the question,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.160
it's not reasonable to say that refugee
is another word for terrorist.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.336
Now, what happens --

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.736
(Applause)

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.896
What happens when refugees can't get work,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.776
they can't get their kids into school,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.856
they can't get cash,
they can't get a legal route to hope?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.960
What happens is they take risky journeys.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.176
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful
Greek island, two years ago.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.056
It's a home to 90,000 people.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.560
In one year, 500,000 refugees
went across the island.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.056
And I want to show you what I saw

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.416
when I drove across
to the north of the island:

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.920
a pile of life jackets
of those who had made it to shore.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.416
And when I looked closer,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.896
there were small
life jackets for children,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.296
yellow ones.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.560
And I took this picture.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.616
You probably can't see the writing,
but I want to read it for you.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.710
"Warning: will not
protect against drowning."

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.480
So in the 21st century,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.696
children are being given life jackets

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.856
to reach safety in Europe

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.216
even though those jackets
will not save their lives

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.840
if they fall out of the boat
that is taking them there.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.200
This is not just a crisis, it's a test.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.680
It's a test that civilizations
have faced down the ages.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.120
It's a test of our humanity.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.296
It's a test of us in the Western world

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.520
of who we are and what we stand for.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.800
It's a test of our character,
not just our policies.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.136
And refugees are a hard case.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.480
They do come from faraway
parts of the world.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.600
They have been through trauma.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.176
They're often of a different religion.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.376
Those are precisely the reasons
we should be helping refugees,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.840
not a reason not to help them.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.600
And it's a reason to help them
because of what it says about us.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.320
It's revealing of our values.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.080
Empathy and altruism are two
of the foundations of civilization.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.736
Turn that empathy and altruism into action

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.000
and we live out a basic moral credo.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.216
And in the modern world,
we have no excuse.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.336
We can't say we don't know
what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.936
or Aleppo, Syria.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.856
It's there, in our smartphone

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.256
in our hand.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.856
Ignorance is no excuse at all.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.280
Fail to help, and we show
we have no moral compass at all.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.160
It's also revealing about
whether we know our own history.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.456
The reason that refugees
have rights around the world

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.256
is because of extraordinary
Western leadership

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.616
by statesmen and women
after the Second World War

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.600
that became universal rights.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.280
Trash the protections of refugees,
and we trash our own history.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.616
This is --

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.336
(Applause)

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.376
This is also revealing
about the power of democracy

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.656
as a refuge from dictatorship.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.880
How many politicians have you heard say,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.080
"We believe in the power of our example,
not the example of our power."

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.280
What they mean is what we stand for
is more important than the bombs we drop.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.160
Refugees seeking sanctuary

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.640
have seen the West as a source
of hope and a place of haven.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.640
Russians, Iranians,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.776
Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.400
they've come to the West for safety.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.160
We throw that away at our peril.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.376
And there's one other thing
it reveals about us:

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.734
whether we have any humility
for our own mistakes.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.176
I'm not one of these people

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.536
who believes that all the problems
in the world are caused by the West.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.776
They're not.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.160
But when we make mistakes,
we should recognize it.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.376
It's not an accident
that the country which has taken

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.656
more refugees than any other,
the United States,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.960
has taken more refugees from Vietnam
than any other country.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.160
It speaks to the history.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.880
But there's more recent history,
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.296
You can't make up
for foreign policy errors

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.896
by humanitarian action,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.816
but when you break something,
you have a duty to try to help repair it,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.120
and that's our duty now.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.656
Do you remember
at the beginning of the talk,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.176
I said I wanted to explain
that the refugee crisis

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.840
was manageable, not insoluble?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.656
That's true. I want you
to think in a new way,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.400
but I also want you to do things.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.856
If you're an employer,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.080
hire refugees.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.256
If you're persuaded by the arguments,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.776
take on the myths

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.040
when family or friends
or workmates repeat them.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.696
If you've got money, give it to charities

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.496
that make a difference
for refugees around the world.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.720
If you're a citizen,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.376
vote for politicians

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.016
who will put into practice
the solutions that I've talked about.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.256
(Applause)

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.456
The duty to strangers

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.456
shows itself

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.016
in small ways and big,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.760
prosaic and heroic.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.200
In 1942,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.976
my aunt and my grandmother
were living in Brussels

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.280
under German occupation.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.600
They received a summons

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.200
from the Nazi authorities
to go to Brussels Railway Station.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.360
My grandmother immediately thought
something was amiss.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.216
She pleaded with her relatives

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.360
not to go to Brussels Railway Station.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.800
Her relatives said to her,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.216
"If we don't go,
if we don't do what we're told,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.907
then we're going to be in trouble."

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.696
You can guess what happened

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.244
to the relatives who went
to Brussels Railway Station.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.446
They were never seen again.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.800
But my grandmother and my aunt,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.256
they went to a small village

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.640
south of Brussels

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.256
where they'd been on holiday
in the decade before,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.936
and they presented themselves
at the house of the local farmer,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.040
a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.880
and they asked him to take them in.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.536
And he did,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.280
and by the end of the war,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.520
17 Jews, I was told,
were living in that village.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.336
And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.400
"Can you take me to meet
Monsieur Maurice?"

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.616
And she said, "Yeah, I can.
He's still alive. Let's go and see him."

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.440
And so, it must have been '83, '84,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.696
we went to see him.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.536
And I suppose, like only a teenager could,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.816
when I met him,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.296
he was this white-haired gentleman,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.520
I said to him,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.360
"Why did you do it?

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.160
Why did you take that risk?"

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.976
And he looked at me and he shrugged,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.520
and he said, in French,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.576
"On doit."

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.800
"One must."

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.520
It was innate in him.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.376
It was natural.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.616
And my point to you is it should be
natural and innate in us, too.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.840
Tell yourself,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.576
this refugee crisis is manageable,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.176
not unsolvable,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.520
and each one of us

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.216
has a personal responsibility
to help make it so.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.416
Because this is about the rescue
of us and our values

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.296
as well as the rescue
of refugees and their lives.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.616
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.760
(Applause)

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.976
Bruno Giussani: David, thank you.
David Miliband: Thank you.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.576
BG: Those are strong suggestions

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.776
and your call for individual
responsibility is very strong as well,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.016
but I'm troubled
by one thought, and it's this:

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.056
you mentioned, and these are your words,
"extraordinary Western leadership"

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.936
which led 60-something years ago

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.016
to the whole discussion
about human rights,

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.760
to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.616
That leadership
happened after a big trauma

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.616
and happened in
a consensual political space,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.776
and now we are
in a divisive political space.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.536
Actually, refugees have become
one of the divisive issues.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.520
So where will leadership come from today?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.616
DM: Well, I think that you're right to say

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.040
that the leadership forged in war

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.016
has a different temper
and a different tempo

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.296
and a different outlook

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.000
than leadership forged in peace.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.296
And so my answer would be
the leadership has got to come from below,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.776
not from above.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.136
I mean, a recurring theme
of the conference this week

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.976
has been about
the democratization of power.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.176
And we've got to preserve
our own democracies,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.696
but we've got to also activate
our own democracies.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.536
And when people say to me,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.416
"There's a backlash against refugees,"

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.696
what I say to them is,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.816
"No, there's a polarization,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.056
and at the moment,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080
those who are fearful
are making more noise

00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:02.616
than those who are proud."

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.616
And so my answer to your question
is that we will sponsor and encourage

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.416
and give confidence to leadership

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.216
when we mobilize ourselves.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.536
And I think that when you are
in a position of looking for leadership,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.896
you have to look inside

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.616
and mobilize in your own community

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.856
to try to create conditions
for a different kind of settlement.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.096
BG: Thank you, David.
Thanks for coming to TED.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.520
(Applause)
