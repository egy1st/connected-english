00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.336
I just want to share with you

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.936
what I have been experiencing
over the last five years

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.256
in having the great privilege of traveling

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.496
to many of the poorest
countries in the world.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.416
This scene is one
I see all the time everywhere,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.576
and these young children
are looking at a smartphone,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.440
and the smartphone is having a huge impact
in even the poorest countries.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.736
I said to my team, you know,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.496
what I see is a rise in aspirations
all over the world.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.200
In fact, it seems to me
that there's a convergence of aspirations.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.336
And I asked a team of economists
to actually look into this.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.576
Is this true?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.416
Are aspirations converging
all around the world?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.696
So they looked at things like Gallup polls
about satisfaction in life

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.176
and what they learned was
that if you have access to the internet,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.296
your satisfaction goes up.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.720
But another thing happens
that's very important:

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.096
your reference income,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.776
the income to which you compare your own,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.256
also goes up.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.696
Now, if the reference income
of a nation, for example,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.096
goes up 10 percent

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.336
by comparing themselves to the outside,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.616
then on average,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.696
people's own incomes
have to go up at least five percent

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.256
to maintain the same
level of satisfaction.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.256
But when you get down
into the lower percentiles of income,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.496
your income has to go up much more

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.576
if the reference income
goes up 10 percent,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.176
something like 20 percent.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.696
And so with this rise of aspirations,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.536
the fundamental question is:

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.136
Are we going to have a situation

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.336
where aspirations
are linked to opportunity

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.096
and you get dynamism and economic growth,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.856
like that which happened
in the country I was born in, in Korea?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.120
Or are aspirations
going to meet frustration?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.600
This is a real concern,
because between 2012 and 2015,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.336
terrorism incidents
increased by 74 percent.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.616
The number of deaths from terrorism
went up 150 percent.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.496
Right now, two billion people

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.096
live in conditions
of fragility, conflict, violence,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.576
and by 2030, more than 60 percent
of the world's poor

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
will live in these situations
of fragility, conflict and violence.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.496
And so what do we do
about meeting these aspirations?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.216
Are there new ways of thinking

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.256
about how we can rise
to meet these aspirations?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.296
Because if we don't,
I'm extremely worried.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.656
Aspirations are rising as never before
because of access to the internet.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.176
Everyone knows how everyone else lives.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.096
Has our ability to meet those aspirations

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.536
risen as well?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.496
And just to get at the details of this,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.936
I want to share with you
my own personal story.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.976
This is not my mother,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.696
but during the Korean War,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.176
my mother literally took her own sister,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.096
her younger sister, on her back,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.536
and walked at least part of the way

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.440
to escape Seoul during the Korean War.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.176
Now, through a series of miracles,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.296
my mother and father both got
scholarships to go to New York City.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.936
They actually met in New York City
and got married in New York City.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.176
My father, too, was a refugee.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.576
At the age of 19, he left his family
in the northern part of the country,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.256
escaped through the border

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.960
and never saw his family again.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.776
Now, when they were married
and living in New York,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.736
my father was a waiter
at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.400
Their aspirations went up.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.856
They understood what it was like
to live in a place like New York City

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.080
in the 1950s.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.816
Well, my brother was born
and they came back to Korea,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.856
and we had what I remember
as kind of an idyllic life,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.336
but what was happening
in Korea at that time

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.536
was the country was one
of the poorest in the world

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.176
and there was political upheaval.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.736
There were demonstrations just down
the street from our house all the time,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.800
students protesting
against the military government.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.840
And at the time,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.136
the aspirations of the World Bank Group,
the organization I lead now,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.600
were extremely low for Korea.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.056
Their idea was that Korea would
find it difficult without foreign aid

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.960
to provide its people with more
than the bare necessities of life.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.936
So the situation is
Korea is in a tough position,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.816
my parents have seen
what life is like in the United States.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.216
They got married there.
My brother was born there.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.576
And they felt that in order
to give us an opportunity

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.176
to reach their aspirations for us,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.536
we had to go and come back
to the United States.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.856
Now, we came back.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.136
First we went to Dallas.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.856
My father did his dental degree
all over again.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.176
And then we ended up
moving to Iowa, of all places.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.936
We grew up in Iowa.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.336
And in Iowa, we went
through the whole course.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.816
I went to high school, I went to college.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.896
And then one day,
something that I'll never forget,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.656
my father picked me up
after my sophomore year in college,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.016
and he was driving me home,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.176
and he said, "Jim,
what are your aspirations?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.616
What do you want to study?
What do you want to do?"

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.856
And I said, "Dad," --

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.136
My mother actually was a philosopher,
and had filled us with ideas

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.496
about protest and social justice,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.176
and I said, "Dad, I'm going to study
political science and philosophy,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.760
and I'm going to become
part of a political movement."

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.976
My father, the Korean dentist,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.496
slowly pulled the car
over to the side of the road --

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.176
(Laughter)

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.896
He looked back at me, and he said,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.397
"Jim, you finish your medical residency,
you can study anything you want."

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.976
(Laughter)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.936
Now, I've told this story
to a mostly Asian audience before.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.496
Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.736
Of course.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.616
(Laughter)

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.176
(Applause)

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.216
So, tragically,
my father died at a young age,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.696
30 years ago at the age of 57,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.216
what happens to be how old I am right now,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.456
and when he died in the middle
of my medical and graduate studies --

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.896
You see, I actually got around it
by doing medicine and anthropology.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.760
I studied both of them in graduate school.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.816
But then right about that time,
I met these two people,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.440
Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.976
And Paul and I were in the same program.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.576
We were studying medicine

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.336
and at the same time
getting our PhD's in anthropology.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.176
And we began to ask
some pretty fundamental questions.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.096
For people who have the great privilege
of studying medicine and anthropology --

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.256
I had come from parents who were refugees.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.736
Paul grew up literally
in a bus in a swamp in Florida.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.336
He liked to call himself "white trash."

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.256
And so we had this opportunity

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.496
and we said,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.976
what is it that we need to do?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.736
Given our ridiculously
elaborate educations,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.096
what is the nature
of our responsibility to the world?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.376
And we decided that we needed
to start an organization.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.896
It's called Partners in Health.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.176
And by the way,
there's a movie made about that.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.056
(Applause)

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.296
There's a movie
that was just a brilliant movie

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.416
they made about it
called "Bending the Arc."

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.856
It launched at Sundance this past January.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.096
Jeff Skoll is here.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.056
Jeff is one of the ones
who made it happen.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.896
And we began to think
about what it would take for us

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.496
to actually have our aspirations
reach the level

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.776
of some of the poorest
communities in the world.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.976
This is my very first visit
to Haiti in 1988,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.336
and in 1988, we elaborated
a sort of mission statement,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.216
which is we are going to make
a preferential option for the poor

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.456
in health.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.016
Now, it took us a long time, and we
were graduate students in anthropology.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.656
We were reading up one side of Marx
and down the other.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.136
Habermas. Fernand Braudel.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.816
We were reading everything

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.896
and we had to come to a conclusion
of how are we going to structure our work?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.776
So "O for the P," we called it,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.880
a preferential option for the poor.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.616
The most important thing
about a preferential option for the poor

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.880
is what it's not.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.616
It's not a preferential option
for your own sense of heroism.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.096
It's not a preferential option

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.696
for your own idea about
how to lift the poor out of poverty.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.616
It's not a preferential option
for your own organization.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.536
And the hardest of all,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.400
it's not a preferential option
for your poor.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.920
It's a preferential option for the poor.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.856
So what do you do?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.736
Well, Haiti, we started building --

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.016
Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.720
is just focus on vaccination
and maybe a feeding program.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.680
But what the Haitians wanted
was a hospital.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.256
They wanted schools.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.136
They wanted to provide their children
with the opportunities

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.176
that they'd been hearing about
from others, relatives, for example,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.096
who had gone to the United States.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.720
They wanted the same kinds
of opportunities as my parents did.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.520
I recognized them.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.336
And so that's what we did.
We built hospitals.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.176
We provided education.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.616
And we did everything we could
to try to give them opportunities.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.296
Now, my experience really became intense

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.576
at Partners in Health
in this community, Carabayllo,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.440
in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.416
And in this community,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.056
we started out by really just going
to people's homes and talking to people,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.336
and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic
of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.616
This is Melquiades.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.456
Melquiades was a patient at that time,
he was about 18 years old,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.360
and he had a very difficult form
of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.056
All of the gurus in the world,
the global health gurus,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.896
said it is not cost-effective
to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.873
It's too complicated. It's too expensive.

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:29.736
You just can't do it. It can't be done.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.936
And in addition,
they were getting angry at us,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.496
because the implication was

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.896
if it could be done,
we would have done it.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.616
Who do you think you are?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.896
And the people that we fought with
were the World Health Organization

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.056
and probably the organization
we fought with most

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.616
was the World Bank Group.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.856
Now, we did everything we could

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.296
to convince Melquiades
to take his medicines,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.816
because it's really hard,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.696
and not once during the time of treatment
did Melquiades's family ever say,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.936
"Hey, you know, Melquiades
is just not cost-effective.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.096
Why don't you go on
and treat somebody else?"

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.416
(Laughter)

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.696
I hadn't seen Melquiades
for about 10 years

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.816
and when we had
our annual meetings in Lima, Peru

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.376
a couple of years ago,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.616
the filmmakers found him

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.576
and here is us getting together.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.320
(Applause)

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.056
He has become a bit of a media star
because he goes to the film openings,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.376
and he knows how to work an audience now.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.256
(Laughter)

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.416
But as soon as we won --

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.256
We did win. We won the argument.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.136
You should treat
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis --

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.600
we heard the same arguments
in the early 2000s about HIV.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.016
All of the leading global health
people in the world said

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.296
it is impossible
to treat HIV in poor countries.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.776
Too expensive, too complicated,
you can't do it.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.736
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.960
it's actually easier.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.656
And we were seeing patients like this.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.896
Joseph Jeune.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.336
Joseph Jeune also never mentioned
that he was not cost-effective.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.176
A few months of medicines,
and this is what he looked like.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.616
(Applause)

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.136
We call that the Lazarus Effect
of HIV treatment.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.456
Joseline came to us looking like this.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.736
This is what she looked like
a few months later.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.456
(Applause)

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.056
Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.056
was with the organizations
that kept saying it's not cost-effective.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.496
We were saying, no,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.416
preferential option for the poor
requires us to raise our aspirations

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.393
to meet those of the poor for themselves.

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:36.056
And they said, well, that's a nice thought
but it's just not cost-effective.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:42.616
So in the nerdy way
that we have operated Partners in Health,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.336
we wrote a book against,
basically, the World Bank.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.976
It says that because the World Bank

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.856
has focused so much
on just economic growth

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.656
and said that governments
have to shrink their budgets

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.736
and reduce expenditures
in health, education and social welfare --

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.736
we thought that was fundamentally wrong.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.616
And we argued with the World Bank.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.240
And then a crazy thing happened.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.936
President Obama nominated me
to be President of the World Bank.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.720
(Applause)

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.776
Now, when I went to do the vetting process
with President Obama's team,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.296
they had a copy of "Dying For Growth,"
and they had read every page.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.056
And I said, "OK, that's it, right?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.616
You guys are going to drop me?"

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.056
He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK."

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.456
And I was nominated,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.096
and I walked through the door
of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.496
and that statement on the wall,
"Our dream is a world free of poverty."

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.496
A few months after that,
we actually turned it into a goal:

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.136
end extreme poverty by 2030,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.416
boost shared prosperity.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.616
That's what we do now
at the World Bank Group.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.616
I feel like I have brought
the preferential option for the poor

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.016
to the World Bank Group.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.520
(Applause)

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.736
But this is TED,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.336
and so I want to share
with you some concerns,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.520
and then make a proposal.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.656
The Fourth Industrial Revolution,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.776
now, you guys know
so much better than I do,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.656
but here's the thing that concerns me.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.216
What we hear about is job loss.
You've all heard that.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.856
Our own data suggest to us
that two thirds of all jobs,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.119
currently existing jobs
in developing countries,

00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:19.856
will be lost because of automation.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.016
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.216
Now, one of the ways
to make up for those jobs

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.896
is to turn community health workers
into a formal labor force.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.176
That's what we want to do.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.456
(Applause)

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.816
We think the numbers will work out,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.616
that as health outcomes get better
and as people have formal work,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.376
we're going to be able to train them

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.656
with the soft-skills training
that you add to it

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.216
to become workers
that will have a huge impact,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.616
and that may be the one area
that grows the most.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.216
But here's the other thing
that bothers me:

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.136
right now it seems pretty clear to me
that the jobs of the future

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.016
will be more digitally demanding,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.976
and there is a crisis
in childhood stunting.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.576
So these are photos from Charles Nelson,
who shared these with us

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.056
from Harvard Medical School.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.856
And what these photos show
on the one side, on the left side,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.296
is a three-month-old who has been stunted:

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.856
not adequate nutrition,
not adequate stimulation.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.456
And on the other side,
of course, is a normal child,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.336
and the normal child
has all of these neuronal connections.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.816
Now, the neuronal connections
are important,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.056
because that is
the definition of human capital.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.776
Now, we know that we
can reduce these rates.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.176
We can reduce these rates
of childhood stunting quickly,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.656
but if we don't, India, for example,
with 38 percent childhood stunting,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.416
how are they going to compete
in the economy of the future

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.296
if 40 percent of their future workers
cannot achieve educationally

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.056
and certainly we worry
about achieving economically

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.320
in a way that will help
the country as a whole grow.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.496
Now, what are we going to do?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.376
78 trillion dollars
is the size of the global economy.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.296
8.55 trillion dollars are sitting
in negative interest rate bonds.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.776
That means that you give
the German central bank your money

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.296
and then you pay them to keep your money.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.136
That's a negative interest rate bond.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.336
24.4 trillion dollars
in very low-earning government bonds.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.576
And 8 trillion literally sitting
in the hands of rich people

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.560
under their very large mattresses.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.976
What we are trying to do
is now use our own tools --

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.696
and just to get nerdy for a second,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.216
we're talking about
first-loss risk debt instruments,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.816
we're talking about derisking,
blended finance,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.336
we're talking about
political risk insurance,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.576
credit enhancement --

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.536
all these things that I've now learned
at the World Bank Group

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.696
that rich people use every single day
to make themselves richer,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.456
but we haven't used aggressively enough
on behalf of the poor

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.096
to bring this capital in.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.960
(Applause)

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.416
So does this work?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.256
Can you actually bring
private-sector players into a country

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.656
and really make things work?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.536
Well, we've done it a couple of times.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.776
This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.976
It's a box-set solution
from the World Bank

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.416
where we come in
and we do all the things you need

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.296
to attract private-sector investors.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.896
And in this case, Zambia went
from having a cost of electricity

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.880
at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.176
and by just doing simple things,
doing the auction,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.696
changing some policies,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.696
we were able to bring the cost down.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.936
Lowest bid,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.416
25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.616
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents
a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.776
(Applause)

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.736
But here's my proposal for you.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.656
This is from a group called Zipline,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.536
a cool company, and they
literally are rocket scientists.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.976
They figured out
how to use drones in Rwanda.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.216
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.176
that delivers blood
anywhere in the country

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.736
in less than an hour.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.216
So we save lives,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.096
this program saved lives --

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.136
(Applause)

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.896
This program made money for Zipline

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.935
and this program saved
huge amounts of money for Rwanda.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.656
That's what we need,
and we need that from all of you.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.935
I'm asking you, carve out
a little bit of time in your brains

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.536
to think about the technology
that you work on,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.175
the companies that you start,
the design that you do.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.136
Think a little bit and work with us

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.456
to see if we can come up with these kinds
of extraordinary win-win solutions.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.840
I'm going to leave you
with one final story.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.176
I was in Tanzania,
and I was in a classroom.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.240
This is me with a classroom
of 11-year-olds.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.096
And I asked them, as I always do,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.176
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.936
Two raised their hands and said,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.976
"I want to be President
of the World Bank."

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.816
(Laughter)

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.256
And just like you, my own team
and their teachers laughed.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.816
But then I stopped them.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.880
I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.520
When I was born in South Korea,
this is what it looked like.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.520
This is where I came from.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.240
And when I was three years old,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.440
in preschool,

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.696
I don't think that George David Woods,
the President of the World Bank,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.296
if he had visited Korea on that day
and come to my classroom,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.656
that he would have thought

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.696
that the future President
of the World Bank

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.176
was sitting in that classroom.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.496
Don't let anyone ever tell you

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.296
that you cannot be
President of the World Bank."

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.536
Now -- thank you.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.136
(Applause)

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.800
Let me leave you with one thought.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.896
I came from a country
that was the poorest in the world.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.496
I'm President of the World Bank.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.696
I cannot and I will not
pull up the ladder behind me.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.256
This is urgent.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.776
Aspirations are going up.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.096
Everywhere aspirations are going up.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.736
You folks in this room, work with us.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.776
We know that we can find
those Zipline-type solutions

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.096
and help the poor
leapfrog into a better world,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.720
but it won't happen
until we work together.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.976
The future "you" --
and especially for your children --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.576
the future you

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.576
will depend on how much care
and compassion we bring

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.216
to ensuring that the future "us"
provides equality of opportunity

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.656
for every child in the world.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.936
Thank you very much.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.656
(Applause)

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.736
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.840
(Applause)

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.696
Chris Anderson: You'd almost think

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.856
people are surprised
to hear a talk like this

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.696
from the President of the World Bank.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.936
It's kind of cool.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.216
I'd encourage you to even be
a little more specific on your proposal.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.736
There's many investors,
entrepreneurs in this room.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.256
How will you partner with them?
What's your proposal?

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.536
Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy
for just a second.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.136
CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.
JYK: So here's what we did.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.456
Insurance companies never invest
in developing country infrastructure,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.656
for example, because
they can't take the risk.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.296
They're holding money
for people who pay for insurance.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.456
So what we did was a Swedish
International Development Association

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.936
gave us a little bit of money,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.096
we went out and raised a little bit
more money, a hundred million,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.736
and we took first loss,
meaning if this thing goes bad,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.616
10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.416
and the rest of you will be safe.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.176
And that created
a 90-percent chunk, tranche

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.656
that was triple B, investment-grade,
so the insurance companies invested.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.296
So for us, what we're doing
is taking our public money

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.856
and using it to derisk
specific instruments

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.616
to bring people in from the outside.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.576
So all of you who are sitting
on trillions of dollars of cash,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.816
come to us. Right?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.856
(Laughter)

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.136
CA: And what you're specifically
looking for are investment proposals

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.376
that create employment
in the developing world.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.776
JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.536
So these will be, for example,
in infrastructure that brings energy,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.016
builds roads, bridges, ports.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.776
These kinds of things
are necessary to create jobs,

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.096
but also what we're saying is

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.536
you may think that the technology
you're working on

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.416
or the business that you're working on

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.496
may not have applications
in the developing world,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.856
but look at Zipline.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.896
And that Zipline thing didn't happen

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.096
just because of the quality
of the technology.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.296
It was because they engaged
with the Rwandans early

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.176
and used artificial intelligence --

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.056
one thing, Rwanda has great broadband --

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.936
but these things fly
completely on their own.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.816
So we will help you do that.
We will make the introductions.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.536
We will even provide financing.
We will help you do that.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.216
CA: How much capital
is the World Bank willing to deploy

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.776
to back those kinds of efforts?

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.096
JYK: Chris, you're always getting me
to try to do something like this.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.696
CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.
JYK: So here's what we're going to do.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.456
We have 25 billion a year
that we're investing in poor countries,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.696
the poorest countries.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.776
And as we invest
over the next three years,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.216
25 billion a year,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.096
we have got to think with you

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.256
about how to use that money
more effectively.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.096
So I can't give you a specific number.
It depends on the quality of the ideas.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.656
So bring us your ideas,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.840
and I don't think that financing
is going to be the problem.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.736
CA: All right, you heard it
from the man himself.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.976
Jim, thanks so much.
JYK: Thank you. Thank you.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.400
(Applause)
