00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.611
I visit the future for a living.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.891
Not just one future,

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.161
but many possible futures,

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:12.304
bringing back evidences from those futures
for you to experience today.

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:15.420
Like an archaeologist of the future.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:19.164
Over the years, my many journeys
have brought back things

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:22.213
like a new species
of synthetically engineered bees;

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.435
a book named, "Pets as Protein;"

00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:31.427
a machine that makes you rich
by trading your genetic data;

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.498
a lamp powered by sugar;

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.926
a computer for growing food.

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:40.964
OK, so I don't actually travel
to different futures -- yet.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:43.927
But my husband Jon and I spend
a lot of time thinking

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:47.641
and creating visions
of different futures in our studio.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.857
We are constantly looking out
for weak signals,

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.255
those murmurs of future potential.

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:57.352
Then we trace those threads of potential
out into the future, asking:

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.498
What might it feel like
to live in this future?

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.903
What might we see, hear and even breathe?

00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:09.606
Then we run experiments,
build prototypes, make objects,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660
bringing aspects of these futures to life,

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:13.996
making them concrete and tangible

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.774
so you can really feel the impact
of those future possibilities

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:19.965
here and now.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:23.737
But this work is not about predictions.

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.768
It's about creating tools --

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:29.256
tools that can help connect
our present and our future selves

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.685
so we become active participants
in creating a future we want --

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.565
a future that works for all.

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.573
So how do we go about doing this?

00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:42.487
For a recent project called Drone Aviary,

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.049
we were interested in exploring

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:47.040
what it would mean to live
with drones in our cities.

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:49.897
Drones that have the power
to see things we can't,

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.673
to go places we can't

00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:53.896
and to do so with increasing autonomy.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.324
But to understand the technology,

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.217
getting our hands dirty was crucial.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.482
So we built several different
drones in our studio.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:04.610
We gave them names, functions
and then flew them --

00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:06.908
but not without difficulty.

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.802
Things came loose,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.446
GPS signals glitched

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.882
and drones crashed.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.741
But it was through such experimentation

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:18.940
that we could construct a very
concrete and very experiential slice

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:20.587
of one possible future.

00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:23.688
So now, let's go to that future.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.569
Let's imagine we are living in a city
with drones like this one.

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:30.123
We call it The Nightwatchman.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:34.645
It patrols the streets, often spotted
in the evenings and at night.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.639
Initially, many of us were annoyed
by its low, dull hum.

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:41.912
But then, like everything else,
we got used to it.

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:45.157
Now, what if you could see
the world through its eyes?

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:50.937
See how it constantly logs
every resident of our neighborhood;

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:54.281
logging the kids who play football
in the no-ballgame area

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:56.752
and marking them as statutory nuisances.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.213
(Laughter)

00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:02.207
And then see how it disperses
this other group, who are teenagers,

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.345
with the threat of an autonomously
issued injunction.

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:09.520
And then there's this giant
floating disc called Madison.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:12.423
Its glaring presence is so overpowering,

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:14.600
I can't help but stare at it.

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:17.243
But if feels like each time I look at it,

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.081
it knows a little more about me --

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:23.079
like it keeps flashing all these
Brianair adverts at me,

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.447
as if it knows about
the holiday I'm planning.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.206
I'm not sure if I find this
mildly entertaining

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.042
or just entirely invasive.

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:35.008
Back to the present.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.834
In creating this future, we learned a lot.

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:40.958
Not just about how these machines work,

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.841
but what it would feel like
to live alongside them.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.493
Whilst drones like Madison
and Nightwatchman,

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.034
in these particular forms,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.599
are not real yet,

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:53.580
most elements of a drone future
are in fact very real today.

00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:55.415
For instance,

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.753
facial recognition systems
are everywhere --

00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.187
in our phones, even in our thermostats

00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:02.041
and in cameras around our cities --

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:05.460
keeping a record of everything we do,

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:09.669
whether it's an advertisement
we glanced at or a protest we attended.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.363
These things are here,

00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:14.111
and we often don't understand
how they work,

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:15.985
and what their consequences could be.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.859
And we see this all around us.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.655
This difficulty in even imagining

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:24.823
how the consequences of our actions
today will affect our future.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:28.534
Last year, where I live, in the UK,
there was a referendum

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:31.083
where the people could vote
for the UK to leave the EU

00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:32.265
or stay in the EU,

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.991
popularly known as "Brexit."

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.621
And soon after the results came out,

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:39.660
a word began to surface
called "Bregret" --

00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:40.724
(Laughter)

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:44.183
describing people who chose to vote
for Brexit as a protest,

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:47.297
but without thinking through
its potential consequences.

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:52.551
And this disconnect is evident
in some of the simplest things.

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:55.664
Say you go out for a quick drink.

00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:58.422
Then you decide
you wouldn't mind a few more.

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:01.066
You know you'll wake up
in the morning feeling awful,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.472
but you justify it by saying,

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.999
"The other me in the future
will deal with that."

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.475
But as we find out in the morning,

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.464
that future "you" is you.

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:13.651
When I was growing up in India
in the late '70s and early '80s,

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:14.826
there was a feeling

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.837
that the future both needed to
and could actually be planned.

00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:21.603
I remember my parents had to plan
for some of the simplest things.

00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:23.656
When they wanted a telephone in our house,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.990
they needed to order it and then wait --

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:29.261
wait for nearly five years before
it got installed in our house.

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:30.319
(Laughter)

00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:33.841
And then if they wanted to call
my grandparents who lived in another city,

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.393
they needed to book
something called a "trunk call,"

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.677
and then wait again,
for hours or even days.

00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.235
And then abruptly, the phone
would ring at two in the morning,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.509
and all of us would jump out of our beds
and gather round the phone,

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.848
shrieking into it,
discussing general well-being

00:05:47.872 --> 00:05:49.205
at two in the morning.

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.009
Today it can feel like things
are happening too fast --

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.288
so fast, that it can
become really difficult

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.269
for us to form an understanding
of our place in history.

00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:01.720
It creates an overwhelming sense
of uncertainty and anxiety,

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.786
and so, we let the future
just happen to us.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.027
We don't connect with that future "us."

00:06:08.528 --> 00:06:10.840
We treat our future selves as a stranger,

00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:12.832
and the future as a foreign land.

00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:14.920
It's not a foreign land;

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:16.692
it's unfolding right in front of us,

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:19.280
continually being shaped
by our actions today.

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:21.224
We are that future,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.770
and so I believe fighting
for a future we want

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:27.417
is more urgent and necessary
than ever before.

00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:29.762
We have learned in our work

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:33.230
that one of the most powerful means
of effecting change

00:06:33.254 --> 00:06:37.398
is when people can directly, tangibly
and emotionally experience

00:06:37.422 --> 00:06:40.450
some of the future consequences
of their actions today.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.104
Earlier this year, the government
of the United Arab Emirates invited us

00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:47.574
to help them shape
their country's energy strategy

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.182
all the way up to 2050.

00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:53.816
Based on the government's econometric
data, we created this large city model,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.908
and visualized many
possible futures on it.

00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:01.707
As I was excitably taking a group
of government officials

00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.268
and members of energy companies

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:05.823
through one sustainable
future on our model,

00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:07.577
one of the participants told me,

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:11.229
"I cannot imagine that in the future
people will stop driving cars

00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:13.051
and start using public transport."

00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:15.076
And then he said,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.706
"There's no way I can tell my own son
to stop driving his car."

00:07:19.927 --> 00:07:21.908
But we were prepared for this reaction.

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.545
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab
in my home city in India,

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.744
we had created approximate samples

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:33.518
of what the air would be like in 2030
if our behavior stays the same.

00:07:34.493 --> 00:07:37.886
And so, I walked the group
over to this object

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.257
that emits vapor from those air samples.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:45.050
Just one whiff of the noxious
polluted air from 2030

00:07:45.074 --> 00:07:48.191
brought home the point
that no amount of data can.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.121
This is not the future you would want
your children to inherit.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.185
The next day, the government
made a big announcement.

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:58.372
They would be investing billions
of dollars in renewables.

00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:02.775
We don't know what part our future
experiences played in this decision,

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:05.291
but we know that they've changed
their energy policy

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:06.799
to mitigate such a scenario.

00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:10.328
While something like air from the future
is very effective and tangible,

00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:13.182
the trajectory from our present
to a future consequence

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:14.511
is not always so linear.

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:18.520
Even when a technology
is developed with utopian ideals,

00:08:18.544 --> 00:08:21.277
the moment it leaves the laboratory
and enters the world,

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.646
it is subject to forces outside
of the creators' control.

00:08:25.617 --> 00:08:29.851
For one particular project,
we investigated medical genomics:

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.966
the technology of gathering
and using people's genetic data

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.849
to create personalized medicine.

00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:36.646
We were asking:

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.394
What are some of the unintended
consequences of linking our genetics

00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:41.579
to health care?

00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:45.441
To explore this question further,

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:47.357
we created a fictional lawsuit,

00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:52.300
and brought it to life through 31 pieces
of carefully crafted evidence.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:55.871
So we built an illegal genetic clinic,

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:59.078
a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,

00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:01.438
and even bought frozen mice on eBay.

00:09:02.273 --> 00:09:05.428
So now let's go to that future
where this lawsuit is unfolding,

00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:07.574
and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:11.759
Arnold is being prosecuted
by this global giant biotech company

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:13.081
called Dynamic Genetics,

00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:15.117
because they have evidence

00:09:15.141 --> 00:09:19.731
that Arnold has illegally inserted
the company's patented genetic material

00:09:19.755 --> 00:09:21.249
into his body.

00:09:21.273 --> 00:09:23.863
How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?

00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:26.027
Well, it all started

00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:30.234
when Arnold was asked to submit
a saliva sample in this spit kit

00:09:30.258 --> 00:09:31.816
to the NHI --

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.790
the UK's National Health
Insurance service.

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:38.209
When Arnold received
his health insurance bill,

00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:39.945
he was shocked and scared

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.351
to see that his premiums
had gone through the roof,

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:45.349
beyond anything he or his family
could ever afford.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.651
The state's algorithm had scanned
his genetic data

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:52.683
and found the risk of a chronic health
condition lurking in his DNA.

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:56.499
And so Arnold had to start paying
toward the potential costs

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.199
of that future disease --

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.406
potential future disease from today.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.042
In that moment of fear and panic,

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.572
Arnold slipped through the city

00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:06.654
into the dark shadows
of this illegal clinic for treatment --

00:10:07.457 --> 00:10:09.618
a treatment that would modify his DNA

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:13.300
so that the state's algorithm
would no longer see him as a risk,

00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:16.301
and his insurance premiums
would become affordable again.

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:18.010
But Arnold was caught.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:22.112
And the legal proceedings in the case
Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:24.653
In bringing such a future to life,

00:10:24.677 --> 00:10:27.631
what was important to us
was that people could actually touch,

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:29.223
see and feel its potential,

00:10:29.757 --> 00:10:32.752
because such an immediate and close
encounter provokes people

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.267
to ask the right questions,

00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:36.087
questions like:

00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:38.297
What are the implications
of living in a world

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:40.310
where I'm judged on my genetics?

00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:44.186
Or: Who might claim ownership
to my genetic data,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.720
and what might they do with it?

00:10:46.918 --> 00:10:50.027
If this feels even slightly
out-there or farfetched,

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:53.843
today there's a little-known bill
being passed through the American congress

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:57.916
known as HR 1313, Preserving
Employee Wellness Programs Act.

00:10:58.455 --> 00:11:02.935
This bill proposes to amend the Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act,

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.665
popularly known as GINA,

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:07.997
and would allow employers to ask
about family medical history

00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:09.205
and genetic data

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:11.798
to all employees for the first time.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.532
Those who refuse
would face large penalties.

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:19.100
In the work I've shown so far,

00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:21.287
whether it was drones or genetic crimes,

00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:23.669
these stories describe troubling futures

00:11:23.693 --> 00:11:26.445
with the intention of helping us
avoid those futures.

00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:28.981
But what about what we can't avoid?

00:11:29.577 --> 00:11:31.669
Today, especially with climate change,

00:11:31.693 --> 00:11:33.763
it looks like we are heading for trouble.

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:37.350
And so what we want to do now
is to prepare for that future

00:11:37.374 --> 00:11:41.631
by developing tools and attitudes
that can help us find hope --

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:44.094
hope that can inspire action.

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:47.596
Currently, we are running
an experiment in our studio.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.097
It's a work in progress.

00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:51.763
Based on climate data projections,

00:11:51.787 --> 00:11:53.343
we are exploring a future

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:56.800
where the Western world has moved
from abundance to scarcity.

00:11:56.824 --> 00:12:00.235
We imagine living in a future city
with repeated flooding,

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:02.996
periods with almost
no food in supermarkets,

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.756
economic instabilities,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.465
broken supply chains.

00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:11.167
What can we do to not just survive,
but prosper in such a world?

00:12:12.015 --> 00:12:13.361
What food can we eat?

00:12:14.163 --> 00:12:15.982
To really step inside these questions,

00:12:16.006 --> 00:12:19.820
we are building this room in a flat
in London from 2050.

00:12:20.654 --> 00:12:23.970
It's like a little time capsule
that we reclaimed from the future.

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:26.140
We stripped it down to the bare minimum.

00:12:26.164 --> 00:12:28.070
Everything we lovingly put in our homes,

00:12:28.094 --> 00:12:29.770
like flat-panel TVs,

00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:31.590
internet-connected fridges

00:12:31.614 --> 00:12:33.043
and artisanal furnishings

00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:34.389
all had to go.

00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:37.315
And in its place,
we're building food computers

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.193
from abandoned, salvaged
and repurposed materials,

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:43.122
turning today's waste
into tomorrow's dinner.

00:12:44.707 --> 00:12:45.858
For instance,

00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:49.870
we've just finished building our first
fully automated fogponics machine.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.310
It uses the technique of fogponics --
so just fog as a nutrient,

00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:54.913
not even water or soil --

00:12:54.937 --> 00:12:56.332
to grow things quickly.

00:12:57.324 --> 00:12:58.543
At the moment,

00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:00.291
we have successfully grown tomatoes.

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:04.381
But we'll need more food than what
we can grow in this small room.

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:06.940
So what else could we forage
from the city?

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:10.881
Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.363
Earlier, we brought back
air from the future.

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:19.110
This time we are bringing
an entire room from the future,

00:13:19.134 --> 00:13:21.481
a room full of hope, tools and tactics

00:13:21.505 --> 00:13:24.640
to create positive action
in hostile conditions.

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:26.975
Spending time in this room,

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:29.062
a room that could be our own future home,

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:32.648
makes the consequences
of climate change and food insecurity

00:13:32.672 --> 00:13:34.911
much more immediate and tangible.

00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:40.083
What we're learning through such
experiments and our practice

00:13:40.107 --> 00:13:41.598
and the people we engage with

00:13:41.622 --> 00:13:43.873
is that creating concrete experiences

00:13:43.897 --> 00:13:47.210
can bridge the disconnect
between today and tomorrow.

00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.655
By putting ourselves
into different possible futures,

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.241
by becoming open and willing

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:56.605
to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort
that such an act can bring,

00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:59.714
we have the opportunity
to imagine new possibilities.

00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:02.127
We can find optimistic futures;

00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:03.992
we can find paths forward;

00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:06.068
we can move beyond hope into action.

00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:10.061
It means we have the chance
to change direction,

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.119
a chance to have our voices heard,

00:14:13.832 --> 00:14:18.047
a chance to write ourselves
into a future we want.

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:21.586
Other worlds are possible.

00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:23.636
Thank you.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.849
(Applause)
