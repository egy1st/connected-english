00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:04.456
My name is Katrina Spade,
and I grew up in a medical family

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.320
where it was fairly normal to talk
about death and dying at the dinner table.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.656
But I didn't go into medicine
like so many of my family members.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.760
Instead, I went to architecture school
to learn how to design.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.296
And while I was there,
I began to be curious

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.880
about what would happen
to my physical body after I died.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.720
What would my nearest
and dearest do with me?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.696
So if the existence
and the fact of your own mortality

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.416
doesn't get you down,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.880
the state of our current
funerary practices will.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680
Today, almost 50 percent of Americans
choose conventional burial.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.816
Conventional burial begins with embalming,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.616
where funeral staff drain bodily fluid

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.496
and replace it with a mixture
designed to preserve the corpse

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.560
and give it a lifelike glow.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.976
Then, as you know,
bodies are buried in a casket

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.176
in a concrete-lined grave

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.400
in a cemetery.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.776
All told, in US cemeteries,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.560
we bury enough metal
to build a Golden Gate Bridge,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.016
enough wood to build
1,800 single family homes,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.816
and enough formaldehyde-laden
embalming fluid

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.880
to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
In addition, cemeteries
all over the world are reaching capacity.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.536
Turns out, it doesn't really
make good business sense

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.096
to sell someone
a piece of land for eternity.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.136
(Laughter)

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.776
Whose idea was that?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480
In some places, you can't buy a plot
no matter how much money you have.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.760
As a result, cremation rates
have risen fast.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.336
In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother
be incinerated after she died,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.760
you'd probably be kicked
from the family deathbed.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.176
But today, almost half
of Americans choose cremation,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.520
citing simpler,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.096
cheaper

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.080
and more ecological as reasons.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.496
I used to think that cremation
was a sustainable form of disposition,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.320
but just think about it for a second.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.856
Cremation destroys the potential we have

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.320
to give back to the earth
after we've died.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.616
It uses an energy-intensive process
to turn bodies into ash,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.800
polluting the air
and contributing to climate change.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.096
All told, cremations in the US

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.416
emit a staggering 600 million
pounds of carbon dioxide

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.120
into the atmosphere annually.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.416
The truly awful truth

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.320
is that the very last thing
that most of us will do on this earth

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.240
is poison it.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.816
It's like we've created, accepted
and death-denied our way into a status quo

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.456
that puts as much distance
between ourselves and nature

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.120
as is humanly possible.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.456
Our modern funerary practices
are designed to stave off

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.160
the natural processes
that happen to a body after death.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
In other words, they're meant
to prevent us from decomposing.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.136
But the truth

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760
is that nature is really,
really good at death.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.816
We've all seen it.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.576
When organic material dies in nature,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.336
microbes and bacteria
break it down into nutrient-rich soil,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.920
completing the life cycle.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.160
In nature, death creates life.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.480
Back in architecture school,
I was thinking about all this,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.240
and I set out on a plan
to redesign death care.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.056
Could I create a system

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.936
that was beneficial to the earth

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.520
and that used nature as a guide
rather than something to be feared?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.800
Something that was gentle to the planet?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.096
That planet, after all,
supports our living bodies

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.840
our whole lives.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.656
And while I was mulling this all over

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.880
over the drawing board,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.800
the phone rang.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720
It was my friend Kate.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.256
She was like, "Hey,
have you heard about the farmers

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560
who are composting whole cows?"

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.495
And I was like, "Mmmm."

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.279
(Laughter)

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.576
Turns out that farmers
in agricultural institutions

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.016
have been practicing something
called livestock mortality composting

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.576
for decades.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.576
Mortality composting is where
you take an animal high in nitrogen

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.760
and cover it with co-composting materials
that are high in carbon.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.416
It's an aerobic process,
so it requires oxygen,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.760
and it requires
plenty of moisture as well.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.176
In the most basic setup, a cow
is covered with a few feet of wood chips,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.536
which are high in carbon,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.856
and left outside for nature,
for breezes to provide oxygen

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640
and rain to provide moisture.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.016
In about nine months,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.080
all that remains
is a nutrient-rich compost.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.376
The flesh has been decomposed entirely,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.960
as have the bones.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.736
I know.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.256
(Laughter)

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.456
So I would definitely
call myself a decomposition nerd,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.560
but I am far, far from a scientist,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.056
and one way you can tell this is true

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.376
is that I have often called
the process of composting "magic."

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.256
(Laughter)

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.720
So basically, all we humans need to do

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.440
is create the right environment
for nature to do its job.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.536
It's like the opposite
of antibacterial soap.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.816
Instead of fighting them,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.160
we welcome microbes and bacteria
in with open arms.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.576
These tiny, amazing creatures

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.616
break down molecules
into smaller molecules and atoms,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.960
which are then incorporated
into new molecules.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.520
In other words, that cow is transformed.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.720
It's no longer a cow.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.400
It's been cycled back into nature.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.760
See? Magic.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.496
You can probably imagine
the light bulb that went off in my head

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.092
after I received that phone call.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.416
I began designing a system

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.520
based on the principles
of livestock mortality composting

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.720
that would take human beings
and transform them into soil.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.736
Fast-forward five years

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.976
and the project has grown in ways
I truly never could have imagined.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.456
We've created a scalable,
replicable non-profit urban model

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.976
based on the science
of livestock mortality composting

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480
that turns human beings into soil.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.936
We've partnered and collaborated
with experts in soil science,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.496
decomposition, alternative death care,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.920
law and architecture.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.061
We've raised funds
from foundations and individuals

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.616
in order to design
a prototype of this system,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.416
and we've heard from tens of thousands
of people all over the world

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.680
who want this option to be available.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.296
OK.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.136
In the next few years,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.056
it's our goal to build the first
full-scale human composting facility

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.856
right in the city of Seattle.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.720
(Applause)

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.080
Imagine it,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.816
part public park,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.576
part funeral home,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.296
part memorial to the people we love,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.416
a place where we can reconnect
with the cycles of nature

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.240
and treat bodies
with gentleness and respect.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.576
The infrastructure is simple.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.216
Inside a vertical core,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.336
bodies and wood chips undergo
accelerated natural decomposition,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.656
or composting,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.400
and are transformed into soil.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.600
When someone dies, their body
is taken to a human composting facility.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.256
After wrapping the deceased
in a simple shroud,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.320
friends and family carry the body
to the top of the core,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.040
which contains the natural
decomposition system.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.536
During a laying in ceremony,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.936
they gently place the body into the core

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.341
and cover it with wood chips.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.320
This begins the gentle transformation
from human to soil.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.360
Over the next few weeks,
the body decomposes naturally.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.736
Microbes and bacteria
break down carbon, then protein,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.856
to create a new substance,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.280
a rich, earthy soil.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.160
This soil can then be used
to grow new life.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.480
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.

00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:50.736
(Applause)

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.976
Yeah, thank you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.360
(Applause)

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.416
Who's thinking about
lemon meringue pie right now?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.576
(Laughter)

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.800
A lemon drop?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.920
Something stronger?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.536
So in addition to housing the core,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.256
these buildings will function
to support the grieving

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.880
by providing space for memorial services
and end-of-life planning.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.096
The potential for repurposing is huge.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.736
Old churches and industrial warehouses
can be converted into places

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400
where we create soil and honor life.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.976
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.776
that's been diluted
over the past hundred years

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.896
as cremation rates have risen

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.560
and religious affiliation has declined.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.976
Our Seattle facility will function
as a model for these places

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.600
all over the world.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.256
We've heard from communities
in South Africa, Australia,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.200
the UK, Canada and beyond.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.336
We're creating a design toolkit

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.560
that will help others
design and build facilities

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.816
that will contain technical specifications

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.560
and regulatory best practices.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.576
We want to help individuals,
organizations,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.816
and down the road, municipalities

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.800
design and build facilities
in their own cities.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.016
The idea is that every one of these places
should look and feel completely different

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.936
with the same system inside.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.016
They're really meant to be designed
for the neighborhood in which they reside

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.960
and the community which they serve.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.696
The other idea is
for supportive staff to be on hand

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.280
to help families with the care
and preparation of loved ones' bodies.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.936
We're banishing practices
that bewilder and disempower

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.440
and creating a system
that is beautiful and meaningful

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.640
and transparent.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.736
We believe that access
to ecological death care

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.960
is a human right.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.736
OK, so you know the old saying,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.336
if you can compost a cow,
you can compost a human?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.360
(Laughter)

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.760
Turns out, it's true.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.376
Since 2014, we've been
running a pilot project

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.256
in the hills of North Carolina

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.200
with the Forensic Anthropology Department
at Western Carolina University.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.576
Six donor bodies
have been covered in wood chips,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.896
oxygen provided by breezes,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.200
microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.936
This pilot program has allowed us
to demonstrate that it's possible

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.656
to harness the incredible power
of natural decomposition

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.600
to turn human bodies into soil,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.800
and we're working
with other universities as well.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.360
Soil scientists
at Washington State University,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.056
the grad students, anyway,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.136
are working to compost
teeth with amalgam fillings

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.080
so that we can understand
what happens to the mercury therein.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.096
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.576
to determine what happens
to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.336
during the composting process,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.720
and whether additional
remediation will be needed.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.376
By the way,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.896
composting creates a great deal of heat,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.280
especially this particular
type of composting.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.656
One week after we began
composting our fifth donor body,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.816
the temperature inside
that mound of wood chips

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.920
reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.136
Imagine harnessing that heat
to create energy

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.600
or comfort the grieving on a cold day.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.880
The death care revolution has begun.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.680
It's an exciting time to be alive.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.856
Thank you.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.360
(Applause)
