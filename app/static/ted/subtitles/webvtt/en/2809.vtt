00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:02.842
I remember when I first found out

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.905
I was going to speak at a TED conference.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.040
I ran across the hall
to one of my classrooms

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.493
to inform my students.

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:09.765
"Guess what, guys?

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.867
I've been asked to give a TED Talk."

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:13.922
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.404
The whole room went silent.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:20.094
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one
you made us watch on grit?

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.813
Or the one with the scientist that did
this really awesome thing with robots?"

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.003
Muhammad asked.

00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:26.448
"Yes, just like that."

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:30.071
"But Coach, those people
are really important and smart."

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:32.172
(Laughter)

00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:33.518
"I know that."

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:38.510
"But Coach, why are you speaking?
You hate public speaking."

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:40.580
"I do," I admitted,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.933
"But it's important that I speak about us,
that I speak about your journeys,

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.116
about my journey.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.409
People need to know."

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:51.811
The students at the all-refugee
school that I founded

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.227
decided to end with some
words of encouragement.

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:56.070
"Cool! It better be good, Coach."

00:00:56.094 --> 00:00:58.794
(Laughter)

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:02.376
There are 65.3 million people
who have been forcibly displaced

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.948
from their homes because
of war or persecution.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.018
The largest number,
11 million, are from Syria.

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:14.322
33,952 people flee their homes daily.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:20.044
The vast majority remain in refugee camps,

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:24.093
whose conditions cannot be defined
as humane under anyone's definition.

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:29.036
We are participating
in the degradation of humans.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.531
Never have we had numbers this high.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.676
This is the highest number
of refugees since World War II.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.187
Now, let me tell you why this issue
is so important to me.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.894
I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:47.291
I am a Muslim.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.780
I've also spent the last 12 years
of my life working with refugees.

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.246
Oh -- and I'm also gay.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.170
It makes me really popular these days.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.085
(Laughter)

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.053
But I am the daughter of a refugee.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:04.554
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964
during the first Assad regime.

00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:08.025
She was three months pregnant
when she packed up a suitcase,

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.143
piled in her five children
and drove to neighboring Jordan,

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.179
not knowing what the future held
for her and her family.

00:02:14.203 --> 00:02:17.840
My grandfather decided to stay,
not believing it was that bad.

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:22.036
He followed her a month later,
after his brothers were tortured

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.489
and his factory was taken over
by the government.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.233
They rebuilt their lives
starting from scratch

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.532
and eventually became independently
wealthy Jordanian citizens.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.462
I was born in Jordan 11 years later.

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.741
It was really important to my grandmother
for us to know our history

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:39.919
and our journey.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:44.500
I was eight years old when she took me
to visit my first refugee camp.

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:45.964
I didn't understand why.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:48.767
I didn't know why
it was so important to her

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.241
for us to go.

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:53.204
I remember walking into the camp
holding her hand,

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:55.197
and her saying, "Go play with the kids,"

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.724
while she visited
with the women in the camp.

00:02:58.606 --> 00:02:59.818
I didn't want to.

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.258
These kids weren't like me.

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.060
They were poor. They lived in a camp.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.424
I refused.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:07.414
She knelt down beside me
and firmly said, "Go.

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:09.592
And don't come back until you've played.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:11.656
Don't ever think people are beneath you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.979
or that you have nothing
to learn from others."

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.969
I reluctantly went.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:18.281
I never wanted to disappoint
my grandmother.

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:20.872
I returned a few hours later,

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:25.526
having spent some time playing soccer
with the kids in the camp.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.316
We walked out of the camp,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.035
and I was excitedly telling her
what a great time I had

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.990
and how fantastic the kids were.

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.855
"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them."

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:39.735
"Haram on us," she said,
using the word's different meaning,

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.092
that we were sinning.

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:44.375
"Don't feel sorry for them;
believe in them."

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.770
It wasn't until I left my country
of origin for the United States

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.806
that I realized the impact of her words.

00:03:53.187 --> 00:03:56.861
After my college graduation, I applied for
and was granted political asylum,

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:58.977
based on being a member of a social group.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.400
Some people may not realize this,

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.090
but you can still get the death penalty
in some countries for being gay.

00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:09.121
I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.594
That was the hardest decision
I've ever had to make,

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:12.998
but I had no other choice.

00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:18.630
The point is,

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:22.582
when you find yourself choosing
between home and survival,

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:25.438
the question "Where are you from?"
becomes very loaded.

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:30.039
A Syrian woman who I recently met
at a refugee camp in Greece

00:04:30.063 --> 00:04:31.331
articulated it best,

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:34.925
when she recalled the exact moment
she realized she had to flee Aleppo.

00:04:35.277 --> 00:04:37.535
"I looked out the window
and there was nothing.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:38.918
It was all rubble.

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:43.385
There were no stores, no streets,
no schools. Everything was gone.

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.053
I had been in my apartment for months,

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:49.147
listening to bombs drop
and watching people die.

00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:51.834
But I always thought it would get better,

00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:55.102
that no one could force me to leave,

00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:57.168
no one could take my home away from me.

00:04:57.795 --> 00:05:01.067
And I don't know why it was that morning,
but when I looked outside,

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.229
I realized if I didn't leave,
my three young children would die.

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:05.642
And so we left.

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:08.670
We left because we had to,
not because we wanted to.

00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:10.442
There was no choice," she said.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.256
It's kind of hard to believe
that you belong

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.744
when you don't have a home,

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:19.774
when your country of origin rejects you
because of fear or persecution,

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:23.702
or the city that you grew up in
is completely destroyed.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:26.836
I didn't feel like I had a home.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.317
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,

00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:30.973
but I wasn't American, either.

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:33.381
I felt a kind of loneliness

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:35.524
that is still hard
to put into words today.

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:40.064
After college, I desperately needed
to find a place to call home.

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:42.262
I bounced around from state to state

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:44.721
and eventually ended up in North Carolina.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.870
Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.747
offered to pay rent

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:52.719
or buy me a meal or a suit
for my new interview.

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:55.766
It just made me feel
more isolated and incapable.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.295
It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.055
a Southern Baptist who took me in
at my lowest and gave me a job,

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.972
that I started to believe in myself.

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:08.492
Miss Sarah owned a diner
in the mountains of North Carolina.

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.025
I assumed, because
of my privileged upbringing

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:13.568
and my Seven Sister education,

00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:15.796
that she would ask me
to manage the restaurant.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.028
I was wrong.

00:06:17.972 --> 00:06:19.675
I started off washing dishes,

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.678
cleaning toilets and working the grill.

00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:25.332
I was humbled; I was shown
the value of hard work.

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:27.966
But most importantly,
I felt valued and embraced.

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:30.804
I celebrated Christmas with her family,

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.180
and she attempted to observe
Ramadan with me.

00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:36.906
I remember being very nervous
about coming out to her --

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.972
after all, she was a Southern Baptist.

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.456
I sat on the couch next to her

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.011
and I said, "Miss Sarah,
you know that I'm gay."

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.221
Her response is one
that I will never forget.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:47.914
"That's fine, honey.
Just don't be a slut."

00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:51.110
(Laughter)

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.809
(Applause)

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:59.745
I eventually moved to Atlanta,
still trying to find my home.

00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.640
My journey took a strange turn
three years later,

00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.897
after I met a group of refugee kids
playing soccer outside.

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.858
I'd made a wrong turn
into this apartment complex,

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:11.097
and I saw these kids
outside playing soccer.

00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:14.059
They were playing barefoot
with a raggedy soccer ball

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.535
and rocks set up as goals.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:17.259
I watched them for about an hour,

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:18.861
and after that I was smiling.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:20.883
The boys reminded me of home.

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:23.846
They reminded me of the way
I grew up playing soccer

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.500
in the streets of Jordan,
with my brothers and cousins.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.793
I eventually joined their game.

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.660
They were a little skeptical
about letting me join it,

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:35.346
because according to them,
girls don't know how to play.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.716
But obviously I did.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.984
I asked them if they had
ever played on a team.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:41.442
They said they hadn't,
but that they would love to.

00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.952
I gradually won them over,
and we formed our first team.

00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:50.735
This group of kids would give me
a crash course in refugees, poverty

00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.229
and humanity.

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.930
Three brothers from Afghanistan --
Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --

00:07:57.954 --> 00:07:59.578
played a major role in that.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.948
I showed up late to practice one day
to find the field completely deserted.

00:08:03.972 --> 00:08:05.153
I was really worried.

00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:06.788
My team loved to practice.

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:09.419
It wasn't like them to miss practice.

00:08:09.443 --> 00:08:12.531
I got out of my car, and two kids
ran out from behind a dumpster,

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:14.138
waving their hands frantically.

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:17.142
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:18.744
There was blood everywhere."

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:21.223
"What do you mean?
What do you mean he got beat up?"

00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:23.320
"These bad kids came
and beat him up, Coach.

00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:25.570
Everybody left. They were all scared."

00:08:25.594 --> 00:08:28.312
We hopped into my car
and drove over to Rooh's apartment.

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:30.835
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.341
"Where's Rooh? I need
to talk to him, see if he's OK."

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:37.301
"He's in his room, Coach.
He's refusing to come out."

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:38.492
I knocked on the door.

00:08:38.516 --> 00:08:40.942
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:44.017
I need to see if you're OK
or if we need to go to the hospital."

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.192
He came out.

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:47.478
He had a big gash on his head,
a split lip,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.770
and he was physically shaken.

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:51.847
I was looking at him,

00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:54.430
and I asked the boys
to call for their mom,

00:08:54.454 --> 00:08:56.866
because I needed to go
to the hospital with him.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.197
They called for their mom.

00:08:58.608 --> 00:08:59.800
She came out.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:03.818
I had my back turned to her,
and she started screaming in Farsi.

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.652
The boys fell to the ground laughing.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:07.828
I was very confused,

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:09.926
because there was nothing
funny about this.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.390
They explained to me that she said,

00:09:12.414 --> 00:09:15.228
"You told me your coach
was a Muslim and a woman."

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:17.621
From behind, I didn't appear
to be either to her.

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:21.278
(Laughter)

00:09:21.302 --> 00:09:23.538
"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her.

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:25.493
"Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A)llāh,"

00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:27.886
reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.

00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:29.891
Confused,

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.198
and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured,

00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:34.377
she realized that yes,

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:37.692
I, this American-acting,
shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman,

00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:38.906
was indeed a Muslim.

00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:42.116
Their family had fled the Taliban.

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:45.391
Hundreds of people in their village

00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:46.661
were murdered.

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.898
Their father was taken in by the Taliban,

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.723
only to return a few months later,
a shell of the man he once was.

00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:57.149
The family escaped to Pakistan,

00:09:57.173 --> 00:10:00.741
and the two older boys,
age eight and 10 at the time,

00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:04.002
wove rugs for 10 hours a day
to provide for their family.

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:08.683
They were so excited when they found out
that they had been approved

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:11.199
to resettle in the United States,

00:10:11.223 --> 00:10:14.476
making them the lucky 0.1 percent
who get to do that.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.090
They had hit the jackpot.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.500
Their story is not unique.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:22.993
Every refugee family I have worked with
has had some version of this.

00:10:23.017 --> 00:10:24.357
I work with kids

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:29.065
who have seen their mothers raped,
their fathers' fingers sliced off.

00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:32.044
One kid saw a bullet
put in his grandmother's head,

00:10:32.068 --> 00:10:36.106
because she refused to let the rebels
take him to be a child soldier.

00:10:37.943 --> 00:10:39.484
Their journeys are haunting.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:45.714
But what I get to see every day
is hope, resilience, determination,

00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:46.923
a love of life

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:49.791
and appreciation for being able
to rebuild their lives.

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:53.732
I was at the boys' apartment one night,

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:58.566
when the mom came home
after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.883
She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.754
saying that he was going to take care
of her once he graduated.

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:06.272
She smiled from exhaustion.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:09.704
"God is good. Life is good.
We are lucky to be here."

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:15.796
In the last two years, we have seen
an escalating anti-refugee sentiment.

00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:17.438
It's global.

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:21.823
The numbers continue to grow
because we do nothing to prevent it

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.548
and nothing to stop it.

00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:27.124
The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees
from coming into our countries.

00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:30.136
The issue should be
not forcing them to leave their own.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.595
(Applause)

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.835
Sorry.

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:51.787
(Applause)

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.442
How much more suffering,

00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:02.511
how much more suffering must we take?

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:06.026
How many more people need to be
forced out of their homes

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.431
before we say, "Enough!"?

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:08.664
A hundred million?

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.951
Not only do we shame,
blame and reject them

00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:16.078
for atrocities that they had
absolutely nothing to do with,

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:18.167
we re-traumatize them,

00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:21.156
when we're supposed to be welcoming
them into our countries.

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.594
We strip them of their dignity
and treat them like criminals.

00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.324
I had a student in my office
a couple of weeks ago.

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:31.164
She's originally from Iraq.

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:32.627
She broke down crying.

00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:35.223
"Why do they hate us?"

00:12:35.247 --> 00:12:36.421
"Who hates you?"

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.216
"Everyone; everyone hates us
because we are refugees,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.596
because we are Muslim."

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:44.355
In the past, I was able
to reassure my students

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:47.016
that the majority of the world
does not hate refugees.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.425
But this time I couldn't.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:52.348
I couldn't explain to her why someone
tried to rip off her mother's hijab

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.157
when they were grocery shopping,

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:57.425
or why a player on an opposing
team called her a terrorist

00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:59.932
and told her to go back
where she came from.

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:01.718
I couldn't reassure her

00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:04.081
that her father's ultimate life sacrifice

00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:07.225
by serving in the United States
military as an interpreter

00:13:07.249 --> 00:13:09.959
would make her more valued
as an American citizen.

00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:13.923
We take in so few refugees worldwide.

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:17.635
We resettle less than 0.1 percent.

00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:21.978
That 0.1 percent benefits us
more than them.

00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:26.583
It dumbfounds me how the word "refugee"
is considered something to be dirty,

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:28.220
something to be ashamed of.

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:30.108
They have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:36.550
We have seen advances
in every aspect of our lives --

00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:37.952
except our humanity.

00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:42.962
There are 65.3 million people
who have been forced out of their homes

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:44.230
because of war --

00:13:44.685 --> 00:13:46.534
the largest number in history.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.167
We are the ones who should be ashamed.

00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:50.867
Thank you.

00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:57.420
(Applause)
