00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:03.040
I want to give you a new perspective.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.840
That sounds grandiose, and it is.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280
I left Ireland yesterday morning.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.336
I traveled from Dublin to New York

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.560
independently.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.976
But the design of an airport,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.536
plane and terminal

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.480
offers little independence when
you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.440
For Americans, that's 3' 5".

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400
I was whisked through the airport
by airline assistants in a wheelchair.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.776
but the design of an airport

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.056
and its lack of accessibility

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.160
means that it's my only way
to get through.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.016
With my carry-on bag between my feet,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.416
I was wheeled through
security, preclearance

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
and I arrived at my boarding gate.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.736
I use the accessibility
services in the airport

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
because most of the terminal
is just not designed with me in mind.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.640
Take security, for example.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.416
I'm not strong enough
to lift my carry-on bag

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.480
from the ground to the carousel.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.080
I stand at eye level with it.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.496
And those who work in that space
for safety purposes cannot help me

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200
and cannot do it for me.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.960
Design inhibits my autonomy
and my independence.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.480
But traveling at this size,
it isn't all bad.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.736
The leg room in economy
is like business class.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.640
(Laughter)

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.840
I often forget that I'm a little person.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.320
It's the physical environment
and society that remind me.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.080
Using a public bathroom
is an excruciating experience.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.056
I walk into the cubicle

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.938
but I can't reach the lock on the door.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.240
I'm creative and resilient.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400
I look around and see if there's
a bin that I can turn upside down.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600
Is it safe?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.240
Not really.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.960
Is it hygienic and sanitary?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640
Definitely not.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.380
But the alternative is much worse.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
If that doesn't work, I use my phone.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.216
It gives me an additional
four- to six-inch reach,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.920
and I try to jam the lock closed
with my iPhone.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.136
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive
had in mind when he designed the iPhone,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.360
but it works.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.440
The alternative
is that I approach a stranger.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.736
I apologize profusely

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.840
and I ask them to stand guard
outside my cubicle door.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.536
They do

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.520
and I emerge grateful

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.160
but absolutely mortified,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.776
and hope that they didn't notice

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.134
that I left the bathroom
without washing my hands.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.440
I carry hand sanitizer with me
every single day

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.576
because the sink, soap dispenser,
hand dryer and mirror

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.960
are all out of my reach.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.856
Now, the accessible bathroom
is somewhat of an option.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.280
In this space, I can reach
the lock on the door,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.200
the sink, the soap dispenser,
the hand dryer and the mirror.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.320
Yet, I cannot use the toilet.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.976
It is deliberately designed higher

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.160
so that wheelchair users
can transfer across with ease.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.560
This is a wonderful
and necessary innovation,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.680
but in the design world, when we describe
a new project or idea as accessible,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.880
what does that mean?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
Who is it accessible to?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.600
And whose needs
are not being accommodated for?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.496
Now, the bathroom is an example

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.040
of where design impinges upon my dignity,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.440
but the physical environment impacts
upon me in much more casual ways too,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480
something as simple
as ordering a cup of coffee.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.680
Now, I'll admit it.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.040
I drink far too much coffee.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.056
My order is a skinny vanilla latte,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.640
but I'm trying
to wean myself off the syrup.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.536
But the coffee shop,
it's not designed well,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.760
at least not for me.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.296
Queuing, I'm standing
beside the pastry cabinet

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.360
and the barista calls for the next order.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.400
"Next, please!" they shout.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.640
They can't see me.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.456
The person next to me in the queue
points to my existence

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.720
and everyone is embarrassed.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.520
I order as quick as I can
and I move along to collect my coffee.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.920
Now, think just for a second.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
Where do they put it?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.800
Up high and without a lid.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.376
Reaching up to collect a coffee
that I have paid for

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.840
is an incredibly dangerous experience.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.896
But design also impinges
on the clothes that I want to wear.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.560
I want garments
that reflect my personality.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.000
It's difficult to find
in the childrenswear department.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.920
And often womenswear
requires far too many alterations.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.320
I want shoes that affect my maturity,
professionalism and sophistication.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400
Instead, I'm offered sneakers
with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.976
Now, I'm not totally opposed
to light-up shoes.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.200
(Laughter)

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.496
But design also impacts
on such simple things,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.960
like sitting on a chair.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.440
I cannot go from a standing
to a seating position with grace.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.576
Due to the standards
of design heights of chairs,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.296
I have to crawl on my hands and knees

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.936
just to get on top of it,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.600
whilst also being conscious
that it might tip over at any stage.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.936
But whilst design impacts on me

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.736
whether it's a chair,
a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.936
I rely on and benefit

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.760
from the kindness of strangers.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.160
But not everybody is so nice.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.976
I'm reminded that I'm a little person

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.440
when a stranger points,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.720
stares,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.520
laughs,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.136
calls me a name,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.640
or takes a photograph of me.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.389
This happens almost every day.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.616
With the rise of social media,
it has given me an opportunity

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.600
and a platform to have a voice
as a blogger and as an activist,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.736
but it has also made me nervous

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.856
that I might become a meme

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.440
or a viral sensation,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800
all without my consent.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.936
So let's take a moment right now

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.560
to make something very clear.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.120
The word "midget" is a slur.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.480
It evolved from PT Barnum's era
of circuses and freak shows.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.360
Society has evolved.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.040
So should our vocabulary.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.216
Language is a powerful tool.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.240
It does not just name our society.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.160
It shapes it.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.296
I am incredibly proud
to be a little person,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.576
to have inherited
the condition of achondroplasia.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.840
But I am most proud to be Sinead.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.720
Achondroplasia is
the most common form of dwarfism.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.960
Achondroplasia translates
as "without cartilage formation."

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.496
I have short limbs
and achondroplastic facial features,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.840
my forehead and my nose.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.176
My arms do not straighten fully,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.080
but I can lick my elbow.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.021
I'm not showing you that one.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.680
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately
one in every 20,000 births.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.200
80 percent of little people
are born to two average-height parents.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.920
That means that anybody in this room
could have a child with achondroplasia.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.480
Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.160
I'd like to show you a photo of my family.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.296
My mother is average height,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.536
my father is a little person

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.560
and I am the eldest of five children.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.720
I have three sisters and one brother.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.240
They are all average height.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.576
I am incredibly fortunate
to have been born into a family

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.800
that cultivated
my curiosity and my tenacity,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.696
that protected me from the unkindness
and ignorance of strangers

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.896
and that armed me with the resilience,
creativity and confidence

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.560
that I needed to survive and manipulate
the physical environment and society.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.616
If I was to pinpoint any reason
why I am successful,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.760
it is because I was
and I am a loved child,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.456
now, a loved child
with a lot of sass and sarcasm,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.159
but a loved child nonetheless.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.320
In giving you an insight
into who I am today

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.200
I wanted to offer you a new perspective.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.656
I wanted to challenge the idea

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.240
that design is but a tool
to create function and beauty.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.280
Design greatly impacts
upon people's lives,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.680
all lives.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.056
Design is a way in which
we can feel included in the world,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.336
but it is also a way in which
we can uphold a person's dignity

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.720
and their human rights.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.296
Design can also inflict vulnerability

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.800
on a group whose needs aren't considered.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.160
So today, I want
your perceptions challenged.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.976
Who are we not designing for?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.816
How can we amplify their voices

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.440
and their experiences?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.400
What is the next step?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.976
Design is an enormous privilege,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.960
but it is a bigger responsibility.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.000
I want you to open your eyes.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.976
Thank you so much.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.760
(Applause)
