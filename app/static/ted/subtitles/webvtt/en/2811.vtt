00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.416
"These are the times,"

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.456
said Thomas Paine,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.360
"that try men's souls."

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.616
And they're trying ours now.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.816
This is a fateful moment
in the history of the West.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.840
We've seen divisive elections
and divided societies.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.240
We've seen a growth of extremism

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.160
in politics and religion,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.280
all of it fueled by anxiety,
uncertainty and fear,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.456
of a world that's changing
almost faster than we can bear,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.840
and the sure knowledge
that it's going to change faster still.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.896
I have a friend in Washington.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.096
I asked him, what was it like
being in America

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.360
during the recent presidential election?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.080
He said to me, "Well,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.880
it was like the man

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.760
sitting on the deck of the Titanic

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.296
with a glass of whiskey in his hand

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.096
and he's saying,
'I know I asked for ice --

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.200
(Laughter)

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440
but this is ridiculous.'"

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.976
So is there something we can do,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
each of us,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.216
to be able to face
the future without fear?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.560
I think there is.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.976
And one way into it is to see

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.896
that perhaps the most simple way
into a culture and into an age

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.896
is to ask: What do people worship?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.416
People have worshipped
so many different things --

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.320
the sun, the stars, the storm.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.240
Some people worship many gods,
some one, some none.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.920
In the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.896
people worshipped the nation,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.376
the Aryan race, the communist state.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
What do we worship?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.376
I think future anthropologists

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.480
will take a look at the books we read

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.416
on self-help, self-realization,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.640
self-esteem.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.216
They'll look at the way
we talk about morality

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.416
as being true to oneself,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.856
the way we talk about politics

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.656
as a matter of individual rights,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.016
and they'll look at this wonderful
new religious ritual we have created.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.240
You know the one?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480
Called the "selfie."

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.056
And I think they'll conclude
that what we worship in our time

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.840
is the self, the me, the I.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.880
And this is great.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320
It's liberating.
It's empowering. It's wonderful.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.176
But don't forget that biologically,
we're social animals.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.816
We've spent most
of our evolutionary history

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.080
in small groups.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.416
We need those face-to-face interactions

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.840
where we learn
the choreography of altruism

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.936
and where we create those spiritual goods

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.360
like friendship and trust
and loyalty and love

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.720
that redeem our solitude.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.720
When we have too much of the "I"
and too little of the "we,"

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.600
we can find ourselves vulnerable,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400
fearful and alone.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.056
It was no accident
that Sherry Turkle of MIT

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.176
called the book she wrote
on the impact of social media

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320
"Alone Together."

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.416
So I think the simplest way
of safeguarding the future "you"

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.496
is to strengthen the future "us"

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.776
in three dimensions:

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.816
the us of relationship,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
the us of identity

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.856
and the us of responsibility.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.456
So let me first
take the us of relationship.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.000
And here, forgive me if I get personal.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.880
Once upon a time,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.256
a very long time ago,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.936
I was a 20-year-old undergraduate

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.616
studying philosophy.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.496
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer
and Sartre and Camus.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.896
I was full of ontological uncertainty

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.456
and existential angst.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.256
It was terrific.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.056
(Laughter)

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.296
I was self-obsessed
and thoroughly unpleasant to know,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.000
until one day I saw

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.055
across the courtyard

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.456
a girl

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.056
who was everything that I wasn't.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.096
She radiated sunshine.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240
She emanated joy.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.576
I found out her name was Elaine.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.056
We met. We talked.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.496
We married.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.856
And 47 years, three children
and eight grandchildren later,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.416
I can safely say

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.376
it was the best decision
I ever took in my life,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.016
because it's the people not like us

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240
that make us grow.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.720
And that is why I think

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.120
we have to do just that.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.136
The trouble with Google filters,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.096
Facebook friends

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.856
and reading the news by narrowcasting
rather than broadcasting

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.696
means that we're surrounded
almost entirely by people like us

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.216
whose views, whose opinions,
whose prejudices, even,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.560
are just like ours.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.896
And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.296
that if we surround ourselves
with people with the same views as us,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.640
we get more extreme.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.216
I think we need to renew
those face-to-face encounters

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.160
with the people not like us.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.376
I think we need to do that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.456
in order to realize
that we can disagree strongly

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.776
and yet still stay friends.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.896
It's in those face-to-face encounters

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
that we discover
that the people not like us

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.400
are just people, like us.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.840
And actually, every time

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.936
we hold out the hand of friendship

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.976
to somebody not like us,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.960
whose class or creed
or color are different from ours,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.736
we heal

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.376
one of the fractures

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.176
of our wounded world.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.600
That is the us of relationship.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.560
Second is the us of identity.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.480
Let me give you a thought experiment.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.936
Have you been to Washington?
Have you seen the memorials?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.656
Absolutely fascinating.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.296
There's the Lincoln Memorial:

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.736
Gettysburg Address on one side,
Second Inaugural on the other.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.496
You go to the Jefferson Memorial,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.456
screeds of text.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.496
Martin Luther King Memorial,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.936
more than a dozen quotes
from his speeches.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.200
I didn't realize,
in America you read memorials.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.696
Now go to the equivalent
in London in Parliament Square

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.096
and you will see that the monument
to David Lloyd George

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.136
contains three words:

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.296
David Lloyd George.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.536
(Laughter)

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.336
Nelson Mandela gets two.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.696
Churchill gets just one:

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.936
Churchill.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.256
(Laughter)

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.776
Why the difference?
I'll tell you why the difference.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.096
Because America was from the outset
a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.296
so it had to create an identity

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.656
which it did by telling a story

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.336
which you learned at school,
you read on memorials

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.216
and you heard repeated
in presidential inaugural addresses.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.296
Britain until recently
wasn't a nation of immigrants,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.776
so it could take identity for granted.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.720
The trouble is now

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.536
that two things have happened
which shouldn't have happened together.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.856
The first thing is in the West
we've stopped telling this story

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.416
of who we are and why,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.680
even in America.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.016
And at the same time,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.896
immigration is higher
than it's ever been before.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.216
So when you tell a story
and your identity is strong,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.376
you can welcome the stranger,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.896
but when you stop telling the story,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.456
your identity gets weak

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.976
and you feel threatened by the stranger.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.576
And that's bad.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.896
I tell you, Jews have been scattered
and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.616
We never lost our identity.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.736
Why? Because at least once a year,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.496
on the festival of Passover,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.456
we told our story
and we taught it to our children

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.736
and we ate the unleavened
bread of affliction

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.176
and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.256
So we never lost our identity.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.976
I think collectively

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.856
we've got to get back
to telling our story,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.896
who we are, where we came from,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.040
what ideals by which we live.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.256
And if that happens,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.696
we will become strong enough

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.376
to welcome the stranger and say,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.496
"Come and share our lives,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.000
share our stories,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.320
share our aspirations and dreams."

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.776
That is the us of identity.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.120
And finally, the us of responsibility.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.096
Do you know something?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.736
My favorite phrase in all of politics,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.240
very American phrase,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.840
is: "We the people."

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.336
Why "we the people?"

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.560
Because it says that we all
share collective responsibility

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.160
for our collective future.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.680
And that's how things
really are and should be.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.256
Have you noticed how magical thinking

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.200
has taken over our politics?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.656
So we say, all you've got to do
is elect this strong leader

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.880
and he or she will solve
all our problems for us.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.840
Believe me, that is magical thinking.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.976
And then we get the extremes:

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.800
the far right, the far left,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.616
the extreme religious
and the extreme anti-religious,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.576
the far right dreaming
of a golden age that never was,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.376
the far left dreaming
of a utopia that never will be

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.416
and the religious and anti-religious
equally convinced

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.776
that all it takes is God
or the absence of God

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.120
to save us from ourselves.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.936
That, too, is magical thinking,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.616
because the only people
who will save us from ourselves

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.016
is we the people,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.360
all of us together.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.840
And when we do that,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.216
and when we move from the politics of me

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.616
to the politics of all of us together,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.440
we rediscover those beautiful,
counterintuitive truths:

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.840
that a nation is strong

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.400
when it cares for the weak,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.056
that it becomes rich

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.216
when it cares for the poor,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.856
it becomes invulnerable
when it cares about the vulnerable.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.296
That is what makes great nations.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.880
(Applause)

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.920
So here is my simple suggestion.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.960
It might just change your life,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.560
and it might just help
to begin to change the world.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.336
Do a search and replace operation

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.096
on the text of your mind,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.216
and wherever you encounter
the word "self,"

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.600
substitute the word "other."

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.656
So instead of self-help, other-help;

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.240
instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.216
And if you do that,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.160
you will begin to feel the power

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.856
of what for me is one
of the most moving sentences

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.440
in all of religious literature.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.280
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.496
I will fear no evil,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.560
for you are with me."

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.936
We can face any future without fear

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.696
so long as we know

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.440
we will not face it alone.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.440
So for the sake of the future "you,"

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.016
together let us strengthen

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.560
the future "us."

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.536
Thank you.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.160
(Applause)
