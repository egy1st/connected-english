WEBVTT

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.285
So, I love making tools
and sharing them with people.

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:06.508
I remember as a child,

00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:09.825
my first tool I built
was actually a microscope

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.521
that I built by stealing lenses
from my brother's eyeglasses.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.076
He wasn't that thrilled.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.270
But, you know, maybe
because of that moment,

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:19.447
30 years later,

00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.359
I'm still making microscopes.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.658
And the reason I built these tools
is for moments like this.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.979
(Video) Girl: I have
black things in my hair --

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.278
Manu Prakash: This is a school
in the Bay Area.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.304
(Video) MP: The living world
far supersedes our imagination

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.295
of how things actually work.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.770
(Video) Boy: Oh my God!

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:46.125
MP: Right -- oh my God!

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.622
I hadn't realized this would be
such a universal phrase.

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:52.923
Over the last two years,

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:54.114
in my lab,

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:56.213
we built 50,000 Foldscopes

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:59.147
and shipped them
to 130 countries in the world,

00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:01.757
at no cost to the kids we sent them to.

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:03.481
This year alone,

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.637
with the support of our community,

00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.141
we are planning to ship
a million microscopes

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.527
to kids around the world.

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.604
What does that do?

00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:15.384
It creates an inspiring community
of people around the world,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.080
learning and teaching each other,

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:21.194
from Kenya to Kampala
to Kathmandu to Kansas.

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:23.863
And one of the phenomenal things
that I love about this

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:25.443
is the sense of community.

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.263
There's a kid in Nicaragua

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.481
teaching others how to identify
mosquito species that carry dengue

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.923
by looking at the larva
under a microscope.

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:36.495
There's a pharmacologist
who came up with a new way

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.762
to detect fake drugs anywhere.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.461
There is a girl who wondered:

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.183
"How does glitter actually work?"

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:46.926
and discovered the physics
of crystalline formation in glitter.

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.318
There is an Argentinian doctor

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:53.604
who's trying to do field cervical cancer
screening with this tool.

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:57.366
And yours very truly found
a species of flea

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.166
that was dug inside my heel in my foot
one centimeter deep.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:07.578
Now, you might think
of these as anomalies.

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:09.995
But there is a method to this madness.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.847
I call this "frugal science" --

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:16.723
the idea of sharing
the experience of science,

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:18.462
and not just the information.

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.226
To remind you:

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.334
there are a billion people on this planet

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:24.873
who live with absolutely
no infrastructure:

00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:26.511
no roads,

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:27.917
no electricity

00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:29.727
and thus, no health care.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:35.203
Also, there a billion kids
on this planet that live in poverty.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.368
How are we supposed to inspire them

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:39.714
for the next generation
of solution makers?

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.012
There are health care workers
that we put on the line

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.954
to fight infectious diseases,

00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:49.435
to protect us with absolutely
bare-minimum tools and resources.

00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:52.178
So as a lab at Stanford,

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:56.139
I think of this from a context
of frugal science

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.748
and building solutions
for these communities.

00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:03.354
Often we think about being able to do
diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.545
I'll tell you two examples
today of new tools.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.374
One of them starts in Uganda.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:10.280
In 2013,

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:14.350
on a field trip to detect
schistosomiasis with Foldscopes,

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:16.932
I made a minor observation.

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.533
In a clinic,

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:19.896
in a far, remote area,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.508
I saw a centrifuge
being used as a doorstop.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:26.583
I mean -- quite literally, the doorstop.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.333
And I asked them and they said,

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.384
"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:33.937
so this piece of junk
is good as a doorstop."

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:37.326
Centrifuges, for some of you
who don't know,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.574
are the pinnacle tool to be able
to do sample processing.

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:43.340
You separate components
of blood or body fluids

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:45.824
to be able to detect
and identify pathogens.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.253
But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:51.471
cost around 1,000 dollars --

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.501
and really hard to carry out in the field.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.682
And of course,

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.140
they don't work without power.

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:57.556
Sound familiar?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.128
So we started thinking
about solving this problem,

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:01.702
and I came back --

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.392
kept thinking about toys.

00:04:03.818 --> 00:04:04.982
Now ...

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.788
I have a few with me here.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:09.919
I first started with yo-yos ...

00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:12.574
and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.

00:04:12.923 --> 00:04:14.604
Because these objects spin,

00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:15.790
we wondered,

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:18.171
could we actually use
the physics of these objects

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.904
to be able to build centrifuges?

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:23.747
This was possibly the worst
throw I could make.

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:25.929
But you might start realizing,

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.792
if you start exploring
the space of toys --

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.421
we tried these spinning tops,

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.327
and then in the lab,

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.433
we stumbled upon this wonder.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.256
It's the whirligig,
or a buzzer, or a rundle.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.697
A couple of strings and a little disk,

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.928
and if I push, it spins.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.694
How many of you have played
with this as a kid?

00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:48.566
This is called a button-on-a-string.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.226
OK, maybe 50 percent of you.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.808
What you didn't realize --

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.145
that this little object

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.532
is the oldest toy
in the history of mankind ...

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.652
5,000 years ago.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:04.375
We have found relics of this object
hidden around on our planet.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.045
Now the irony is,

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.804
we actually don't understand
how this little thing works.

00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:12.231
That's when I get excited.

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:14.878
So we got back to work,

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:16.692
wrote down a couple of equations.

00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:20.369
If you take the input torque
that you put in,

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:22.497
you take the drag on this disc,

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.426
and the twist drag on these strings,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.939
you should be able
to mathematically solve this.

00:05:26.963 --> 00:05:29.771
This is not the only equation in my talk.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.627
Ten pages of math later,

00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.510
we could actually write down
the complete analytical solution

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:35.808
for this dynamic system.

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:39.999
And out comes what we call "Paperfuge."

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:42.567
That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.258
who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:46.527
And to the left, you see
all the centrifuges

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.978
that we're trying to replace.

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:51.709
This little object that you see right here

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.184
is a disc, a couple
of strings and a handle.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.382
And when I spin

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.093
and I push,

00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:00.269
it starts to spin.

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.378
Now, when you realize,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.345
when you do the math,

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:08.069
when we calculate the rpm for this object,

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:12.825
mathematically, we should be able
to go all the way to a million rpm.

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.042
Now, there is a little twist
in human anatomy,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:18.141
because the resonant frequency
of this object is about 10 hertz,

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:19.969
and if you've ever played the piano,

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.087
you can't go higher
than two or three hertz.

00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:25.375
The maximum speed we've been able
to achieve with this object

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.328
is not 10,000 rpm,

00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:28.956
not 50,000 rpm --

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.905
120,000 rpm.

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:33.733
That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.964
If I was to stick you right here
and have it spin,

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:40.417
you would think about the types
of forces you would experience.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.679
One of the factors of a tool like this

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:45.697
is to be able to do diagnosis with this.

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.001
So, I'm going to do
a quick demo here, where --

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:54.037
this is a moment where I'm going
to make a little finger prick,

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.336
and a tiny drop of blood
is going to come out.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.981
If you don't like blood,
you don't have to look at it.

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.344
Here is a little lancet.

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:02.238
These lancets are available everywhere,

00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:03.785
completely passive.

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:07.395
And if I've had breakfast today ...

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:11.534
That didn't hurt at all.

00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:15.542
OK, I take a little capillary
with a drop of blood --

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:17.825
now this drop of blood has answers,

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.528
that's why I'm interested in it.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.377
It might actually tell me whether
I have malaria right now or not.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.233
I take a little capillary,

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.382
and you see it starts wicking in.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.156
I'm going to draw a little more blood.

00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:35.025
And that's good enough for right now.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:39.649
Now, I just seal this capillary
by putting it in clay.

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:45.772
And now that's sealed the sample.

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:47.925
We're going to take the sample,

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.913
mount it on Paperfuge.

00:07:57.092 --> 00:08:00.480
A little piece of tape
to make a sealed cavity.

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:03.870
So now the sample is completely enclosed.

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:09.400
And we are ready for a spin.

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.060
I'm pushing and pulling with this object.

00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:14.783
I'm going to load this up ...

00:08:16.277 --> 00:08:18.560
And you see the object starts spinning.

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:20.598
Unlike a regular centrifuge,

00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:24.401
this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:26.761
It goes back and forth, back and forth ...

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:29.349
And now I'm charging it up,

00:08:29.373 --> 00:08:31.201
and you see it builds momentum.

00:08:32.185 --> 00:08:34.797
And now -- I don't know
if you can hear this --

00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:36.360
30 seconds of this,

00:08:36.989 --> 00:08:41.314
and I should be able to separate
all the blood cells with the plasma.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.751
And the ratio of those blood 
cells to plasma --

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:46.789
(Applause)

00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:50.774
Already, if you see right here,

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:53.830
if you focus on this,

00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:56.399
you should be able to see
a separated volume

00:08:57.272 --> 00:08:59.130
of blood and plasma.

00:08:59.154 --> 00:09:03.077
And the ratio of that actually tells me
whether I might be anemic.

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:07.138
One of the aspects of this is,
we build many types of Paperfuges.

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:11.628
This one allows us to identify
malaria parasites

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.469
by running them for a little longer,

00:09:13.493 --> 00:09:17.059
and we can identify malaria parasites
that are in the blood

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:20.657
that we can separate out and detect
with something like a centrifuge.

00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:25.161
Another version of this allows me
to separate nucleic acids

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:28.742
to be able to do nucleic acid tests
out in the field itself.

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:33.917
Here is another version that allows me
to separate bulk samples,

00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.511
and then, finally,

00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:37.535
something new that we've been working on

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:42.354
to be able to implement the entire
multiplex test on an object like this.

00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:46.715
So where you do the sample preparation
and the chemistry in the same object.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.826
Now ...

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.120
this is all good,

00:09:50.144 --> 00:09:52.051
but when you start thinking about this,

00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:54.164
you have to share these tools with people.

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:57.570
And one of the things we did is --
we just got back from Madagascar;

00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:00.172
this is what clinical trials
for malaria look like --

00:10:00.196 --> 00:10:01.199
(Laughter)

00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:03.580
You can do this while having coffee.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.477
But most importantly,

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:09.563
this is a village six hours from any road.

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:14.599
We are in a room with one of the senior
members of the community

00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:16.136
and a health care worker.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.657
It really is this portion of the work
that excites me the most --

00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:20.839
that smile,

00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:24.737
to be able to share simple but powerful
tools with people around the world.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.781
Now, I forgot to tell you this,

00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:30.208
that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.392
OK, in the negative time I have left,

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.482
I'll tell you about the most recent --

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:37.626
(Laughter)

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.520
invention from our lab.

00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:40.897
It's called Abuzz --

00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:45.752
the idea that all of you
could help us fight mosquitoes;

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:48.043
you could all help us track our enemies.

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:52.055
These are enemies because they cause
malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.863
But the challenge is that we actually
don't know where our enemies are.

00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:59.866
The world map for where
mosquitoes are is missing.

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:02.046
So we started thinking about this.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.105
There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:05.532
and they're all very similar.

00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:06.995
Some of them are so identical

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:10.407
that even an entomologist cannot
identify them under a microscope.

00:11:11.096 --> 00:11:12.881
But they have an Achilles' heel.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:16.105
This is what mosquitoes flirting
with each other looks like.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:18.358
That's a male chasing a female.

00:11:18.382 --> 00:11:22.203
They're actually talking to each other
with their wingbeat frequencies.

00:11:22.227 --> 00:11:23.267
(Buzzing sound)

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.648
And thus, they have a signature.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:30.016
We realized that using a regular phone,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.581
a $5-10 flip phone --

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:34.707
how many remember what this object is?

00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:35.791
(Laughter)

00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:39.976
We can record these acoustic
signatures from mosquitoes.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.936
I'll tell you exactly how to do this.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.651
I caught some mosquitoes outside.

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:46.063
Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm not
going to release them.

00:11:46.087 --> 00:11:47.127
(Laughter)

00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:49.726
But I will tell you how
to record from this.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.192
All you do is tap them and they fly.

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:53.557
You can first test --

00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:55.333
I can actually hear that.

00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:57.811
And you bring your phone,
which has microphones --

00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:00.201
it turns out the mics
are so damn good already,

00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.465
even on regular phones,

00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:03.922
that you can pick up
this near-field signature.

00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:06.084
And since I'm out of time,

00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:09.800
let me just play the recording
that I made a day ago.

00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:12.364
(Mosquitoes buzz)

00:12:12.388 --> 00:12:15.316
This is all the charming sound
that you heard before

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.524
that you all love.

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:20.207
One of the contexts of this

00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:23.445
is that being able to do this
with a regular cell phone

00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:26.629
allows us to map mosquito species.

00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:29.349
Using a flip phone,

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:32.351
we mapped one of the largest
acoustic databases

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:37.603
with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes
that carry human pathogens.

00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:39.306
And from this and machine learning,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.114
anybody who uploads this data,

00:12:41.138 --> 00:12:43.126
we can identify and tell the probability

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.984
of what species of mosquitoes
you're actually working with.

00:12:46.008 --> 00:12:48.823
We call this Abuzz,
and if any of you want to sign up,

00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.065
just go to the website.

00:12:50.523 --> 00:12:52.165
Let me close with something

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:54.490
that's very important
and dear to my heart.

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:59.451
One of the challenges of today
is we have terrible problems.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.373
We have a billion people
with absolutely no health care,

00:13:02.397 --> 00:13:04.522
climate change, biodiversity loss,

00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:05.731
on and on and on.

00:13:06.226 --> 00:13:09.176
And we hope that science
is going to provide the answer.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.738
But before you leave this theatre today,

00:13:11.762 --> 00:13:13.516
I want you to promise one thing.

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:16.303
We're going to make science accessible --

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:19.205
not just to the people who can afford it,

00:13:19.229 --> 00:13:21.111
but a billion others who can't.

00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:25.777
Let's make science and scientific
literacy a human right.

00:13:27.564 --> 00:13:32.239
The moment that you pass the tingling
feeling of making a discovery

00:13:32.263 --> 00:13:33.774
to another child,

00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:38.235
you're enabling them to be
the next group of people

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:40.367
who will actually solve these problems.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.566
Thank you.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.968
(Applause)
