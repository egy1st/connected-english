00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.047
I'm a journalist,

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.010
and I'm an immigrant.

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:08.264
And these two conditions define me.

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:09.706
I was born in Mexico,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.456
but I've spent more than half my life
reporting in the United States,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.464
a country which was itself
created by immigrants.

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:19.398
As a reporter

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.124
and as a foreigner,

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:23.487
I've learned that neutrality,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.516
silence

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.906
and fear aren't the best options --

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.134
not in journalism, nor in life.

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:32.337
Neutrality

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:36.432
is often an excuse that we journalists use

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:39.765
to hide from our true responsibility.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.603
What is that responsibility?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.539
It is to question

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.745
and to challenge

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.126
those in positions of power.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.609
That's what journalism is for.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.408
That's the beauty of journalism:

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:52.925
to question and challenge the powerful.

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.018
Of course, we have the obligation
to report reality as it is,

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.780
not how we would like it to be.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:02.260
In that sense, I agree
with the principle of objectivity:

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.742
if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.994
If there are a million unemployed people,
I say there are a million.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:09.298
But neutrality

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:12.584
won't necessarily lead me to the truth.

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.740
Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:20.433
and I present both sides of a news item --

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:23.219
the Democratic and the Republican,

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:24.880
the liberal and the conservative,

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.853
the government's and the opposition's --

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.336
in the end, I have no guarantee,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.551
nor are any of us guaranteed
that we'll know what's true

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:33.983
and what's not true.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:35.908
Life is much more complicated,

00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:40.947
and I believe journalism should reflect
that very complexity.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.196
To be clear: I refuse

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:46.676
to be a tape recorder.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.109
I didn't become a journalist
to be a tape recorder.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:52.441
I know what you're going to say:
no one uses tape recorders nowadays.

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:53.532
(Laughter)

00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:57.346
In that case, I refuse
to take out my cell phone

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.799
and hit the record button

00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:02.453
and point it in front of me
as if I were at a concert,

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:03.952
like a fan at a concert.

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:07.096
That is not true journalism.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.500
Contrary to what many people think,

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:14.073
journalists are making
value judgments all the time,

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:15.946
ethical and moral judgments.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.124
And we're always making decisions
that are exceedingly personal

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:23.987
and extraordinarily subjective.

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.215
For example:

00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:28.556
What happens if you're called
to cover a dictatorship,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.645
like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.489
or Fidel Castro's in Cuba?

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:37.262
Are you going to report only what
the general and commander want,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:38.706
or will you confront them?

00:02:39.177 --> 00:02:42.308
What happens if you find out
that in your country

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.917
or in the country next door,

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.953
students are disappearing

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:49.978
and hidden graves are appearing,

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.970
or that millions of dollars
are disappearing from the budget

00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:57.404
and that ex-presidents are magically
now multimillionaires?

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:59.477
Will you report only the official version?

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.727
Or what happens

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:02.950
if you're assigned to cover

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:08.969
the presidential elections
of the primary superpower,

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:13.376
and one of the candidates makes
comments that are racist,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:15.752
sexist

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:17.495
and xenophobic?

00:03:19.184 --> 00:03:20.421
That happened to me.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:23.154
And I want to tell you what I did,

00:03:23.178 --> 00:03:25.746
but first, let me explain
where I'm coming from,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.916
so you can understand my reaction.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.574
I grew up in Mexico City,
the oldest of five brothers,

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:38.270
and our family simply couldn't afford
to pay for all of our college tuition.

00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:41.708
So I studied in the morning,
and worked in the afternoon.

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:43.225
Eventually,

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:47.131
I got the job I had always wanted:

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:48.480
television reporter.

00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:50.204
It was a big opportunity.

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:52.977
But as I was working on
my third story, I ended up

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.229
criticizing the president,

00:03:55.856 --> 00:03:59.310
and questioning the lack
of democracy in Mexico.

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:04.205
In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000,
elections were always rigged;

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.373
the incumbent president
would hand-pick his successor.

00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:11.759
That's not true democracy.

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.788
To me it seemed like a brilliant idea
to expose the president,

00:04:14.812 --> 00:04:16.039
but to my boss --

00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.896
(Laughter)

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.126
My boss didn't think
it was such a great idea.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.877
At that time, the presidential office,
Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:25.375
against the media.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.161
My boss, who, aside from being in charge
of the show I worked for,

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:33.040
was also in charge of a soccer team.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.872
I always suspected that he was more
interested in goals

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.274
than in the news.

00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:38.616
He censored my report.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.251
He asked me to change it, I said no,

00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.211
so he put another journalist on the story

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:46.788
to write what I was supposed to say.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.554
I did not want to be
a censored journalist.

00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:53.833
I don't know where I found the strength,

00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:55.625
but I wrote my letter of resignation.

00:04:56.152 --> 00:05:00.458
And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:03.854
I made the most difficult and most
transcendental decision of my life.

00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:06.031
Not only did I resign from television,

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.934
but I had also decided
to leave my country.

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:13.225
I sold my car, a beat-up
little red Volkswagen,

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:15.040
came up with some money

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.838
and said goodbye to my family,

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.061
to my friends,

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:19.441
to my streets,

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:21.554
to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos --

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:22.855
(Laughter)

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.076
and I bought a one-way ticket

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.622
to Los Angeles, California.

00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:28.530
And so I became

00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:34.058
one of the 250 million immigrants
that exist in the world.

00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:35.898
Ask any immigrant

00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:38.468
about the first day they arrived
in their new country,

00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:41.219
and you'll find that they remember
absolutely everything,

00:05:41.243 --> 00:05:43.301
like it was a movie with background music.

00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:47.317
In my case, I arrived in Los Angeles,
the sun was setting,

00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.082
and everything I owned --

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:51.714
a guitar, a suitcase and some documents --

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:53.599
I could carry all of it

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.298
with my two hands.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:58.264
That feeling of absolute freedom,

00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:00.069
I haven't experienced since.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.744
And I survived with what little I had.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.565
I obtained a student visa; I was studying.

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:11.111
I ate a lot of lettuce and bread,
because that's all I had.

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:13.214
Finally, in 1984,

00:06:14.188 --> 00:06:18.411
I landed my first job as a TV reporter
in the United States.

00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:22.482
And the first thing I noticed
was that in the US,

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:24.689
my colleagues criticized --
and mercilessly --

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:26.198
then president Ronald Reagan,

00:06:26.222 --> 00:06:29.110
and absolutely nothing happened;
no one censored them.

00:06:29.134 --> 00:06:30.374
And I thought:

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:32.344
I love this country.

00:06:32.368 --> 00:06:35.302
(Laughter)

00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:38.698
(Applause)

00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:40.260
And that's how it's been

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.489
for more than 30 years:

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.291
reporting with total freedom,

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:48.221
and being treated as an equal
despite being an immigrant --

00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:49.895
until, without warning,

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.494
I was assigned to cover the recent
US presidential election.

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:59.582
On June 16, 2015,

00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:04.421
a candidate who would eventually become
the president of the United States

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:07.431
said that Mexican immigrants

00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:10.046
were criminals,

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:13.084
drug traffickers

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:14.268
and rapists.

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:15.476
And I knew

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:17.457
that he was lying.

00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:20.322
I knew he was wrong
for one very simple reason:

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:21.858
I'm a Mexican immigrant.

00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:23.816
And we're not like that.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.198
So I did what any other reporter
would have done:

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:29.998
I wrote him a letter by hand

00:07:31.173 --> 00:07:32.944
requesting an interview,

00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:35.346
and I sent it to his Tower in New York.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.600
The next day

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:38.484
I was at work,

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:42.081
and I suddenly began to receive
hundreds of calls and texts

00:07:42.105 --> 00:07:43.594
on my cell phone,

00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:45.160
some more insulting than others.

00:07:45.184 --> 00:07:48.681
I didn't know what was happening
until my friend came into my office

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:52.473
and said, "They published
your cell number online."

00:07:53.608 --> 00:07:55.053
They actually did that.

00:07:55.944 --> 00:07:59.318
Here's the letter they sent

00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:01.560
where they gave out my number.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.642
Don't bother writing it down, OK?
I already changed it.

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:06.178
(Laughter)

00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:07.810
But I learned two things.

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:11.373
The first one is that you should
never, never, ever

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:15.174
give your cell number to Donald Trump.

00:08:15.198 --> 00:08:18.002
(Laughter)

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:21.402
(Applause)

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:25.763
The second lesson was that
I needed to stop being neutral

00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:26.948
at that point.

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:29.653
From then on, my mission
as a journalist changed.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:32.299
I would confront the candidate

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:33.972
and show that he was wrong,

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:37.346
that what he said about immigrants
in the US was not true.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.788
Let me give you some figures.

00:08:38.812 --> 00:08:42.982
Ninety-seven percent of all undocumented
people in the United States

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.314
are good people.

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:47.191
Less than three percent
have committed a serious crime,

00:08:47.215 --> 00:08:48.947
or "felony," as they say in English.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:53.541
In comparison, six percent of US citizens
have committed a serious crime.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:59.403
The conclusion is that undocumented
immigrants behave much better

00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:00.940
than US citizens.

00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:03.808
Based on that data, I made a plan.

00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:07.157
Eight weeks after they published
my cell number,

00:09:08.054 --> 00:09:10.769
I obtained a press pass
for a press conference

00:09:10.793 --> 00:09:14.217
for the candidate
gaining momentum in the polls.

00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:15.779
I decided to confront him

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:17.716
in person.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.674
But ...

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:23.927
things didn't turn out exactly
as I had planned; watch:

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:28.431
[Donald Trump Press Conference
Dubuque, Iowa]

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:34.089
(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump,
I have a question about immigration.

00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.979
Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:38.440
JR: Your immigration plan
is full of empty promises.

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.997
DT: Excuse me, you weren't called.
Sit down. Sit down!

00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.699
JR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrant
and as a US citizen,

00:09:43.723 --> 00:09:45.398
I have the right to ask a question.

00:09:45.422 --> 00:09:47.705
DT: No you don't.
JR: I have the right to ask --

00:09:47.729 --> 00:09:48.922
DT: Go back to Univision.

00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:50.142
JR: This is the question:

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:52.598
You cannot deport 11 million people.

00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:56.171
You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.880
You cannot deny citizenship
to children in this country.

00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:01.845
DT: Sit down.
JR: And with those ideas --

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.021
DT: You weren't called.

00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:05.688
JR: I'm a reporter and I have --
Don't touch me, sir.

00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:08.691
Guard 1: Please don't disrupt.
You're being disruptive.

00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:12.273
JR: I have the right to ask a question.
G1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir.

00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:14.318
Guard 2: Do you have
your media credential?

00:10:14.342 --> 00:10:15.495
JR: I have the right --

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.528
G2: Where? Let me see.
JR: It's over there.

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:19.282
Man: Whoever's coming out, stay out.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.148
G2: You've just got to wait your turn.

00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:23.199
Man: You're very rude. It's not about you.

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.751
JR: It's not about you --
Man: Get out of my country!

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:26.944
Man: It's not about you.

00:10:26.968 --> 00:10:28.220
JR: I'm a US citizen, too.

00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:30.921
Man: Well ...whatever.
No, Univision. It's not about you.

00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:33.584
JR: It's not about you.
It's about the United States.

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:39.188
(Applause)

00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:49.261
(Applause ends)

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.786
Whenever I see that video,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.100
the first thing I always
think is that hate

00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:57.393
is contagious.

00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:01.707
If you notice, after the candidate says,
"Go back to Univision" -- that's code;

00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:03.926
what he's telling me
is, "Get out of here."

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.787
One member of his entourage,
as if he had been given permission, said,

00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:10.206
"Get out of my country,"

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.034
not knowing that I'm also a US citizen.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.596
After watching this video many times,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.614
I also think that in order
to break free from neutrality --

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.187
and for it to be a true break --

00:11:22.211 --> 00:11:24.383
one has to lose their fear,

00:11:24.407 --> 00:11:26.612
and then learn how to say, "No;

00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:28.125
I'm not going to be quiet.

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:30.282
I'm not going to sit down.

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:32.428
And I'm not going to leave."

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:34.460
The word "no" --

00:11:34.484 --> 00:11:39.089
(Applause)

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:42.985
"no" is the most powerful word
that exists in any language,

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:46.281
and it always precedes
any important change in our lives.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.498
And I think there's enormous dignity

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:50.452
and it generates a great deal of respect

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:52.005
to be able to step back

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:53.640
and to push back and say,

00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:55.355
"No."

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:57.961
Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.319
Nobel Peace Prize recipient

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:02.157
and who, unfortunately,
we lost very recently --

00:12:02.181 --> 00:12:04.508
said some very wise words:

00:12:04.532 --> 00:12:05.941
"We must take a side.

00:12:06.956 --> 00:12:09.472
Neutrality helps only the oppressor,

00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:10.647
never the victim."

00:12:10.671 --> 00:12:11.916
And he's completely right.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.782
We journalists are obligated
to take sides in certain circumstances;

00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:17.235
in cases of racism,

00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:18.858
discrimination,

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:20.797
corruption,

00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:22.305
lying to the public,

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:24.241
dictatorships and human rights,

00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:27.192
we need to set aside
neutrality and indifference.

00:12:27.796 --> 00:12:29.772
Spanish has a great word

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.359
to describe the stance
that journalists should take.

00:12:34.383 --> 00:12:36.621
The word is 
"contrapoder [anti-establishment]."

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:39.906
Basically, we journalists
should be on the opposite side

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:42.158
from those in power.

00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:44.756
But if you're in bed with politicians,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.477
if you go to the baptism or wedding
of the governor's son

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.550
or if you want to be
the president's buddy,

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:51.415
how are you going to criticize them?

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:54.728
When I'm assigned to interview
a powerful or influential person,

00:12:54.752 --> 00:12:56.501
I always keep two things in mind:

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:59.269
if I don't ask this difficult
and uncomfortable question,

00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:00.573
no one else is going to;

00:13:01.898 --> 00:13:04.841
and that I'm never going to see
this person again.

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:08.005
So I'm not looking to make
a good impression

00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.256
or to forge a connection.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.523
In the end, if I have to choose
between being the president's friend

00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:14.705
or enemy,

00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:17.553
I always prefer to be their enemy.

00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:20.347
In closing:

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.234
I know this is a difficult time
to be an immigrant and a journalist,

00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:28.136
but now more than ever,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.321
we need journalists who are prepared,

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:32.916
at any given moment,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.734
to set neutrality aside.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.195
Personally, I feel like
I've been preparing for this moment

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:39.373
my whole life.

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:41.683
When they censored me when I was 24,

00:13:41.707 --> 00:13:48.377
I learned that neutrality, fear
and silence often make you an accomplice

00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.258
in crime, abuse

00:13:50.847 --> 00:13:52.394
and injustice.

00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:54.443
And being an accomplice to power

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:57.007
is never good journalism.

00:13:57.574 --> 00:14:00.244
Now, at 59 years old,

00:14:00.268 --> 00:14:02.082
I only hope to have a tiny bit

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.097
of the courage and mental
clarity I had at 24,

00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:08.594
and that way, never again

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:10.838
remain quiet.

00:14:10.862 --> 00:14:12.130
Thank you very much.

00:14:12.154 --> 00:14:14.793
(Applause)

00:14:14.817 --> 00:14:16.000
Thank you.

00:14:16.024 --> 00:14:18.024
(Applause)
