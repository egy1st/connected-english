WEBVTT

00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.240
All right, let's get up
our picture of the earth.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.976
The earth is pretty awesome.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.429
I'm a geologist, so I get
pretty psyched about this,

00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:09.816
but the earth is great.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.296
It's powerful, it's dynamic,
it's constantly changing.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.120
It's a pretty exciting place to live.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.976
But I want to share with you guys today
my perspective as a geologist

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.216
in how understanding earth's past

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.736
can help inform and guide
decisions that we make today

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.840
about how to sustainably live
on earth's surface.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.256
So there's a lot of exciting things
that go on on the surface of the earth.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.840
If we zoom in here a little bit,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.016
I want to talk to you guys a little bit
about one of the things that happens.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.786
Material get shuffled around
earth's surface all the time,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.036
and one of the big thing that happens
is material from high mountains

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.536
gets eroded and transported
and deposited in the sea.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.516
And this process is ongoing all the time,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.936
and it has huge effects
on how the landscape works.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.856
So this example here in south India --

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.376
we have some of the biggest
mountains in the world,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.376
and you can see in this satellite photo

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.576
rivers transporting material
from those mountains out to the sea.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.775
You can think of these rivers
like bulldozers.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
They're basically taking these mountains
and pushing them down towards the sea.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.256
We'll give you guys an example here.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.616
So we zoom in a little bit.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.176
I want to talk to you guys
specifically about a river.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.856
We can see these beautiful patterns
that the rivers make

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.976
as they're pushing material
down to the sea,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.616
but these patterns aren't static.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.326
These rivers are wiggling
and jumping around quite a bit,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.316
and it can have big impacts on our lives.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.736
So an example of this
is this is the Kosi River.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.416
So the Kosi River
has this nice c-shaped pathway,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.896
and it exits the big mountains of Nepal

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.056
carrying with it a ton of material,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.046
a lot of sediments that's being
eroded from the high mountains,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.926
and it spreads out across India

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.270
and moves this material.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.856
So we're going to zoom in to this area

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.309
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
about what happened with the Kosi.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.896
It's an example of how dynamic
these systems can be.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.496
So this is a satellite image
from August of 2008,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.216
and this satellite image is colored

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.416
so that vegetations or plants
show up as green

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.096
and water shows up as blue.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.656
So here again you can see
that c-shaped pathway

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.600
that this river takes as it exits Nepal.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.136
And now this is monsoon season.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.656
August is monsoon season
in this region of the world,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.576
and anyone that lives near a river
is no stranger to flooding

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.172
and the hazards and inconveniences
at minimum that are associated with that.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.696
But something interesting
happened in 2008,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.616
and this river moved in a way
that's very different.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.640
It flooded in a way that's very
different than it normally does.

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:28.416
So the Kosi River is flowing down here,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.016
but sometimes as these rivers
are bulldozing sediment,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.296
they kind of get clogged,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.456
and these clogs can
actually cause the rivers

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.176
to shift their course dramatically.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.056
So this satellite image
is from just two weeks later.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.016
Here's the previous pathway,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.656
that c-shaped pathway,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.776
and you notice it's not blue anymore.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.776
But now what we have is this blue pathway

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.256
that cuts down the middle
of the field of view here.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.616
What happened is
the Kosi River jumped its banks,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.336
and for reference,
the scale bar here is 40 miles.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.880
This river moved
over 30 miles very abruptly.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.736
So this river got clogged
and it jumped its banks.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.856
Here's an image from about a week later,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.136
and you can see
these are the previous pathways,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.816
and you can see this process
of river-jumping continues

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.412
as this river moves farther away
from its major course.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.976
So you can imagine
in landscapes like this,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.616
where rivers move around frequently,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.136
it's really important to understand when,
where and how they're going to jump.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.040
But these kinds of processes
also happen a lot closer to home as well.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.456
So in the United States,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.536
we have the Mississippi River
that drains most of the continental US.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.936
It pushes material
from the Rocky Mountains

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.496
and from the Great Plains.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.736
It drains it and moves it
all the way across America

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680
and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.776
So this is the course of the Mississippi
that we're familiar with today,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.896
but it didn't always flow
in this direction.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.576
If we use the geologic record,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.320
we can reconstruct
where it went in the past.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.416
So for example, this red area here

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.976
is where we know the Mississippi River
flowed and deposited material

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.640
about 4,600 years ago.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.336
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.736
to follow the course
outlined here in orange.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.776
And it kept moving and it keeps moving.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.696
So here's about 2,000 years ago,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.416
a thousand years ago,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.656
700 years ago.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.096
And it was only
as recently as 500 years ago

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.959
that it occupied the pathway
that we're familiar with today.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.016
So these processes are really important,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.896
and especially here, this delta area,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.736
where these river-jumping events
in the Mississippi

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.576
are building land at the interface
of the land and the sea.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.336
This is really valuable real estate,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.616
and deltas like this are some of the most
densely populated areas on our planet.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.096
So understanding the dynamics
of these landscapes,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.256
how they formed and how they will
continue to change in the future

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.680
is really important
for the people that live there.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.016
So rivers also wiggle.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.936
These are sort of bigger jumps
that we've been talking about.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.216
I want to show you guys
some river wiggles here.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.776
So we're going to fly down
to the Amazon River basin,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.816
and here again we have a big river system

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.216
that is draining and moving and plowing
material from the Andean Mountains,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.056
transporting it across South America

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.760
and dumping it out
into the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.256
So if we zoom in here, you guys
can see these nice, curvy river pathways.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.256
Again, they're really beautiful,
but again, they're not static.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.016
These rivers wiggle around.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.656
We can use satellite imagery
over the last 30 or so years

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.816
to actually monitor how these change.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.016
So take a minute and just watch
any bend or curve in this river,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.016
and you'll see it doesn't stay
in the same place for very long.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.320
It changes and evolves
and warps its pattern.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.216
If you look in this area in particular,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.216
I want you guys to notice
there's a sort of a loop in the river

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.656
that gets completely cut off.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.256
It's almost like a whip cracking

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.960
and snaps off the pathway
of the river at a certain spot.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.976
So just for reference, again,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.936
in this location, that river
changed its course over four miles

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.640
over the course of a season or two.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.976
So the landscapes
that we live in on earth,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.416
as this material
is being eroded from the mountains

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.776
and transported to the sea,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.416
are wiggling around all the time.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.896
They're changing all the time,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.376
and we need to be able
to understand these processes

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.136
so we can manage and live
sustainably on these landscapes.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.216
But it's hard to do
if the only information we have

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.576
is what's going on today
at earth's surface.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.656
Right? We don't have
a lot of observations.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.496
We only have 30 years' worth
of satellite photos, for example.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.416
We need more observations
to understand these processes more.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.056
And additionally, we need to know

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.296
how these landscapes are going
to respond to changing climate

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.576
and to changing land use

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.440
as we continue to occupy
and modify earth's surface.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.696
So this is where the rocks come in.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.216
So as rivers flow,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.136
as they're bulldozing material
from the mountains to the sea,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.616
sometimes bits of sand and clay
and rock get stuck in the ground.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.336
And that stuff that gets stuck
in the ground gets buried,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.096
and through time, we get
big, thick accumulations of sediments

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.136
that eventually turn into rocks.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.736
What this means is that we can
go to places like this,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.456
where we see big, thick stacks
of sedimentary rocks,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.976
and go back in time

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.736
and see what the landscapes
looked like in the past.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.896
We can do this to help reconstruct

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.240
and understand
how earth landscapes evolve.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.776
This is pretty convenient, too,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.776
because the earth has had
sort of an epic history. Right?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.616
So this video here
is a reconstruction of paleogeography

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.256
for just the first
600 million years of earth's history.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.256
So just a little bit of time here.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.016
So as the plates move around,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.176
we know climate has changed,
sea level has changed,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.856
we have a lot of different
types of landscapes

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.616
and different types of environments
that we can go back --

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.016
if we have a time machine --

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.376
we can go back and look at,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.136
and we do indeed have a time machine

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.496
because we can look at the rocks
that were deposited at these times.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.536
So I'm going to give you
an example of this

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.776
and take you to a special
time in earth's past.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.016
About 55 million years ago,
there was a really abrupt warming event,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.536
and what happened was
a whole bunch of carbon dioxide

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.376
was released into earth's atmosphere,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.256
and it caused a rapid
and pretty extreme global warming event.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.936
And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.936
that there were things
like crocodiles and palm trees

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.976
as far north as Canada
and as far south as Patagonia.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.176
So this was a pretty warm time
and it happened really abruptly.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.416
So what we can do

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.496
is we can go back and find rocks
that were deposited at this time

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.120
and reconstruct how the landscape changed
in response to this warming event.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.456
So here, yay, rocks.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.816
(Laughter)

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.576
Here's a pile of rocks.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.216
This yellow blob here,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.976
this is actually a fossil river,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.667
so just like this cartoon I showed,

00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.976
these are deposits that were
laid down 55 million years ago.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.096
As geologists, we can go
and look at these up close

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.549
and reconstruct the landscape.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.736
So here's another example.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.216
The yellow blob here is a fossil river.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.776
Here's another one above it.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.096
We can go and look in detail
and make measurements and observations,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.496
and we can measure features.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.896
For example, the features
I just highlighted there

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.376
tell us that this particular river
was probably about three feet deep.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.496
You could wade
across this cute little stream

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.760
if you were walking around
55 million years ago.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.376
The reddish stuff that's above
and below those channels,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.176
those are ancient soil deposits.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.056
So we can look at those to tell us
what lived and grew on the landscape

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.640
and to understand how these rivers
were interacting with their floodplains.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.056
So we can look in detail
and reconstruct with some specificity

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.936
how these rivers flowed
and what the landscapes looked like.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.440
So when we do this
for this particular place

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.376
at this time,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.136
if we look what happened
before this abrupt warming event,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.776
the rivers kind of carved their way
down from the mountains to the sea,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.936
and they looked maybe similar to what
I showed you in the Amazon River basin.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.416
But right at the onset
of this climate change event,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.920
the rivers change dramatically.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.336
All of a sudden they got much broader,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.920
and they started to slide back and forth
across the landscape more readily.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.776
Eventually, the rivers reverted
back to a state that was more similar

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.616
to what they would have looked like
before this climate event,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.280
but it took a long, long time.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.096
So we can go back in earth's time
and do these kinds of reconstructions

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.736
and understand how
earth's landscape has changed

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.536
in response to a climate event like this
or a land use event.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.656
So some of the ways that rivers change

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.456
or the reasons that rivers change
their pattern and their movements

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.416
is because of things like with extra water
falling on the land's surface

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.376
when climate is hotter,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.936
we can move more sediment
and erode more sediment,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.800
and that changes how rivers behave.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.776
So ultimately,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.416
as long as earth's surface is our home,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.816
we need to carefully manage
the resources and risks

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.816
associated with living
in dynamic environments.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.776
And I think the only way
we can really do that sustainably

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.016
is if we include information

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.136
about how landscapes evolved
and behaved in earth's past.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.376
Thank you.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.840
(Applause)
