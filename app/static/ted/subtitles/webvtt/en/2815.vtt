00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:03.915
So, a few years ago I heard
an interesting rumor.

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:06.777
Apparently, the head
of a large pet food company

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.056
would go into the annual
shareholder's meeting

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.541
with can of dog food.

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.666
And he would eat the can of dog food.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.243
And this was his way of convincing them
that if it was good enough for him,

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:17.944
it was good enough for their pets.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.404
This strategy is now known
as "dogfooding,"

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.747
and it's a common strategy
in the business world.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.255
It doesn't mean everyone
goes in and eats dog food,

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.500
but businesspeople
will use their own products

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:29.061
to demonstrate that they feel --

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:30.790
that they're confident in them.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:32.739
Now, this is a widespread practice,

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:35.858
but I think what's really interesting
is when you find exceptions

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:37.033
to this rule,

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.764
when you find cases of businesses
or people in businesses

00:00:39.788 --> 00:00:41.382
who don't use their own products.

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.527
Turns out there's one industry
where this happens in a common way,

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:45.711
in a pretty regular way,

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:48.169
and that is the screen-based
tech industry.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:52.587
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs,
when he was releasing the iPad,

00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.353
described the iPad as a device
that was "extraordinary."

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:58.917
"The best browsing experience
you've ever had;

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.674
way better than a laptop,
way better than a smartphone.

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:03.225
It's an incredible experience."

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.034
A couple of months later,
he was approached by a journalist

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:07.214
from the New York Times,

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:08.737
and they had a long phone call.

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.931
At the end of the call,

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:13.345
the journalist threw in a question
that seemed like a sort of softball.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.944
He said to him, "Your kids
must love the iPad."

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:18.432
There's an obvious answer to this,

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:21.075
but what Jobs said
really staggered the journalist.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.290
He was very surprised,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.889
because he said, "They haven't used it.

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:27.835
We limit how much technology
our kids use at home."

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.722
This is a very common thing
in the tech world.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:34.181
In fact, there's a school
quite near Silicon Valley

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:36.478
called the Waldorf School
of the Peninsula,

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:39.666
and they don't introduce screens
until the eighth grade.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.732
What's really interesting about the school

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:43.805
is that 75 percent
of the kids who go there

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.896
have parents who are high-level
Silicon Valley tech execs.

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:50.857
So when I heard about this, I thought
it was interesting and surprising,

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.913
and it pushed me to consider
what screens were doing to me

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:55.894
and to my family and the people I loved,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:57.180
and to people at large.

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.126
So for the last five years,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.183
as a professor of business and psychology,

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:03.911
I've been studying the effect
of screens on our lives.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.971
And I want to start by just focusing
on how much time they take from us,

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.501
and then we can talk about
what that time looks like.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.192
What I'm showing you here
is the average 24-hour workday

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:16.554
at three different points in history:

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.580
2007 -- 10 years ago --

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.063
2015

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:23.105
and then data that I collected,
actually, only last week.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.878
And a lot of things haven't changed

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:26.053
all that much.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.095
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half
to eight hours a day;

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.436
some people say that's declined slightly,
but it hasn't changed much.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.714
We work eight-and-a-half
to nine hours a day.

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:38.470
We engage in survival activities --

00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:41.621
these are things like eating
and bathing and looking after kids --

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:42.801
about three hours a day.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.353
That leaves this white space.

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.044
That's our personal time.

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.856
That space is incredibly important to us.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.168
That's the space where we do things
that make us individuals.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.293
That's where hobbies happen,
where we have close relationships,

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:58.199
where we really think about our lives,
where we get creative,

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.037
where we zoom back and try to work out

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:01.921
whether our lives have been meaningful.

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.773
We get some of that from work as well,

00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:05.712
but when people look back on their lives

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.740
and wonder what their lives have been like

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.007
at the end of their lives,

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:10.918
you look at the last things they say --

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:14.643
they are talking about those moments
that happen in that white personal space.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.670
So it's sacred; it's important to us.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:18.545
Now, what I'm going to do is show you

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.821
how much of that space
is taken up by screens across time.

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:23.170
In 2007,

00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:24.345
this much.

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.349
That was the year that Apple
introduced the first iPhone.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.571
Eight years later,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.460
this much.

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:33.107
Now, this much.

00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.569
That's how much time we spend
of that free time in front of our screens.

00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:39.896
This yellow area, this thin sliver,
is where the magic happens.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.502
That's where your humanity lives.

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:43.558
And right now, it's in a very small box.

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:45.868
So what do we do about this?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.249
Well, the first question is:

00:03:47.273 --> 00:03:49.132
What does that red space look like?

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:51.261
Now, of course, screens are miraculous

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:52.713
in a lot of ways.

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:53.994
I live in New York,

00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:56.016
a lot of my family lives in Australia,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470
and I have a one-year-old son.

00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:01.392
The way I've been able to introduce
them to him is with screens.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.506
I couldn't have done that
15 or 20 years ago

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.688
in quite the same way.

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.869
So there's a lot of good
that comes from them.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:08.739
One thing you can do is ask yourself:

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:10.846
What goes on during that time?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.308
How enriching are the apps
that we're using?

00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:14.606
And some are enriching.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.072
If you stop people while
they're using them and say,

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:18.684
"Tell us how you feel right now,"

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:21.104
they say they feel pretty good
about these apps --

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:24.488
those that focus on relaxation,
exercise, weather, reading,

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:26.055
education and health.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:29.213
They spend an average of nine
minutes a day on each of these.

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:31.567
These apps make them much less happy.

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.703
About half the people, when you interrupt
them and say, "How do you feel?"

00:04:35.727 --> 00:04:37.835
say they don't feel good about using them.

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:39.490
What's interesting about these --

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.224
dating, social networking, gaming,

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.974
entertainment, news, web browsing --

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.604
people spend 27 minutes a day
on each of these.

00:04:46.628 --> 00:04:50.180
We're spending three times longer
on the apps that don't make us happy.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:51.872
That doesn't seem very wise.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.424
One of the reasons we spend
so much time on these apps

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:56.600
that make us unhappy

00:04:56.624 --> 00:04:58.156
is they rob us of stopping cues.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.559
Stopping cues were everywhere
in the 20th century.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.447
They were baked into everything we did.

00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:05.887
A stopping cue is basically a signal
that it's time to move on,

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.608
to do something new,
to do something different.

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:11.828
And -- think about newspapers;
eventually you get to the end,

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:14.149
you fold the newspaper away,
you put it aside.

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:17.331
The same with magazines, books --
you get to the end of a chapter,

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:20.132
prompts you to consider
whether you want to continue.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:23.202
You watched a show on TV,
eventually the show would end,

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:25.631
and then you'd have a week
until the next one came.

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:27.409
There were stopping cues everywhere.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:31.183
But the way we consume media today
is such that there are no stopping cues.

00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:33.498
The news feed just rolls on,

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:37.195
and everything's bottomless:
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.361
email, text messaging, the news.

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:43.355
And when you do check
all sorts of other sources,

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.720
you can just keep going on and on and on.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:50.154
So, we can get a cue about what to do
from Western Europe,

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:53.579
where they seem to have a number
of pretty good ideas in the workplace.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.011
Here's one example.
This is a Dutch design firm.

00:05:56.035 --> 00:05:59.421
And what they've done
is rigged the desks to the ceiling.

00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:00.597
And at 6pm every day,

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.428
it doesn't matter who you're emailing
or what you're doing,

00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:04.929
the desks rise to the ceiling.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.061
(Laughter)

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:07.335
(Applause)

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:11.602
Four days a week, the space
turns into a yoga studio,

00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:13.257
one day a week, into a dance club.

00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.810
It's really up to you which ones
you stick around for.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.521
But this is a great stopping rule,

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.432
because it means at the end of the day,

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:21.493
everything stops, there's no way to work.

00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:24.961
At Daimler, the German car company,
they've got another great strategy.

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:26.515
When you go on vacation,

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:28.743
instead of saying,
"This person's on vacation,

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.490
they'll get back to you eventually,"

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:33.736
they say, "This person's on vacation,
so we've deleted your email.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.406
This person will never see
the email you just sent."

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.446
(Laughter)

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.111
"You can email back in a couple of weeks,

00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:41.621
or you can email someone else."

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:42.673
(Laughter)

00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:43.869
And so --

00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:47.535
(Applause)

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:50.520
You can imagine what that's like.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.002
You go on vacation,
and you're actually on vacation.

00:06:53.026 --> 00:06:54.995
The people who work at this company feel

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:57.381
that they actually get a break from work.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:06:59.322
But of course, that doesn't tell us much

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.645
about what we should do
at home in our own lives,

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.351
so I want to make some suggestions.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:07.868
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm,
I'm going to not use my phone.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:11.323
The problem is, 5 and 6pm
looks different on different days.

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.534
I think a far better strategy is to say,

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.027
I do certain things every day,

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.405
there are certain occasions
that happen every day,

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.688
like eating dinner.

00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:20.030
Sometimes I'll be alone,

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.560
sometimes with other people,

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:22.863
sometimes in a restaurant,

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:24.075
sometimes at home,

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.745
but the rule that I've adopted is:
I will never use my phone at the table.

00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:29.557
It's far away,

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.042
as far away as possible.

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:33.375
Because we're really bad
at resisting temptation.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.470
But when you have a stopping cue
that, every time dinner begins,

00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:37.650
my phone goes far away,

00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:39.342
you avoid temptation all together.

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.083
At first, it hurts.

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:42.729
I had massive FOMO.

00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:43.819
(Laughter)

00:07:43.843 --> 00:07:45.009
I struggled.

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:47.299
But what happens is, you get used to it.

00:07:47.323 --> 00:07:50.421
You overcome the withdrawal
the same way you would from a drug,

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:53.230
and what happens is, life becomes
more colorful, richer,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:54.409
more interesting --

00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.083
you have better conversations.

00:07:56.107 --> 00:07:59.131
You really connect with the people
who are there with you.

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:00.799
I think it's a fantastic strategy,

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:03.312
and we know it works,
because when people do this --

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:05.926
and I've tracked a lot of people
who have tried this --

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.120
it expands.

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:08.460
They feel so good about it,

00:08:08.484 --> 00:08:11.576
they start doing it for the first
hour of the day in the morning.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.725
They start putting their phones
on airplane mode on the weekend.

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:18.486
That way, your phone remains a camera,
but it's no longer a phone.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.845
It's a really powerful idea,

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:23.498
and we know people feel much better
about their lives when they do this.

00:08:23.973 --> 00:08:25.562
So what's the take home here?

00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:27.825
Screens are miraculous;
I've already said that,

00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:29.201
and I feel that it's true.

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:33.845
But the way we use them is a lot like
driving down a really fast, long road,

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:37.032
and you're in a car where the accelerator
is mashed to the floor,

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.104
it's kind of hard
to reach the brake pedal.

00:08:39.128 --> 00:08:40.620
You've got a choice.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.673
You can either glide by, past,
say, the beautiful ocean scenes

00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:48.793
and take snaps out the window --
that's the easy thing to do --

00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:52.357
or you can go out of your way
to move the car to the side of the road,

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:53.853
to push that brake pedal,

00:08:53.877 --> 00:08:55.030
to get out,

00:08:55.054 --> 00:08:56.935
take off your shoes and socks,

00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.224
take a couple of steps onto the sand,

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:01.488
feel what the sand feels like
under your feet,

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:02.663
walk to the ocean,

00:09:02.687 --> 00:09:04.800
and let the ocean lap at your ankles.

00:09:05.207 --> 00:09:08.022
Your life will be richer
and more meaningful

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.264
because you breathe in that experience,

00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:12.684
and because you've left
your phone in the car.

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:13.879
Thank you.

00:09:13.903 --> 00:09:16.204
(Applause)
