WEBVTT

00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:02.634
I am a climate scientist,

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:05.977
and I hate weather.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.407
I have spent too much time in California,

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.096
and I strongly feel that weather
should be optional.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.254
(Laughter)

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:16.319
So I don't want to experience clouds,

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:17.716
let alone study them.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.063
But clouds seem to follow me
wherever I go.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.303
The thing is, clouds are a real
challenge for climate science.

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:31.792
We don't know how they're going to react
as the planet heats up,

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:35.537
and hidden in that uncertainty

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.847
might be hope.

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.064
Maybe, just maybe,

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.769
clouds could slow down global warming,

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:46.440
and buy us a little bit more time
to get our act together,

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.180
which would be very convenient right now.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.690
I mean, even I could put up
with a few more cloudy days

00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:55.781
if clouds saved the planet.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.277
Now, we are sure about some things.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:02.220
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.640
we're emitting a lot of it,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.210
and the planet is heating up.

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:06.846
Case closed.

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.362
But I still go to work every day.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.670
It turns out that there is a lot
that we don't understand

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.161
about climate change.

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.078
In particular, we haven't answered

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.986
what seems to be a very
fundamental question.

00:01:21.584 --> 00:01:23.175
We know it's going to get hot,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.918
but we don't know exactly
how hot it's going to get.

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.611
Now, this is a really
easy question to answer

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.609
if one of you would like
to give me a time machine.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.094
But I'm going to be honest with you:

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:38.173
if I had a time machine,

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.483
I would not be hanging out
at this particular point in history.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.282
So in order to see the future,

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.920
we have to rely on the output
of computer simulations --

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:50.907
climate models, like this one.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:53.358
Now, in my line of work,

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:57.083
I encounter many very charming
people on the internet

00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:01.243
who like to tell me
that climate models are all wrong.

00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:04.258
And I would just like to say:

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:05.466
no kidding!

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.967
Seriously? I get paid to complain
about climate models.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:13.352
But we don't want models to be perfect.

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.320
We want them to be useful.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:17.577
I mean, think about it:

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.659
a computer simulation

00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:23.569
that's able to exactly
reproduce all of reality.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.955
That's not a climate model;

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.067
That's "The Matrix."

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:32.434
So, models are not crystal balls.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.149
They're research tools,

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:38.423
and the ways in which they're wrong
can actually teach us a lot.

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.346
For example:

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.364
different climate models
are largely able to capture

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:45.512
the warming that we've seen so far.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.304
But fast-forward to the end of the century

00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:50.657
under a business-as-usual scenario,

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.207
and climate models
don't really agree anymore.

00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:56.979
Yeah, they're all warming;
that's just basic physics.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.539
But some of them project catastrophe --

00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:03.414
more than five times the warming
we've seen already.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:06.341
And others are literally more chill.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.843
So why don't climate models agree
on how warm it's going to get?

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.481
Well, to a large extent,

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:18.085
it's because they don't agree
on what clouds will do in the future.

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:21.523
And that is because, just like me,

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:23.383
computers hate clouds.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.009
Computers hate clouds because
they're simultaneously very large

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.279
and very small.

00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:30.962
Clouds are formed

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:35.611
when microscopic water droplets
or ice crystals coalesce

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.221
around tiny particles.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:41.414
But at the same time, they cover
two-thirds of the earth's surface.

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.915
In order to really
accurately model clouds,

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.463
we'd need to track the behavior
of every water droplet and dust grain

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:50.929
in the entire atmosphere,

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:53.454
and there's no computer
powerful enough to do that.

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:56.617
So instead, we have to make a trade-off:

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.023
we can zoom in and get the details right,

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:03.025
but have no idea
what's going on worldwide;

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.972
or, we could sacrifice
realism at small scales

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:09.918
in order to see the bigger picture.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.539
Now, there's no one right answer,

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:14.118
no perfect way to do this,

00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:17.544
and different climate models
make different choices.

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:20.808
Now, it is unfortunate

00:04:20.832 --> 00:04:23.170
that computers struggle with clouds,

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:25.892
because clouds are crucially important

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.268
in regulating the temperature
of the planet.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:31.205
In fact, if all the clouds went away,

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.349
we would experience
profound climate changes.

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.462
But without clouds,

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:38.751
would it be warmer or colder?

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:41.052
The answer is both.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:45.038
So I'm going to be honest with you,
I am not a cloud spotter.

00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:47.332
My favorite type of cloud is none.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.876
But even I know that clouds
come in all shapes and sizes.

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:56.787
Low, thick clouds like these
are really good at blocking out the sun

00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:58.206
and ruining your barbecue,

00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:01.811
and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.056
largely let that sunlight stream through.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.013
Every sunny day is the same,

00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:09.520
but every cloudy day
is cloudy in its own way.

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:11.995
And it's this diversity

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:15.824
that can make the global impact of clouds
very hard to understand.

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:19.280
So to see this global effect of clouds,

00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:21.947
it really helps to take a selfie.

00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:26.639
It will never cease to blow my mind

00:05:26.663 --> 00:05:29.211
that we can see our planet
from outer space,

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.513
but we can't see all of it.

00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:33.758
Clouds are blocking the view.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.665
That's what they do.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.375
These low, thick clouds
are extremely effective sunshades.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.963
They turn back about 20 percent
of everything the sun sends us.

00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:47.178
That is a lot of wasted solar power.

00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:50.184
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.048
making the planet cooler.

00:05:52.072 --> 00:05:54.241
But that's not the only effect of clouds.

00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:56.518
Our planet has a temperature,

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:58.729
and like anything with a temperature,

00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:00.098
it's giving off heat.

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.975
We are radiating thermal energy
away into space,

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.844
and we can see this in the infrared.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.979
Once again, clouds are blocking the view.

00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:14.190
That's because high clouds live
in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:15.587
where it's very cold.

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:19.689
And this means that they lose
very little heat to space themselves.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:24.104
But at the same time, they block
the heat coming up from the planet below.

00:06:24.128 --> 00:06:27.003
The earth is trying to cool itself off,

00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:29.536
and high clouds are getting in the way.

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:34.237
The result is a very
powerful greenhouse effect.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.853
So, clouds play this very
large and dual role

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:40.448
in the climate system.

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.263
We've got low clouds that act
like a sunshade,

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:44.656
cooling the planet,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.599
and high clouds which act
like a greenhouse,

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:48.809
warming the planet.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:52.666
Right now, these two effects --
they don't cancel out.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.108
That sunshade -- it's a little
bit more powerful.

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:59.210
So if we got rid
of all the clouds tomorrow,

00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:02.448
which, for the record,
I am not advocating,

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.302
our planet would get warmer.

00:07:05.055 --> 00:07:08.786
So clearly, all of the clouds
are not going away.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.082
But climate change is change.

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:12.938
So we can ask:

00:07:12.962 --> 00:07:16.050
How will global warming change clouds?

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:19.690
But remember, clouds are so important

00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:21.812
in regulating the earth's temperature,

00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:24.547
and they both warm and cool the planet.

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.651
So even small changes to cloud cover

00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:29.756
could have profound consequences.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.200
So we might also ask:

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:35.333
How will clouds change global warming?

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.027
And that is where there might
be space for hope.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:42.889
If global warming triggers cloud changes

00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:48.065
that make for a less powerful greenhouse
or a more effective sunshade,

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.779
then that would enhance
the cooling power of clouds.

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:55.330
It would act in opposition
to global warming,

00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:58.324
and that's what's happening
in those climate models

00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.841
that project relatively muted warming.

00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.757
But climate models struggle with clouds,

00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:07.935
and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.

00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:10.921
Clouds could help us out
with global warming.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:13.432
They could also make it worse.

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:17.019
Now, we know that
climate change is happening

00:08:17.043 --> 00:08:18.808
because we can see it:

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:24.404
rising temperatures, melting icecaps,
shifts in rainfall patterns.

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.278
And you might think that we
could also see it in the clouds.

00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:30.818
But here's something else unfortunate:

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:33.513
clouds are really hard to see.

00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:36.480
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest

00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:38.703
is like, "I have some
suggestions for you."

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.751
(Laughter)

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:42.371
And you guys, we have tried looking up.

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:43.446
(Laughter)

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.489
But in order to do climate science,

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:51.646
we need to see all of the clouds,
everywhere, for a very long time.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.415
And that's what makes it hard.

00:08:54.097 --> 00:08:58.871
Now, nothing sees more clouds
than a satellite --

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:00.815
not even a British person.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:01.960
(Laughter)

00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:07.091
And fortunately, we do have
satellite observations of clouds

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:09.979
that, like me, date back to the 1980s.

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:14.296
But these satellites
were designed for weather,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.844
not climate.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:17.782
They weren't in it for the long haul.

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:20.492
So to get that long-term
trend information,

00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.291
we need to do climate science.

00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:25.433
We have to stitch together
the output of multiple satellites

00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:28.535
with different viewing angles and orbits

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:30.482
and carrying different camera equipment.

00:09:30.506 --> 00:09:31.728
And as a result,

00:09:31.752 --> 00:09:33.904
there are gaps in our knowledge.

00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:37.828
But even from this very cloudy picture,

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:41.015
we're starting to get hints
of a possible future.

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:44.248
When we looked at the observations,

00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:46.088
one thing jumped out at us:

00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:48.701
the clouds are moving.

00:09:49.693 --> 00:09:52.182
As the planet's temperature increases,

00:09:52.206 --> 00:09:54.138
high clouds rise up.

00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:58.916
They move to the colder
upper reaches of the atmosphere,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.603
and this means that even
as the planet heats up,

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:03.944
high clouds don't.

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:07.021
They remain at roughly
the same temperature.

00:10:07.045 --> 00:10:10.543
So they are not losing more heat to space.

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:13.604
But at the same time,
they're trapping more heat

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:15.361
from the warming planet below.

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.849
This intensifies the greenhouse effect.

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:23.540
High clouds are making
global warming worse.

00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:26.847
Clouds are moving
in other dimensions, too.

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:29.876
The atmospheric circulation,
that large-scale motion

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.818
of air and water in the atmosphere,

00:10:31.842 --> 00:10:33.229
is changing,

00:10:33.253 --> 00:10:35.517
and clouds are going with it.

00:10:37.216 --> 00:10:38.822
On large scales,

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:42.958
clouds seem to be moving
from the tropics toward the poles.

00:10:42.982 --> 00:10:45.519
It's kind of like your
grandparents in reverse.

00:10:46.207 --> 00:10:47.786
And this matters,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.659
because if your job
is to block incoming sunlight,

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:54.699
you are going to be much
more effective in the tropics

00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:56.920
under that intense tropical sun

00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:58.801
than you are in higher latitudes.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:01.142
So if this keeps up,

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:04.263
this will also make global warming worse.

00:11:04.287 --> 00:11:06.608
And what we have not found,

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.910
despite years of looking,

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.512
is any indication of the opposite.

00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:14.977
There is no observational evidence

00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.736
that clouds will substantially
slow down global warming.

00:11:20.141 --> 00:11:23.478
The earth is not going
to break its own fever.

00:11:24.193 --> 00:11:26.629
Now, there are still uncertainties here.

00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:29.452
We don't know for sure

00:11:29.476 --> 00:11:31.131
what the future holds.

00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:34.377
But we are sending our kids there,

00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:36.980
and they are never coming back.

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:41.564
I want them to be prepared
for what they'll face,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.543
and that is why it is so important

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:48.818
to keep our earth-observing
satellites up there

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.638
and to hire diverse and smart
and talented people

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:54.929
who do not hate clouds

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:56.888
to improve the climate models.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.093
But uncertainty is not ignorance.

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:03.525
We don't know everything,

00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:05.687
but we don't know nothing,

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.828
and we know what carbon dioxide does.

00:12:09.831 --> 00:12:12.995
I started my career as an astrophysicist,

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:14.501
so you can believe me

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:19.982
when I say that this is the greatest
place in the universe.

00:12:21.084 --> 00:12:23.901
Other planets might have liquid water.

00:12:24.988 --> 00:12:28.131
On earth, we have whiskey.

00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:30.168
(Laughter)

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:35.200
(Applause)

00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:38.417
We are so lucky to live here,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.684
but let's not push our luck.

00:12:42.476 --> 00:12:45.414
I don't think that clouds
will save the planet.

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:47.913
I think that's probably up to us.

00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:49.596
Thank you.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.570
(Applause)
