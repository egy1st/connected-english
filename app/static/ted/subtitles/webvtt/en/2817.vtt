00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.160
Just over a year ago,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.216
for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.520
I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.856
I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.080
and a coldness.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.296
And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.760
but definitely there.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.096
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.376
you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.136
but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.376
of a continuity between then and now.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.616
Coming round from
anesthesia is very different.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.136
I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.576
five years or even 50 years.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.056
I simply wasn't there.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.320
It was total oblivion.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.296
Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.496
It turns people into objects,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520
and then, we hope, back again into people.

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:48.776
And in this process

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040
is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.016
How does consciousness happen?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.256
Somehow, within each of our brains,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.176
the combined activity
of many billions of neurons,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.216
each one a tiny biological machine,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.056
is generating a conscious experience.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.016
And not just any conscious experience --

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.421
your conscious experience
right here and right now.

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:09.645
How does this happen?

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.616
Answering this question is so important

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.496
because consciousness
for each of us is all there is.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520
Without it there's no world,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.776
there's no self,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.336
there's nothing at all.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.313
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:25.417
whether it's through
mental illness or pain.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.336
And if we can experience
joy and suffering,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800
what about other animals?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.736
Might they be conscious, too?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.416
Do they also have a sense of self?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.576
And as computers get faster and smarter,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.176
maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.936
when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.440
I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.336
And I think this because
my research is telling me

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.016
that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.616
and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.336
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920
You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.896
In the story I'm going to tell you,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.256
our conscious experiences
of the world around us,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.616
and of ourselves within it,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.176
are kinds of controlled hallucinations

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.176
Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.936
about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.096
Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.336
But in fact,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.496
the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.296
If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.480
you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.120
and sometimes even philosophers.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.776
All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.520
and what happens when it goes wrong.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.016
And the strategy is very simple.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.016
I'd like you to think about consciousness

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.256
in the way that we've
come to think about life.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.896
At one time, people thought
the property of being alive

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.536
could not be explained
by physics and chemistry --

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.720
that life had to be
more than just mechanism.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.376
But people no longer think that.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.016
As biologists got on with the job

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.616
of explaining the properties
of living systems

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.456
in terms of physics and chemistry --

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.536
things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis --

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.376
the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.456
and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.480
like a force of life or an Ã©lan vital.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.736
So as with life, so with consciousness.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.056
Once we start explaining its properties

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.776
in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.216
the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.976
should start to fade away.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.720
At least that's the plan.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.536
So let's get started.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.536
What are the properties of consciousness?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.084
What should a science
of consciousness try to explain?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.656
Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.056
There are experiences
of the world around us,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.296
full of sights, sounds and smells,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.240
there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.560
And then there's conscious self.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.536
The specific experience
of being you or being me.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.576
The lead character in this inner movie,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.960
and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.296
Let's start with experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.055
and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.839
Imagine being a brain.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.255
You're locked inside a bony skull,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.496
trying to figure
what's out there in the world.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.536
There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.336
All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.536
which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.760
whatever they may be.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.656
So perception --
figuring out what's there --

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.536
has to be a process of informed guesswork

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.696
in which the brain combines
these sensory signals

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.776
with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.936
to form its best guess
of what caused those signals.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.656
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.040
What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.960
Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.376
You might have seen this illusion before,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.656
but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.736
If you look at those two patches, A and B,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.080
they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.016
But they are in fact
exactly the same shade.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.376
And I can illustrate this.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.616
If I put up a second version
of the image here

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.656
and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.336
you can see there's no difference.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.136
It's exactly the same shade of gray.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.816
And if you still don't believe me,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080
I'll bring the bar across
and join them up.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.040
It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.456
This isn't any kind of magic trick.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.896
It's the same shade of gray,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.120
but take it away again,
and it looks different.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.496
So what's happening here

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.336
is that the brain
is using its prior expectations

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.456
built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.176
that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.840
so that we see B as lighter
than it really is.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.176
Here's one more example,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.376
which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.696
to change what we consciously experience.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.920
Have a listen to this.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.480
(Distorted voice)

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.896
Sounded strange, right?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.349
Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.720
(Distorted voice)

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.136
Still strange.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.360
Now listen to this.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.976
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.336
(Laughter)

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.576
Which I do.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.416
So you heard some words there, right?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.536
Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.616
(Distorted voice)

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.136
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.360
Once more for luck.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.040
(Distorted voice)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.256
OK, so what's going on here?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.856
The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.080
hasn't changed at all.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.216
All that's changed
is your brain's best guess

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.296
of the causes of that sensory information.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.680
And that changes
what you consciously hear.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.696
All this puts the brain
basis of perception

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.176
in a bit of a different light.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.216
Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.776
from the outside world,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.296
it depends as much, if not more,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.240
on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.216
We don't just passively
perceive the world,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.936
we actively generate it.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.576
The world we experience
comes as much, if not more,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.936
from the inside out

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.280
as from the outside in.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.816
Let me give you
one more example of perception

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.720
as this active, constructive process.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.536
Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.536
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.896
on experience.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.816
In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world --

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.736
which is in this case Sussex campus --

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.320
into a psychedelic playground.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.616
We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.736
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.376
In this case, to see dogs.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.536
And you can see
this is a very strange thing.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.656
When perceptual
predictions are too strong,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.056
as they are here,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.976
the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.016
people might report in altered states,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.120
or perhaps even in psychosis.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.787
Now, think about this for a minute.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.256
If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.736
then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.776
but a controlled hallucination

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.696
in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.600
by sensory information from the world.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.176
In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.576
including right now.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.416
It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.640
we call that reality.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.216
(Laughter)

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.576
Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.416
the specific experience of being you,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.936
is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.976
This seems a very strange idea, right?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.136
Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.680
but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.416
For most of us,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.016
the experience of being a person

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.136
is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.376
that it's difficult
not to take it for granted.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.216
But we shouldn't take it for granted.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.456
There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.576
There's the experience of having a body

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.056
and of being a body.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.216
There are experiences
of perceiving the world

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.880
from a first person point of view.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.456
There are experiences
of intending to do things

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.200
and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.896
And there are experiences

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.816
of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.680
built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.496
Many experiments show,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.856
and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.776
that these different ways
in which we experience being a self

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.496
can all come apart.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.416
What this means is
the basic background experience

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.016
of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.696
Another experience,
which just like all others,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.920
requires explanation.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.496
So let's return to the bodily self.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.256
How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.536
and of having a body?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.416
Well, just the same principles apply.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.896
The brain makes its best guess

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.120
about what is and what is not
part of its body.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.616
And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.616
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.136
this is one you can do at home.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.056
All you need is one of these.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.336
(Laughter)

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.800
And a couple of paintbrushes.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.256
In the rubber hand illusion,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.256
a person's real hand is hidden from view,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.896
and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.176
Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.880
while the person stares at the fake hand.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.296
Now, for most people, after a while,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.416
this leads to the very uncanny sensation

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.040
that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.816
And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.216
on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.016
is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.256
that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.880
(Laughter)

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.496
So you can measure
all kinds of clever things.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.816
You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.096
but there's no need.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.056
It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.496
This means that even experiences
of what our body is

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.056
is a kind of best guessing --

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.560
a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.680
There's one more thing.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.776
We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.536
we also experience them from within.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.800
We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.576
And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.656
are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.336
how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.576
lots of things.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.080
This kind of perception,
which we call interoception,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.096
is rather overlooked.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.536
But it's critically important

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.896
because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body --

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520
well, that's what keeps us alive.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.816
Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.336
This is from our lab at Sussex.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.776
And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.176
which flashes red and back

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.456
either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.936
And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.080
people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.216
So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
in perceiving our bodies from within.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.336
There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.016
which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.096
from experiences of the world around us.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.816
When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects --

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.016
tables, chairs, rubber hands,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.776
people, you lot --

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.776
even my own body in the world,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.056
I can perceive it
as an object from the outside.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.136
But my experiences
of the body from within,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.576
they're not like that at all.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.656
I don't perceive my kidneys here,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.256
my liver here,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.536
my spleen ...

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.456
I don't know where my spleen is,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.856
but it's somewhere.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.776
I don't perceive my insides as objects.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.440
In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.880
And this is important, I think.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.696
Perception of the internal
state of the body

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.576
isn't about figuring out what's there,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.736
it's about control and regulation --

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.656
keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.520
that are compatible with survival.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.496
When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.616
we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.256
When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.440
we experience how well
or how badly that control is going.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.696
So our most basic experiences
of being a self,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.776
of being an embodied organism,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.760
are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.096
And when we follow this idea
all the way through,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.816
we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.576
since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.016
all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.656
We experience the world and ourselves

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.760
with, through and because of
our living bodies.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.960
Let me bring things together step-by-step.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.136
What we consciously see depends

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.456
on the brain's best guess
of what's out there.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.856
Our experienced world
comes from the inside out,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.120
not just the outside in.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.856
The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.720
of what is and what is not our body.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.136
And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.920
coming from deep inside the body.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.616
And finally,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.016
experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.720
than figuring out what's there.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.056
So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it --

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.336
well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.256
that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.040
to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.160
We predict ourselves into existence.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.000
Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.856
First, just as we can
misperceive the world,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.656
we can misperceive ourselves

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.816
when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.056
Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.696
because we can finally
get at the mechanisms

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.616
rather than just treating the symptoms

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.160
in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.936
Second:

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.776
what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.176
a software program running on a robot,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.416
however smart or sophisticated.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.056
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.336
whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.336
by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.000
Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.296
Finally,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.296
our own individual inner universe,

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.976
our way of being conscious,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.760
is just one possible
way of being conscious.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.816
And even human consciousness generally --

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.816
it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.496
Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.736
but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.360
shared with many other living creatures.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.880
Now, these are fundamental changes

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.016
in how we understand ourselves,

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.896
but I think they should be celebrated,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.296
because as so often in science,
from Copernicus --

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.320
we're not at the center of the universe --

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:11.576
to Darwin --

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.816
we're related to all other creatures --

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.040
to the present day.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.056
With a greater sense of understanding

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.496
comes a greater sense of wonder,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.376
and a greater realization

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.000
that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.120
And ...

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.096
when the end of consciousness comes,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.920
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.760
Nothing at all.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.696
Thank you.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:47.746
(Applause)
