00:00:01.015 --> 00:00:04.296
If you've been thinking about US politics

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.751
and trying to make sense of it
for the last year or so,

00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:12.466
you might have hit on something
like the following three propositions:

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:17.736
one, US partisanship
has never been so bad before;

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:20.768
two,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:24.566
for the first time,
it's geographically spatialized --

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.537
we're divided between the coasts,
which want to look outwards,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.678
and the center of the country,
which wants to look inwards;

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:32.981
and third,

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.521
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.911
I'm here to today to say
that all three of these propositions,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.939
all of which sound reasonable,

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.177
are not true.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.276
In fact,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.621
our US partisanship goes all the way back

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.177
to the very beginning of the republic.

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:58.510
It was geographically spatialized
in almost eerily the same way

00:00:58.534 --> 00:00:59.827
that it is today,

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.660
and it often has been
throughout US history.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:04.972
And last,

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:07.370
and by far most importantly,

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:11.696
we actually have
an extraordinary mechanism

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.858
that's designed to help us manage
factional disagreement and partisanship.

00:01:17.613 --> 00:01:20.422
That technology is the Constitution.

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:27.155
And this is an evolving, subtly,
supplely designed entity

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:28.719
that has the specific purpose

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:32.228
of teaching us how to manage
factional disagreement

00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:34.146
where it's possible to do that,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.851
and giving us techniques
for overcoming that disagreement

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.186
when that's possible.

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.462
Now, in order to tell you the story,

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:46.750
I want to go back
to a pivotal moment in US history,

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:47.929
and that is the moment

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:51.500
when factional disagreement
and partisanship was born.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.796
There actually was a birth moment --

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.031
a moment in US history
when partisanship snapped into place.

00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:03.799
The person who's at the core
of that story is James Madison.

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:06.921
And at the moment that this began,

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.430
James Madison was riding high.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.651
He himself was the Einstein
of not only the US Constitution,

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.140
but of constitutional thought
more globally,

00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:19.193
and, to give him his due,

00:02:19.217 --> 00:02:20.422
he knew it.

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:24.419
In a period of time of just three years,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.801
from 1785 to 1788,

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:33.224
he had conceived, theorized,
designed, passed and gotten ratified

00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:34.789
the US Constitution.

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:37.050
And just to give you
some sense of the enormity

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.146
of what that accomplishment actually was,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.065
although Madison
couldn't have known it at the time,

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:47.400
today that same constitutional technology
that he invented is still in use

00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:49.105
not only in the US,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.613
but, 230 years later,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.980
in places like Canada,

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.824
India,

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:56.371
South Africa,

00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:57.993
Brazil.

00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:00.897
So in an extraordinary range
of contexts all over the world,

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:03.001
this technology is still the dominant,

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:06.284
most used, most effective technology
to manage governance.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:09.937
In that moment,

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.533
Madison believed that,
having solved this problem,

00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:15.172
the country would run smoothly,

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.004
and that he had designed a technology

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:20.074
that would minimize
the results of factions

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.270
so there would be no political parties.

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:24.803
Remarkably, he thought
he had designed a constitution

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:26.526
that was against political parties

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.476
and would make them unnecessary.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.406
He had gotten an enormous degree of help

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.273
in the final marketing phase
of his constitutional project

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.365
from a man you may have heard of,
called Alexander Hamilton.

00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:41.751
Now, Hamilton was everything
Madison was not.

00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:46.705
He was passionate,
where Madison was restrained.

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.577
He was pansexual,

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:51.441
where Madison didn't speak
to a woman except for once

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.055
until he was 42 years old,

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.438
and then married Dolley
and lived happily ever after for 40 years.

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.359
(Laughter)

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.543
To put it bluntly,

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:00.974
Hamilton's the kind of person

00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:03.227
about whom you would write
a hip-hop musical --

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.278
(Laughter)

00:04:04.302 --> 00:04:05.890
and Madison is the kind of person

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:08.319
about whom you would not write
a hip-hop musical.

00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:09.363
(Laughter)

00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:11.387
Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all.

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:13.541
But together,

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.637
they had become a rather unlikely pairing,

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:17.710
and they had produced
the Federalist Papers,

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:19.806
which offered a justification

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.995
and, as I mentioned,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.255
a marketing plan for the Constitution,

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:27.008
which had been wildly effective
and wildly successful.

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.299
Once the new government was in place,

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:32.470
Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,

00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:35.184
and he had a very specific idea in mind.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.361
And that was

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:39.356
to do for financial institutions
and infrastructure

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.845
exactly what Madison had done
for constitutions.

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:45.844
Again, his contemporaries all knew it.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.702
One of them told Madison,

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.479
who can't have liked it very much,

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:52.647
that Hamilton was the Newton
of infrastructure.

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.551
The idea was pretty straightforward.

00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:58.276
Hamilton would give
the United States a national bank,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.376
a permanent national debt --

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.608
he said it would be
"immortal," his phrase --

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:11.246
and a manufacturing policy
that would enable trade and manufacturing

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.828
rather than agriculture,

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:16.688
which was where the country's primary
wealth had historically been.

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:19.782
Madison went utterly ballistic.

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:23.635
And in this pivotal, critical decision,

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.906
instead of just telling the world
that his old friend Hamilton was wrong

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.629
and was adopting the wrong policies,

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:32.415
he actually began to argue

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.540
that Hamilton's ideas
were unconstitutional --

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:38.534
that they violated the very nature
of the Constitution

00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:40.783
that the two of them had drafted together.

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:45.360
Hamilton responded
the way you would expect.

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:51.255
He declared Madison to be
his "personal and political enemy" --

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.824
these are his words.

00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:56.807
So these two founders who had been
such close friends and such close allies

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.073
and such partners,

00:05:58.097 --> 00:06:01.043
then began to produce enmity.

00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:04.030
And they did it in the good,
old-fashioned way.

00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:05.900
First, they founded political parties.

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:09.508
Madison created a party originally called
the Democratic Republican Party --

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:10.742
"Republican" for short --

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:13.601
and Hamilton created a party
called the Federalist Party.

00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:18.140
Those two parties adopted
positions on national politics

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.881
that were extreme and exaggerated.

00:06:20.905 --> 00:06:22.639
To give you a clear example:

00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:24.211
Madison, who had always believed

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:27.324
that the country would have
some manufacturing and some trade

00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:28.918
and some agriculture,

00:06:28.942 --> 00:06:31.150
began attacking Hamilton

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:34.548
as a kind of tool of the financial markets

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:40.235
whom Hamilton himself intended
to put in charge of the country.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.000
That was an overstatement,

00:06:42.024 --> 00:06:44.144
but it was something
Madison came to believe.

00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:46.037
He also attacked city life,

00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:48.866
and he said that the coasts were corrupt,

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.521
and what people needed to do
was to look inwards

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.258
to the center of the country,

00:06:53.282 --> 00:06:57.095
to farmers, who were the essence
of Republican virtue,

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.451
and they should go back to the values
that had made American great,

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:03.813
specifically the values of the Revolution,

00:07:03.837 --> 00:07:06.338
and those were the values of low taxes,

00:07:06.362 --> 00:07:07.523
agriculture

00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:08.807
and less trade.

00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:14.088
Hamilton responded to this
by saying that Madison was naïve,

00:07:14.112 --> 00:07:16.256
that he was childish,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.721
and that his goal was
to turn the United States

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:20.540
into a primitive autarchy,

00:07:20.564 --> 00:07:24.399
self-reliant and completely ineffectual
on the global scale.

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:25.934
(Laughter)

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.663
They both meant it,

00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:30.042
and there was some truth
to each of their claims,

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:34.408
because each side was grossly exaggerating
the views of the other

00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:36.278
in order to fight their war.

00:07:36.902 --> 00:07:39.035
They founded newspapers,

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.004
and so for the first time in US history,

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:45.988
the news that people received
came entirely through the lens

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:48.642
of either the Republican
or the Federalist party.

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:52.463
How does this end?

00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:57.485
Well, as it turned out,
the Constitution did its work.

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:00.999
But it did its work in surprising ways

00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:05.126
that Madison himself
had not fully anticipated.

00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:08.738
First, there was a series of elections.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.829
And the first two times out of the box,

00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:15.694
the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.090
Madison was astonished.

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:21.658
Of course, he blamed the press.

00:08:21.682 --> 00:08:24.020
(Laughter)

00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:26.343
And in a rather innovative view --

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.553
Madison never failed to innovate
when he thought about anything --

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:32.242
he said the reason
that the press was so pro-Federalist

00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:35.641
is that the advertisers
were all Federalists,

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:40.392
because they were traders on the coasts
who got their capital from Britain,

00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:42.379
which Federalism was in bed with.

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:45.454
That was his initial explanation.

00:08:46.232 --> 00:08:48.280
But despite the fact that the Federalists,

00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:49.455
once in power,

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:54.704
actually enacted laws that criminalized
criticism of the government --

00:08:54.728 --> 00:08:56.601
that happened in the United States --

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.511
nevertheless,

00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:01.222
the Republicans fought back,

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:04.549
and Madison began to emphasize
the freedom of speech,

00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:07.061
which he had built
into the Bill of Rights,

00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:09.220
and the capacity of civil society

00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:10.610
to organize.

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:13.256
And sure enough, nationally,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.643
small local groups -- they were called
Democratic-Republican Societies --

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:22.312
began to form and protest
against Federalist-dominated hegemony.

00:09:23.136 --> 00:09:28.373
Eventually, the Republicans managed
to win a national election --

00:09:28.397 --> 00:09:29.856
that was in 1800.

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.805
Madison became the Secretary of State,

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:35.519
his friend and mentor Jefferson
became president,

00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:37.765
and they actually, over time,

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:42.244
managed to put the Federalists
completely out of business.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:43.951
That was their goal.

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:47.779
Now, why did that happen?

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:52.489
It happened because in the structure
of the Constitution

00:09:52.513 --> 00:09:56.273
were several features
that actually managed faction

00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:58.827
the way there were supposed to do
in the first place.

00:09:58.851 --> 00:10:00.106
What were those?

00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:02.791
One -- most important of all --

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:04.629
the freedom of speech.

00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:06.810
This was an innovative idea at the time.

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:09.093
Namely, that if you were out of power,

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:11.875
you could still say
that the government was terrible.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.120
Two,

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.652
civil society organization.

00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:21.165
The capacity to put together
private groups, individuals,

00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:22.796
political parties and others

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.953
who would organize to try to bring
about fundamental change.

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:32.130
Perhaps most significantly
was the separation of powers --

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:34.633
an extraordinary component
of the Constitution.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:37.087
The thing about the separation of powers

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.585
is that it did then and it does now,

00:10:39.609 --> 00:10:43.118
drive governance to the center.

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.438
You can get elected to office
in the United States

00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:49.430
with help from the periphery,

00:10:49.454 --> 00:10:50.734
right or left.

00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:52.736
It turns out,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.099
you actually can't govern
unless you bring on board the center.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.698
There are midterm elections
that come incredibly fast

00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:04.651
after a presidency begins.

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.260
Those drive presidents towards the center.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:13.473
There's a structure in which
the president, in fact, does not rule

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:14.908
or even govern,

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:18.977
but can only propose laws
which other people have to agree with --

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:22.154
another feature that tends
to drive presidents

00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:23.936
who actually want to get things done

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.150
to the center.

00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:29.785
And a glance at the newspapers today
will reveal to you

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:33.601
that these principles are still
completely in operation.

00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:36.481
No matter how a president gets elected,

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:39.283
the president cannot get anything done

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:43.691
unless the president first of all
follows the rules of the Constitution,

00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:44.871
because if not,

00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:48.192
the courts will stand up,
as indeed has sometimes occurred,

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:51.076
not only recently,
but in the past, in US history.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.253
And furthermore,

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:53.847
the president needs people,

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:56.943
elected officials who know
they need to win election

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.412
from centrist voters,

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:02.661
also to back his or her policies
in order to pass laws.

00:12:03.562 --> 00:12:06.137
Without it, nothing much happens.

00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:11.437
The takeaway of this brief excursus

00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:15.611
into the history of partisanship,
then, is the following:

00:12:17.498 --> 00:12:19.143
partisanship is real;

00:12:20.048 --> 00:12:21.462
it's profound;

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:24.441
it's extraordinarily powerful,

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:26.255
and it's terribly upsetting.

00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:33.182
But the design of the Constitution
is greater than partisanship.

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:38.711
It enables us to manage partisanship
when that's possible,

00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:44.711
and it enables us actually
to overcome partisan division

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:46.383
and produce compromise,

00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:48.652
when and only when that is possible.

00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:54.585
A technology like that
is a technology that worked

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:56.326
for the founders,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.791
it worked for their grandchildren,

00:13:00.084 --> 00:13:02.292
it didn't work at the moment
of the Civil War,

00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:04.230
but then it started working again.

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:06.966
And it worked for our grandparents,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.544
our parents,

00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:11.986
and it's going to work for us.

00:13:13.468 --> 00:13:17.924
(Applause)

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:20.827
So what you should do is really simple.

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:23.502
Stand up for what you believe in,

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.593
support the organizations
that you care about,

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:30.454
speak out on the issues
that matter to you,

00:13:31.425 --> 00:13:33.256
get involved,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.795
make change,

00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:36.714
express you opinion,

00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:40.589
and do it with respect
and knowledge and confidence

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:43.467
that it's only by working together

00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:48.062
that the constitutional technology
can do the job that it is designed to do.

00:13:48.997 --> 00:13:50.690
Stand up for what you believe,

00:13:50.714 --> 00:13:52.813
but take a deep breath while you do it.

00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:56.413
It's going to be OK.

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:58.426
Thanks.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.104
(Applause)
