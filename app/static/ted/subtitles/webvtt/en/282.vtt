00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I had a fire nine days ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My archive:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd collected --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was a collector, major, big-time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's gone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I just looked at it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I didn't know what to do.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I mean, this was --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was I my things?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I always live in the present -- I love the present.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I cherish the future.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You've got to make something good out of something bad.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This was bad! Man, I was --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I cough. I was sick.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's my camera lens. The first one --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's my feature film. "King, Murray"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the only print I had.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's my papers.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which opens in New York in two weeks

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
downtown.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That's me at my desk.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know -- all the stuff.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That's my daughter, Jean.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's my sister. She took care of pictures,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that I believed said a lot.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And those are some of the pictures that --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
something was good about the burnt pictures.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I didn't know. I looked at that --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I said, "Wow, is that better than the --"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Idea about women.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You could cry about this." I really didn't.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I just instead said,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And I appreciate this moment

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to come up on this stage with so many people

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who've already given me so much solace,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and just say to TEDsters:

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
all these pieces.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I was a big record collector --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
film burns. Film burns.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The negatives are gone.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's my father's letter to me, telling me to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That's my daughter and me.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's my house.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's my wife, Heidi,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
who didn't take it as well as I did.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
My children, Davey and Henry.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, my message to you folks,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I came to live it, and I am living it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
just 35 miles from here.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Thank you everybody.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Applause)
