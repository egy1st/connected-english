WEBVTT

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.760
I'd like to introduce you to my mom.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.896
(Laughter)

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.016
I'm guessing that's not what you expected,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.016
and it's not what I expected either,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.496
and thank goodness I realized
that an Asian man was not my mom

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.616
before I hugged him,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.360
because that would have been so awkward.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.856
Recognizing people
isn't one of my strengths

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.735
due to a genetic visual impairment
that has no correction or cure.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.696
As a result, I am legally blind,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.416
though I prefer "partially sighted"
because it's more optimistic.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.056
(Laughter)

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.920
And I'm entitled to the label "disabled."

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.000
I hate the word disabled
when it's used to describe people.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.560
It detonates a mindset of less than

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.256
that utterly disregards capacity,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.120
ability, potential,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.040
instead prioritizing brokenness

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
and lack.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.760
The perspective can be overt.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.440
What can't he do for himself
that I'm going to have to do for him?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.736
She'll probably need some accommodation

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.400
that no other employee
at this business needs.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200
Sometimes, the hidden bias

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.840
is so sweetly conveyed.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.240
"Wow, Susan,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.680
look at everything you've done
in your career and your life.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.856
How did you do all of that
and be visually impaired?"

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.456
(Laughter)

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.296
I fail at being disabled.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.696
(Laughter)

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.056
So in the spirit of incentivizing
the rampant failure

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.376
of people all over the world

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.936
and enticing the so-called normal
to just give it a rest already,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.896
here are five tips

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.960
to fail at being disabled.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.536
Tip one:

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.039
know your superpowers.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.416
The best team I ever led in my career

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.456
was based on superpowers,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.136
and we even gave ourselves
fancy-pantsy titles

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.240
like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen."

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.456
"The Biscuit Butterer."

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.096
(Laughter)

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.360
"The Voice of Reason."

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.136
Because we relied on our strengths,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.416
our best strengths,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.640
we achieved tremendous outcomes.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.936
The trait that prevents me
from recognizing my mom

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.816
allows me to smoothly adapt,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.656
to quickly absorb and accurately process
an exhausting volume of cues,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.576
tease out what's important,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.656
determine multiple processes or potentials
for any situation that I'm in,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.640
and then select the one
that makes the most sense,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.160
all in a matter of seconds.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.240
I see what other people do not.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.850
Some people think that's a superpower,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.320
but my real superpowers

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.416
are ricocheting off of glass walls --

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.936
(Laughter)

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.096
and letting my friends
walk around with kale in their teeth.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.416
(Laughter)

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.960
It's true. Don't have lunch with me,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.520
or dinner.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.736
Tip two: be supremely skilled,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.200
supremely skilled at getting it wrong.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.256
It is important to be
as equally confident in your superpowers

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.560
as you are in you FUBARs.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.176
That's "effed up beyond all recognition"

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.416
for you millennials.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.896
(Laughter)

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
Here's a good example.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.136
It is not a great idea to say,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.920
"Don't worry, everything in here
is too small for me to see"

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.736
when you accidentally
walk into the men's room --

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.656
(Laughter)

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.976
at one of the world's
largest sporting arenas --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.736
(Laughter)

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.856
or anywhere.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000
I really wish that one wasn't true.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.176
I'm serious. It is better to just walk out
and let them think you're drunk.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.096
(Laughter)

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.160
Tip three: know that everyone
is disabled in some way,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.376
like when you have a cold
and you can't smell

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.776
and you realize that the milk
that you splashed in your coffee was sour

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.760
only after you've tasted it.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.296
Very recently, a woman
walked up to me frantic.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.000
She could not find
the bakery she was looking for.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.496
As I motioned in the direction
I thought she should go,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.456
saying, "There are no stores
on this side of the street

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.496
so your best bet is to cross --"

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.896
"Oh my goodness," she interrupted.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.736
"There it is.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.656
All I needed was another set of eyes."

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.016
(Laughter)

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.320
I just let her have it.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.096
I would have said that, you know,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.816
being logical and paying attention

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.776
and staying calm
would have done the trick,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.000
but who am I?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.000
Tip four: point out
the disability in others.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.496
This one is best reserved --
very important note --

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.216
this one is best reserved
for people you know well,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.800
because random strangers
typically don't appreciate

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.920
teachable moments.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.496
A few years ago, my parents and I
went to see the Rockettes,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400
Radio City's high-kicking dancers.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.600
I leaned over to my dad.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.440
"The two Rockettes on the left
aren't kicking in a straight line."

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.000
"Yes, they are."

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.000
"No, they're not."

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.856
"Yes, they are, and how do you know?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.080
You can't see."

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.840
But I know what
a straight line looks like.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.536
I had snapped a picture
during our back and forth

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.800
and presented him the evidence
that proved I was right.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.080
He looked at the picture.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.160
I leaned in further.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.080
"Who's disabled now?"

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.840
Tip five: pursue audacious goals.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.936
Flip expectation upside down

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.080
and shove limitation off a cliff
to meet its demise.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.936
There is a college football linebacker

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.216
who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.600
while having one hand.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.616
There is a teacher
who successfully transfers knowledge

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.840
and inspires countless students

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.360
while living with Down syndrome.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.480
And for me,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.136
on my long list,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.016
to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal,
to Darjeeling, India

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.400
on the backseat
of a bicycle built for two.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.616
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.296
and I'm sure I will have
the blurry photos to show for it.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.136
(Laughter)

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.456
Oh, before we go on,
I forgot to introduce you to my mom.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.680
I need to do that.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.736
And here she is,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.816
as she would appear to me

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.680
if I were looking through a crowd
of people looking for her.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.360
Or is that an Asian man?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.056
Thank you.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.280
(Applause)
