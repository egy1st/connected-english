WEBVTT

00:00:01.753 --> 00:00:02.920
Cancer.

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:06.366
Many of us have lost family,
friends or loved ones

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.070
to this horrible disease.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:10.190
I know there are some of you
in the audience

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:11.455
who are cancer survivors,

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.634
or who are fighting cancer at this moment.

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:15.649
My heart goes out to you.

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:20.947
While this word often conjures up
emotions of sadness and anger and fear,

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.485
I bring you good news
from the front lines of cancer research.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.369
The fact is, we are starting to win
the war on cancer.

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.021
In fact, we lie at the intersection

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:35.234
of the three of the most exciting
developments within cancer research.

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.543
The first is cancer genomics.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.592
The genome is a composition

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:42.552
of all the genetic information
encoded by DNA

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:43.943
in an organism.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.808
In cancers, changes
in the DNA called mutations

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.634
are what drive these cancers
to go out of control.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.362
Around 10 years ago,
I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.984
that first mapped
the mutations of cancers.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.194
We did this first for colorectal,

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:00.744
breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:04.676
And since then, there have been
over 90 projects in 70 countries

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.290
all over the world,

00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:09.689
working to understand
the genetic basis of these diseases.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.767
Today, tens of thousands
of cancers are understood

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:15.086
down to exquisite molecular detail.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.502
The second revolution
is precision medicine,

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.930
also known as "personalized medicine."

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:24.531
Instead of one-size-fits-all methods
to be able to treat cancers,

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.210
there is a whole new class of drugs
that are able to target cancers

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.441
based on their unique genetic profile.

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:33.847
Today, there are a host
of these tailor-made drugs,

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.201
called targeted therapies,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:37.408
available to physicians even today

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.695
to be able to personalize
their therapy for their patients,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.645
and many others are in development.

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:46.594
The third exciting revolution
is immunotherapy,

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:48.394
and this is really exciting.

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:51.755
Scientists have been able
to leverage the immune system

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.274
in the fight against cancer.

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:58.028
For example, there have been ways
where we find the off switches of cancer,

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:01.496
and new drugs have been able
to turn the immune system back on,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.108
to be able to fight cancer.

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:07.223
In addition, there are ways
where you can take away immune cells

00:02:07.247 --> 00:02:08.407
from the body,

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.518
train them, engineer them
and put them back into the body

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:12.919
to fight cancer.

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.621
Almost sounds like
science fiction, doesn't it?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.106
While I was a researcher
at the National Cancer Institute,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.585
I had the privilege of working
with some of the pioneers of this field

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.855
and watched the development firsthand.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.322
It's been pretty amazing.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.351
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:33.560
actively recruiting patients
to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:37.725
While these three exciting
revolutions are ongoing,

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.773
unfortunately, this is only the beginning,

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:43.008
and there are still many, many challenges.

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:44.781
Let me illustrate with a patient.

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.112
Here is a patient
with a skin cancer called melanoma.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.183
It's horrible; the cancer
has gone everywhere.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.926
However, scientists were able
to map the mutations of this cancer

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.006
and give a specific treatment
that targets one of the mutations.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.403
And the result is almost miraculous.

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:06.873
Tumors almost seem to melt away.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.422
Unfortunately, this is not
the end of the story.

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:13.556
A few months later, this picture is taken.

00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:15.644
The tumor has come back.

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:18.207
The question is: Why?

00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:21.324
The answer is tumor heterogeneity.

00:03:22.107 --> 00:03:23.356
Let me explain.

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:28.612
Even a cancer as small
as one centimeter in diameter

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:31.329
harbors over a hundred million
different cells.

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:33.729
While genetically similar,

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:36.462
there are small differences
in these different cancers

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:39.343
that make them differently prone
to different drugs.

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.795
So even if you have a drug
that's highly effective,

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.554
that kills almost all the cells,

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:46.768
there is a chance
that there's a small population

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.566
that's resistant to the drug.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.612
This ultimately is the population

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:51.800
that comes back,

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:53.142
and takes over the patient.

00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:56.746
So then the question is:
What do we do with this information?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.032
Well, the key, then,

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:02.926
is to apply all these exciting
advancements in cancer therapy earlier,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.172
as soon as we can,

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.535
before these resistance clones emerge.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.589
The key to cancer and curing cancer
is early detection.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.108
And we intuitively know this.

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:17.218
Finding cancer early
results in better outcomes,

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:19.288
and the numbers show this as well.

00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:23.555
For example, in ovarian cancer,
if you detect cancer in stage four,

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.708
only 17 percent of the women
survive at five years.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:31.696
However, if you are able to detect
this cancer as early as stage one,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.412
over 92 percent of women will survive.

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.728
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent
of women are detected at stage one,

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:45.324
whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,
are detected in stages three and four.

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:49.529
We desperately need
better detection mechanisms for cancers.

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:54.331
The current best ways to screen cancer
fall into one of three categories.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.530
First is medical procedures,

00:04:56.554 --> 00:04:59.462
which is like colonoscopy
for colon cancer.

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:04.102
Second is protein biomarkers,
like PSA for prostate cancer.

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:07.038
Or third, imaging techniques,

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:09.425
such as mammography for breast cancer.

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.845
Medical procedures are the gold standard;

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:14.965
however, they are highly invasive

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:17.794
and require a large
infrastructure to implement.

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:21.886
Protein markers, while effective
in some populations,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.399
are not very specific
in some circumstances,

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:27.006
resulting in high numbers
of false positives,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.235
which then results in unnecessary work-ups
and unnecessary procedures.

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:36.286
Imaging methods,
while useful in some populations,

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.858
expose patients to harmful radiation.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.496
In addition, it is not applicable
to all patients.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.563
For example, mammography has problems
in women with dense breasts.

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.430
So what we need is a method
that is noninvasive,

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:52.221
that is light in infrastructure,

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:53.508
that is highly specific,

00:05:54.148 --> 00:05:57.369
that also does not have false positives,

00:05:57.393 --> 00:05:59.359
does not use any radiation

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:02.314
and is applicable to large populations.

00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:03.512
Even more importantly,

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.732
we need a method
to be able to detect cancers

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:08.448
before they're 100 million cells in size.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.625
Does such a technology exist?

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.929
Well, I wouldn't be up here
giving a talk if it didn't.

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:18.373
I'm excited to tell you about
this latest technology we've developed.

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:21.917
Central to our technology
is a simple blood test.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:26.112
The blood circulatory system,
while seemingly mundane,

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.466
is essential for you to survive,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.995
providing oxygen
and nutrients to your cells,

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:33.624
and removing waste and carbon dioxide.

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.501
Here's a key biological insight:

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.503
Cancer cells grow and die
faster than normal cells,

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:40.723
and when they die,

00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:43.468
DNA is shed into the blood system.

00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:46.262
Since we know the signatures
of these cancer cells

00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.990
from all the different cancer
genome sequencing projects,

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.055
we can look for those signals in the blood

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.251
to be able to detect these cancers early.

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.208
So instead of waiting for cancers
to be large enough to cause symptoms,

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:01.131
or for them to be dense enough
to show up on imaging,

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.597
or for them to be prominent enough

00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.861
for you to be able to visualize
on medical procedures,

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:10.877
we can start looking for cancers
while they are relatively pretty small,

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:14.505
by looking for these small amounts
of DNA in the blood.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:17.490
So let me tell you how we do this.

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:20.378
First, like I said, we start off
with a simple blood test --

00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:22.977
no radiation, no complicated equipment --

00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.467
a simple blood test.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.027
Then the blood is shipped to us,

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:28.440
and what we do
is extract the DNA out of it.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.506
While your body is mostly healthy cells,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.176
most of the DNA that's detected
will be from healthy cells.

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:38.901
However, there will be a small amount,
less than one percent,

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.657
that comes from the cancer cells.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:45.751
Then we use molecular biology methods
to be able to enrich this DNA

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:50.187
for areas of the genome which are known
to be associated with cancer,

00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.164
based on the information
from the cancer genomics projects.

00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:57.541
We're able to then put this DNA
into DNA-sequencing machines

00:07:57.565 --> 00:08:02.255
and are able to digitize the DNA
into A's, C's, T's and G's

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.877
and have this final readout.

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:10.441
Ultimately, we have information
of billions of letters

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.475
that output from this run.

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:17.855
We then apply statistical
and computational methods

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:20.551
to be able to find
the small signal that's present,

00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:24.231
indicative of the small amount
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.703
So does this actually work in patients?

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:31.217
Well, because there's no way
of really predicting right now

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.749
which patients will get cancer,

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.830
we use the next best population:

00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:36.876
cancers in remission;

00:08:37.552 --> 00:08:39.974
specifically, lung cancer.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:43.714
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs
that we have today,

00:08:43.738 --> 00:08:45.950
most lung cancers come back.

00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:47.274
The key, then, is to see

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:50.949
whether we're able to detect
these recurrences of cancers

00:08:50.973 --> 00:08:52.840
earlier than with standard methods.

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:55.716
We just finished a major trial

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.487
with Professor Charles Swanton
at University College London,

00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:00.677
examining this.

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:03.219
Let me walk you through
an example of one patient.

00:09:04.766 --> 00:09:07.593
Here's an example of one patient
who undergoes surgery

00:09:07.617 --> 00:09:08.785
at time point zero,

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:11.291
and then undergoes chemotherapy.

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.194
Then the patient is under remission.

00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:18.827
He is monitored using clinical exams
and imaging methods.

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:24.052
Around day 450, unfortunately,
the cancer comes back.

00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:27.751
The question is:
Are we able to catch this earlier?

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:31.520
During this whole time,
we've been collecting blood serially

00:09:31.544 --> 00:09:34.822
to be able to measure
the amount of ctDNA in the blood.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.857
So at the initial time point, as expected,

00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:42.579
there's a high level
of cancer DNA in the blood.

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:46.270
However, this goes away to zero
in subsequent time points

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.751
and remains negligible
after subsequent points.

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:56.266
However, around day 340, we see the rise
of cancer DNA in the blood,

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.855
and eventually, it goes up higher
for days 400 and 450.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:03.847
Here's the key, if you've missed it:

00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:08.852
At day 340, we see the rise
in the cancer DNA in the blood.

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:13.092
That means we are catching this cancer
over a hundred days earlier

00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:14.593
than traditional methods.

00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:17.914
This is a hundred days earlier
where we can give therapies,

00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:21.257
a hundred days earlier
where we can do surgical interventions,

00:10:21.281 --> 00:10:24.314
or even a hundred days less
for the cancer to grow

00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:27.460
or a hundred days less
for resistance to occur.

00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:32.857
For some patients, this hundred days
means the matter of life and death.

00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.740
We're really excited
about this information.

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:39.636
Because of this assignment,
we've done additional studies now

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.922
in other cancers,

00:10:40.946 --> 00:10:44.281
including breast cancer, lung cancer

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:45.526
and ovarian cancer,

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:50.418
and I can't wait to see how much earlier
we can find these cancers.

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:53.822
Ultimately, I have a dream,

00:10:54.394 --> 00:10:56.660
a dream of two vials of blood,

00:10:57.536 --> 00:11:01.401
and that, in the future, as part of all
of our standard physical exams,

00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:03.353
we'll have two vials of blood drawn.

00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.163
And from these two vials of blood
we will be able to compare

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:10.698
the DNA from all known
signatures of cancer,

00:11:10.722 --> 00:11:14.669
and hopefully then detect cancers
months to even years earlier.

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:17.530
Even with the therapies we have currently,

00:11:17.554 --> 00:11:20.155
this could mean that millions
of lives could be saved.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:24.350
And if you add on to that
recent advancements in immunotherapy

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:25.666
and targeted therapies,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.862
the end of cancer is in sight.

00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:31.091
The next time you hear the word "cancer,"

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:33.541
I want you to add to the emotions: hope.

00:11:34.303 --> 00:11:35.461
Hold on.

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:39.915
Cancer researchers all around the world
are working feverishly

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:41.095
to beat this disease,

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:43.149
and tremendous progress is being made.

00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:45.924
This is the beginning of the end.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.509
We will win the war on cancer.

00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:50.725
And to me, this is amazing news.

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:52.360
Thank you.

00:11:52.384 --> 00:11:56.905
(Applause)
