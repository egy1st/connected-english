00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.040
Here's a question for you:

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.576
how many different scents
do you think you can smell,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.520
and maybe even identify with accuracy?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.000
100?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
300?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.280
1,000?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.256
One study estimates that humans can
detect up to one trillion different odors.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.896
A trillion.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.736
It's hard to imagine,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
but your nose has the molecular
machinery to make it happen.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.736
Olfactory receptors --

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.696
tiny scent detectors --

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.656
are packed into your nose,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.096
each one patiently waiting
to be activated by the odor,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.416
or ligand,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.280
that it's been assigned to detect.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.616
It turns out we humans,
like all vertebrates,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.240
have lots of olfactory receptors.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.536
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted
to genes for different olfactory receptors

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.880
than for any other type of protein.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.519
Why is that?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.936
Could olfactory receptors
be doing something else

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.160
in addition to allowing us to smell?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.896
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel
uncovered the molecular identity

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.416
of olfactory receptors --

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.600
work which ultimately
led to a Nobel Prize.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.776
At the time,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.600
we all assumed that these receptors
were only found in the nose.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.696
However, about a year or so later,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.216
a report emerged of an olfactory
receptor expressed in a tissue

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.336
other than the nose.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.016
And then another such report emerged,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.240
and another.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.936
We now know that these receptors
are found all over the body,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320
including in some pretty
unexpected places --

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.536
in muscle,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.136
in kidneys,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.696
lungs

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.496
and blood vessels.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.680
But what are they doing there?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.455
Well, we know that olfactory receptors
act as sensitive chemical sensors

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.696
in the nose --

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.760
that's how they mediate
our sense of smell.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.656
It turns out they also act
as sensitive chemical sensors

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360
in many other parts of the body.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.176
Now, I'm not saying that your liver can
detect the aroma of your morning coffee

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.581
as you walk into the kitchen.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.616
Rather, after you drink
your morning coffee,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.616
your liver might use an olfactory receptor

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.816
to chemically detect
the change in concentration

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.079
of a chemical floating
through your bloodstream.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.496
Many cell types and tissues in the body
use chemical sensors,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.016
or chemosensors,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.016
to keep track of the concentration
of hormones, metabolites

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.496
and other molecules,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.320
and some of these chemosensors
are olfactory receptors.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.176
If you are a pancreas or a kidney

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.016
and you need a specialized chemical sensor

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.616
that will allow you to keep track
of a specific molecule,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.240
why reinvent the wheel?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.376
One of the first examples

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.336
of an olfactory receptor
found outside the nose

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.640
showed that human sperm
express an olfactory receptor,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.696
and that sperm with this receptor
will seek out the chemical

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.656
that the receptor responds to --

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.336
the receptor's ligand.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.760
That is, the sperm
will swim toward the ligand.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.720
This has intriguing implications.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.456
Are sperm aided in finding the egg

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.120
by sniffing out the area
with the highest ligand concentration?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.936
I like this example
because it clearly demonstrates

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.256
that an olfactory receptor's primary job
is to be a chemical sensor,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.176
but depending on the context,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.896
it can influence how you perceive a smell,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.520
or in which direction sperm will swim,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.896
and as it turns out,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.240
a huge variety of other processes.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.936
Olfactory receptors have been
implicated in muscle cell migration,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.976
in helping the lung to sense
and respond to inhaled chemicals,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.560
and in wound healing.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.016
Similarly, taste receptors once thought
to be found only in the tongue,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.040
are now known to be expressed
in cells and tissues throughout the body.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.336
Even more surprisingly,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.856
a recent study found

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.440
that the light receptors in our eyes
also play a role in our blood vessels.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.056
In my lab,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.536
we work on trying to understand the roles
of olfactory receptors and taste receptors

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.840
in the context of the kidney.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.856
The kidney is a central
control center for homeostasis.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.096
And to us,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.896
it makes sense that a homeostatic
control center would be a logical place

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.960
to employ chemical sensors.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.176
We've identified a number
of different olfactory and taste receptors

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.536
in the kidney,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.136
one of which, olfactory receptor 78,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.536
is known to be expressed
in cells and tissues

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.560
that are important
in the regulation of blood pressure.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.536
When this receptor is deleted in mice,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.640
their blood pressure is low.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.896
Surprisingly, this receptor
was found to respond

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.136
to chemicals called
short-chain fatty acids

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.976
that are produced by the bacteria
that reside in your gut --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.520
your gut microbiota.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.536
After being produced
by your gut microbiota,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.376
these chemicals are absorbed
into your bloodstream

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.496
where they can then
interact with receptors

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.536
like olfactory receptor 78,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.416
meaning that the changes
in metabolism of your gut microbiota

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.000
may influence your blood pressure.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.136
Although we've identified a number
of different olfactory and taste receptors

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.416
in the kidney,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.576
we've only just begun
to tease out their different functions

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.040
and to figure out which chemicals
each of them responds to.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.176
Similar investigations lie ahead
for many other organs and tissues --

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.960
only a small minority of receptors
has been studied to date.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.160
This is exciting stuff.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.616
It's revolutionizing our understanding
of the scope of influence

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.560
for one of the five senses.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.256
And it has the potential
to change our understanding

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.920
of some aspects of human physiology.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.776
It's still early,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.056
but I think we've picked up on the scent
of something we're following.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.096
(Laughter)

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.336
Thank you.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.800
(Applause)
