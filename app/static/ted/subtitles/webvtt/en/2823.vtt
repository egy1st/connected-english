00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.350
The first time I cried underwater

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:04.917
was in 2008,

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:06.518
the island of Curaçao,

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.424
way down in the southern Caribbean.

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.500
It's beautiful there.

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:13.450
I was studying these corals for my PhD,

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.856
and after days and days
of diving on the same reef,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.909
I had gotten to know them as individuals.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.404
I had made friends with coral colonies --

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.182
totally a normal thing to do.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.956
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
and ripped off their skin,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.469
leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing,

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:35.800
and big patches of dead skeleton
that would get overgrown by algae.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.405
When I saw this damage for the first time,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.239
stretching all the way down the reef,

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:42.120
I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:43.540
and I cried.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.921
If a coral could die that fast,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.834
how could a reef ever survive?

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:51.313
And why was I making it my job
to try to fight for them?

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.884
I never heard another scientist
tell that kind of story

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.274
until last year.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:58.808
A scientist in Guam wrote,

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.379
"I cried right into my mask,"

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.613
seeing the damage on the reefs.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.590
Then a scientist in Australia wrote,

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.611
"I showed my students
the results of our coral surveys,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.987
and we wept."

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.544
Crying about corals
is having a moment, guys.

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:14.702
(Laughter)

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.670
And that's because reefs in the Pacific

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:19.528
are losing corals faster
than we've ever seen before.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.141
Because of climate change,

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.974
the water is so hot for so long
in the summers,

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.173
that these animals
can't function normally.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.702
They're spitting out the colored algae
that lives in their skin,

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:34.791
and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:36.069
and then rots away.

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.487
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:42.284
This is happening
over an unbelievable scale.

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:46.444
The Northern Great Barrier Reef
lost two-thirds of its corals last year

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:49.023
over a distance of hundreds of miles,

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:50.849
then bleached again this year,

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:52.991
and the bleaching stretched further south.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.318
Reefs in the Pacific
are in a nosedive right now,

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:58.881
and no one knows
how bad it's going to get,

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.274
except ...

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.237
over in the Caribbean where I work,

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.339
we've already been through the nosedive.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:08.643
Reefs there have suffered
through centuries of intense human abuse.

00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:11.127
We kind of already know
how the story goes.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.289
And we might be able to help predict
what happens next.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:17.529
Let's consult a graph.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:22.003
Since the invention of scuba,

00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:25.008
scientists have measured
the amount of coral on the seafloor,

00:02:25.032 --> 00:02:26.698
and how it's changed through time.

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:29.857
And after centuries
of ratcheting human pressure,

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.482
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.200
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:40.689
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,

00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:43.706
but kind of ended up in the same place.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.667
OK, so far this is not going very well.

00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:48.507
But some reefs in the Caribbean --

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.424
the ones best protected

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:53.162
and the ones a little
further from humans --

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:56.727
they managed to hold onto their corals.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.890
Give us a challenge.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.745
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.776
The second time I cried underwater

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.210
was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:11.918
It was the calmest day of the year,

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.311
but it's always pretty
sketchy diving there.

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:16.431
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.129
I watched my compass
so we could find our way back out,

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:20.783
and he watched for sharks,

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:23.663
and after 20 minutes of swimming
that felt like an hour,

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.403
we finally dropped down to the reef,

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:26.986
and I was so shocked,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.656
and I was so happy

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.675
that my eyes filled with tears.

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:36.324
There were corals 1,000 years old
lined up one after another.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:41.862
They had survived the entire history
of European colonialism in the Caribbean,

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:44.021
and for centuries before that.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:49.803
I never knew what a coral could do
when it was given a chance to thrive.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.223
The truth is that even
as we lose so many corals,

00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:57.303
even as we go through
this massive coral die-off,

00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:59.178
some reefs will survive.

00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:01.566
Some will be ragged on the edge,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.479
some will be beautiful.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.782
And by protecting shorelines
and giving us food to eat

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:08.555
and supporting tourism,

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.701
they will still be worth
billions and billions of dollars a year.

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:14.814
The best time to protect a reef
was 50 years ago,

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.756
but the second-best time is right now.

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:21.246
Even as we go through bleaching events,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.813
more frequent and in more places,

00:04:23.837 --> 00:04:26.112
some corals will be able to recover.

00:04:26.972 --> 00:04:29.824
We had a bleaching event
in 2010 in the Caribbean

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:33.433
that took off big patches of skin
on boulder corals like these.

00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.965
This coral lost half of its skin.

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:41.216
But if you look at the side
of this coral a few years later,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.588
this coral is actually healthy again.

00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:45.909
It's doing what a healthy coral does.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.031
It's making copies of its polyps,

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.510
it's fighting back the algae

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:51.306
and it's reclaiming its territory.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.540
If a few polyps survive,

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:54.737
a coral can regrow;

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.866
it just needs time and protection
and a reasonable temperature.

00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:01.177
Some corals can regrow in 10 years --

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.924
others take a lot longer.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.599
But the more stresses
we take off them locally --

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:09.617
things like overfishing,
sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.086
dredging, coastal construction --

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.980
the better they can hang on
as we stabilize the climate,

00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.814
and the faster they can regrow.

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.684
And as we go through the long,
tough and necessary process

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:24.313
of stabilizing the climate
of planet Earth,

00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:26.767
some new corals will still be born.

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:29.230
This is what I study in my research.

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.225
We try to understand
how corals make babies,

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.923
and how those babies
find their way to the reef,

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.249
and we invent new methods
to help them survive

00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:39.206
those early, fragile life stages.

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.085
One of my favorite
coral babies of all time

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.119
showed up right after Hurricane Omar.

00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:47.834
It's the same species
I was studying before the storm,

00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.290
but you almost never see
babies of this species --

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:51.529
it's really rare.

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:53.867
This is actually an endangered species.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.895
In this photo, this little baby coral,
this little circle of polyps,

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.343
is a few years old.

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.265
Like its cousins that bleach,

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.125
it's fighting back the algae.

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.074
And like its cousins on the north shore,

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.139
it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.

00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:12.048
What's happening in the world
and in the ocean

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.870
has changed our time horizon.

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:17.676
We can be incredibly pessimistic
on the short term,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.015
and mourn what we lost

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.704
and what we really took for granted.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.958
But we can still be optimistic
on the long term,

00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:27.460
and we can still be ambitious
about what we fight for

00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:30.582
and what we expect from our governments,

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:31.897
from our planet.

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:36.274
Corals have been living on planet Earth
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:38.491
They survived the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:39.780
They're badasses.

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:41.846
(Laughter)

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.409
An individual coral can go through
tremendous trauma and fully recover

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:49.219
if it's given a chance
and it's given protection.

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:53.051
Corals have always
been playing the long game,

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.141
and now so are we.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:56.945
Thanks very much.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.817
(Applause)
