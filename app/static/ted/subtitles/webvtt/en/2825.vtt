WEBVTT

00:00:07.265 --> 00:00:09.065
(Laughter)

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:13.653
(Laughter)

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.040
That's SpotMini.

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:27.682
He'll be back in a little while.

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:28.870
I --

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:32.732
(Applause)

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:35.389
I love building robots.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.051
And my long-term goal is to build robots

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:41.157
that can do what people and animals do.

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:45.243
And there's three things in particular

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.424
that we're interested in.

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:51.490
One is balance and dynamic mobility,

00:00:51.514 --> 00:00:54.144
the second one is mobile manipulation,

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:56.533
and the third one is mobile perception.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.035
So, dynamic mobility and balance --

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.696
I'm going to do a demo for you.

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:04.826
I'm standing here, balancing.

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.015
I can see you're not very impressed.
OK, how about now?

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.199
(Laughter)

00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:11.416
How about now?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.483
(Applause)

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.602
Those simple capabilities mean that people
can go almost anywhere on earth,

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.278
on any kind of terrain.

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:22.957
We want to capture that for robots.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:25.344
What about manipulation?

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.510
I'm holding this clicker in my hand;

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:28.826
I'm not even looking at it,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.580
and I can manipulate it
without any problem.

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:34.244
But even more important,

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:39.428
I can move my body while I hold
the manipulator, the clicker,

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.469
and stabilize and coordinate my body,

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:44.015
and I can even walk around.

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:47.445
And that means
I can move around in the world

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.771
and expand the range
of my arms and my hands

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:52.964
and really be able to handle
almost anything.

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.580
So that's mobile manipulation.

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:57.409
And all of you can do this.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.350
Third is perception.

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:02.639
I'm looking at a room
with over 1,000 people in it,

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:07.438
and my amazing visual system
can see every one of you --

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:09.423
you're all stable in space,

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:10.766
even when I move my head,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.336
even when I move around.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.139
That kind of mobile perception
is really important for robots

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:17.807
that are going to move and act

00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:19.044
out in the world.

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.323
I'm going to give you
a little status report

00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:26.193
on where we are in developing robots
toward these ends.

00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:33.058
The first three robots are all
dynamically stabilized robots.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.730
This one goes back
a little over 10 years ago --

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:36.922
"BigDog."

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:40.256
It's got a gyroscope
that helps stabilize it.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.616
It's got sensors and a control computer.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.807
Here's a Cheetah robot
that's running with a galloping gait,

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:48.527
where it recycles its energy,

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.118
it bounces on the ground,

00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:51.696
and it's computing all the time

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.607
in order to keep itself
stabilized and propelled.

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.942
And here's a bigger robot

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:00.671
that's got such good
locomotion using its legs,

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.099
that it can go in deep snow.

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:04.534
This is about 10 inches deep,

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:06.669
and it doesn't really have any trouble.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:10.975
This is Spot, a new generation of robot --

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.807
just slightly older than the one
that came out onstage.

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:16.270
And we've been asking the question --

00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:18.268
you've all heard about drone delivery:

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.915
Can we deliver packages
to your houses with drones?

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.726
Well, what about plain old
legged-robot delivery?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.882
(Laughter)

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:28.303
So we've been taking our robot
to our employees' homes

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:29.910
to see whether we could get in --

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:30.958
(Laughter)

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.210
the various access ways.

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.118
And believe me, in the Boston area,

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:37.316
there's every manner
of stairway twists and turns.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.577
So it's a real challenge.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.418
But we're doing very well,
about 70 percent of the way.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.224
And here's mobile manipulation,

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:46.839
where we've put an arm on the robot,

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:49.197
and it's finding its way through the door.

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:53.081
Now, one of the important things
about making autonomous robots

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:56.325
is to make them not do
just exactly what you say,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.490
but make them deal with the uncertainty
of what happens in the real world.

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:05.245
So we have Steve there,
one of the engineers,

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.877
giving the robot a hard time.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:07.933
(Laughter)

00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:12.147
And the fact that the programming
still tolerates all that disturbance --

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:13.668
it does what it's supposed to.

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.483
Here's another example,
where Eric is tugging on the robot

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:17.805
as it goes up the stairs.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.981
And believe me,

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.277
getting it to do what it's supposed to do
in those circumstances

00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.642
is a real challenge,

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:26.406
but the result is something
that's going to generalize

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.301
and make robots much more autonomous
than they would be otherwise.

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.928
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:38.512
It's a third-generation humanoid
that we've been building.

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:41.669
I'll tell you a little bit
about the hardware design later.

00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:42.869
And we've been saying:

00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:47.316
How close to human levels
of performance and speed could we get

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.915
in an ordinary task,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.408
like moving boxes around on a conveyor?

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:57.417
We're getting up to about two-thirds
of the speed that a human operates

00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:58.603
on average.

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:01.867
And this robot is using both hands,
it's using its body,

00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.060
it's stepping,

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:05.811
so it's really an example
of dynamic stability,

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:07.214
mobile manipulation

00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:08.849
and mobile perception.

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:11.545
Here --

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.992
(Laughter)

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.179
We actually have two Atlases.

00:05:16.663 --> 00:05:17.848
(Laughter)

00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:21.774
Now, everything doesn't go exactly
the way it's supposed to.

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:23.500
(Laughter)

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.026
(Laughter)

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:30.587
(Laughter)

00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:36.016
And here's our latest robot,
called "Handle."

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:40.755
Handle is interesting,
because it's sort of half like an animal,

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.093
and it's half something else

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:45.873
with these leg-like things and wheels.

00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.347
It's got its arms on
in kind of a funny way,

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:51.467
but it really does some remarkable things.

00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.822
It can carry 100 pounds.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:56.905
It's probably going to lift
more than that,

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:58.707
but so far we've done 100.

00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:01.167
It's got some pretty good
rough-terrain capability,

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.619
even though it has wheels.

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.427
And Handle loves to put on a show.

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.224
(Laughter)

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:17.953
(Applause)

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.918
I'm going to give you
a little bit of robot religion.

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:26.865
A lot of people think that a robot
is a machine where there's a computer

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.523
that's telling it what to do,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.896
and the computer is listening
through its sensors.

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.933
But that's really only half of the story.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:38.066
The real story is
that the computer is on one side,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.034
making suggestions to the robot,

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:42.550
and on the other side
are the physics of the world.

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.880
And that physics involves gravity,
friction, bouncing into things.

00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.253
In order to have a successful robot,

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:54.868
my religion is that you have to do
a holistic design,

00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:58.445
where you're designing the software,
the hardware and the behavior

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:59.705
all at one time,

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.431
and all these parts really intermesh
and cooperate with each other.

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:06.562
And when you get the perfect design,
you get a real harmony

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:09.465
between all those parts
interacting with each other.

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.709
So it's half software and half hardware,

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.024
plus the behavior.

00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:18.420
We've done some work lately
on the hardware, where we tried to go --

00:07:18.444 --> 00:07:20.921
the picture on the left
is a conventional design,

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:23.845
where you have parts
that are all bolted together,

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.609
conductors, tubes, connectors.

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:28.682
And on the right
is a more integrated thing;

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:31.107
it's supposed to look like
an anatomy drawing.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.020
Using the miracle of 3-D printing,

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:36.681
we're starting to build parts of robots

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:39.602
that look a lot more
like the anatomy of an animal.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.970
So that's an upper-leg part
that has hydraulic pathways --

00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:44.924
actuators, filters --

00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:47.328
all embedded, all printed as one piece,

00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:50.554
and the whole structure is developed

00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:53.614
with a knowledge of what the loads
and behavior are going to be,

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:56.541
which is available from data
recorded from robots

00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:58.374
and simulations and things like that.

00:07:58.398 --> 00:08:01.335
So it's a data-driven hardware design.

00:08:01.727 --> 00:08:03.453
And using processes like that,

00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:05.721
not only the upper leg
but some other things,

00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:10.885
we've gotten our robots to go from big,
behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:14.528
that one on the right,
weighing almost 400 pounds --

00:08:14.552 --> 00:08:17.661
down to the one in the middle
which was just in the video,

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.248
weighs about 190 pounds,

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:20.969
just a little bit more than me,

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:22.479
and we have a new one,

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.245
which is working but I'm not
going to show it to you yet,

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:26.431
on the left,

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.099
which weighs just 165 pounds,

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:30.389
with all the same
strength and capabilities.

00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:33.143
So these things are really getting
better very quickly.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.722
So it's time for Spot to come back out,

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:41.494
and we're going to demonstrate
a little bit of mobility,

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:43.118
dexterity and perception.

00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:47.625
This is Seth Davis,
who's my robot wrangler today,

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:50.689
and he's giving Spot
some general direction

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.539
by steering it around,

00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:55.634
but all the coordination
of the legs and the sensors

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:58.167
is done by the robot's computers on board.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:02.169
The robot can walk
with a number of different gaits;

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:04.352
it's got a gyro,

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.713
or a solid-state gyro,

00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:07.157
an IMU on board.

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:10.649
Obviously, it's got a battery,
and things like that.

00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:14.038
One of the cool things
about a legged robot is,

00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:15.511
it's omnidirectional.

00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:18.308
In addition to going forward,
it can go sideways,

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.033
it can turn in place.

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.930
And this robot
is a little bit of a show-off.

00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:29.815
It loves to use its dynamic gaits,

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:30.997
like running --

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:32.065
(Laughter)

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:33.605
And it's got one more.

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:37.114
(Laughter)

00:09:38.038 --> 00:09:41.274
Now if it were really a show-off,
it would be hopping on one foot,

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:42.466
but, you know.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.533
Now, Spot has a set of cameras
here, stereo cameras,

00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:48.387
and we have a feed up in the center.

00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:50.595
It's kind of dark out in the audience,

00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:53.839
but it's going to use those cameras
in order to look at the terrain

00:09:53.863 --> 00:09:55.036
right in front of it,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.821
while it goes over
these obstacles back here.

00:09:57.845 --> 00:10:01.158
For this demo, Seth is steering,

00:10:01.182 --> 00:10:03.687
but the robot's doing
all its own terrain planning.

00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:05.213
This is a terrain map,

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:10.407
where the data from the cameras
is being developed in real time,

00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.668
showing the red spots,
which are where it doesn't want to step,

00:10:13.692 --> 00:10:15.683
and the green spots are the good places.

00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.156
And here it's treating
them like stepping-stones.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.935
So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.232
and it adjusts its stride,

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:23.717
and there's a ton of planning

00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:25.982
that has to go into
an operation like that,

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:28.268
and it does all
that planning in real time,

00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:30.722
where it adjusts the steps
a little bit longer

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:32.022
or a little bit shorter.

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:35.826
Now we're going to change it
into a different mode,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.273
where it's just going to treat
the blocks like terrain

00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:43.016
and decide whether to step up or down

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.325
as it goes.

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:48.234
So this is using dynamic balance

00:10:48.258 --> 00:10:50.116
and mobile perception,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.527
because it has to coordinate what it sees
along with how it's moving.

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:01.486
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.

00:11:02.517 --> 00:11:05.007
Some of you may see that
as a head and a neck,

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.616
but believe me, it's an arm.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.405
Seth is driving it around.

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:12.197
He's actually driving the hand
and the body is following.

00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:16.354
So the two are coordinated
in the way I was talking about before --

00:11:16.378 --> 00:11:18.242
in the way people can do that.

00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:22.909
In fact, one of the cool things
Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,"

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:26.117
and it keeps its head
in one place in space,

00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:27.986
and it moves its body all around.

00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:31.335
There's a variation of this
that's called "twerking" --

00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:32.375
(Laughter)

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.222
but we're not going to use that today.

00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:35.317
(Laughter)

00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:38.927
So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
Could you get me a soda?

00:11:39.473 --> 00:11:43.246
For this demo,
Seth is not doing any driving.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.383
We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,

00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:47.944
and it's using these props
we've put on the stage

00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:49.361
to localize itself.

00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:51.666
It's gone over to that location.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.572
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:56.382
to find the cup,

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.288
picks it up --

00:11:58.312 --> 00:12:00.263
and again, Seth's not driving.

00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:04.793
We've planned out a path for it to go --

00:12:04.817 --> 00:12:06.924
it looked like it was
going off the path --

00:12:06.948 --> 00:12:09.306
and now Seth's going
to take over control again,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.779
because I'm a little bit chicken
about having it do this by itself.

00:12:12.803 --> 00:12:14.179
Thank you, Spot.

00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:21.694
(Applause)

00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:24.659
So, Spot:

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:28.250
How do you feel about having just finished
your TED performance?

00:12:29.194 --> 00:12:31.883
(Laughter)

00:12:32.248 --> 00:12:33.400
Me, too!

00:12:33.424 --> 00:12:34.456
(Laughter)

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.296
Thank you all,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.715
and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,

00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:40.853
who did all the hard work behind this.

00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:43.000
(Applause)

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:53.402
Helen Walters: Marc,
come back in the middle.

00:12:53.426 --> 00:12:54.580
Thank you so much.

00:12:54.604 --> 00:12:56.699
Come over here, I have questions.

00:12:56.723 --> 00:13:00.138
So, you mentioned the UPS
and the package delivery.

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:04.099
What are the other applications
that you see for your robots?

00:13:04.123 --> 00:13:06.150
Marc Raibert: You know,
I think that robots

00:13:06.174 --> 00:13:08.580
that have the capabilities
I've been talking about

00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:10.264
are going to be incredibly useful.

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.785
About a year ago, I went to Fukushima

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:14.840
to see what the situation was there,

00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:16.741
and there's just a huge need

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:20.103
for machines that can go
into some of the dirty places

00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:22.095
and help remediate that.

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:27.307
I think it won't be too long until
we have robots like this in our homes,

00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:32.652
and one of the big needs
is to take care of the aging

00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:34.042
and invalids.

00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:38.055
I think that it won't be too long
till we're using robots

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.541
to help take care of our parents,

00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:44.980
or probably more likely,
have our children help take care of us.

00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:47.651
And there's a bunch of other things.

00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:49.041
I think the sky's the limit.

00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.323
Many of the ideas
we haven't thought of yet,

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:54.942
and people like you will help us
think of new applications.

00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:56.553
HW: So what about the dark side?

00:13:56.577 --> 00:13:58.410
What about the military?

00:13:58.434 --> 00:13:59.937
Are they interested?

00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:04.255
MR: Sure, the military has been
a big funder of robotics.

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:08.481
I don't think the military
is the dark side myself,

00:14:08.505 --> 00:14:12.376
but I think, as with all
advanced technology,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.447
it can be used for all kinds of things.

00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:16.112
HW: Awesome. Thank you so much.

00:14:16.136 --> 00:14:17.541
MR: OK, you're welcome.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.717
Thank you.

00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:20.327
(Applause)
