00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:03.286
I love museums.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.016
Have you guys ever been
to the Natural History Museum?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.456
In New York City?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.136
(Applause)

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.856
So one of the things that I do
is I take my kids to the museum.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.456
Recently I took them
to the Natural History Museum.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.600
I had my two sons with me,
Sabian and Dabith.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.256
And we go into the front
entrance of the museum,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.400
and there's that amazing sculpture
of Teddy Roosevelt out there.

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.936
You guys know which one I'm talking about.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.056
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there
with one hand on the horse,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.416
bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.456
I don't know if he's bare-chested,
but it kind of feels like it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.816
(Laughter)

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
And on the left-hand side of him
is a Native American walking.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.440
And on the right-hand side of him
is an African-American walking.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.176
And as we're moving up the stairs,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.136
getting closer to the sculpture,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.216
my oldest son, who's nine, says,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.040
"Dad, how come he gets to ride,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.360
and they have to walk?"

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.880
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.576
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.056
There was so much history

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.736
that we would have to go through
to try to explain that,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
and that's something
I try to do with them anyways.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.696
It's a question that I probably
would have never really asked.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.896
But fundamentally what he was saying was,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.696
"That doesn't look fair.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.240
Dad, that doesn't look fair.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.616
And why is this thing that's so not fair

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.720
sitting outside
of such an amazing institution."

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.296
And his question got me wondering,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.176
is there a way for us
to amend our public sculptures,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.560
our national monuments?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.520
Not erase them,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.892
but is there a way to amend them?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.056
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.416
That's not my history.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.616
My mother was 15 years old
when I was born.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960
She is amazing.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.456
My father was struggling
with his own things

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
for most of my life.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.856
If you really want to know the truth,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.680
the only reason I got into art
is because of a woman.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.816
There was this amazing, amazing,
fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.176
four years older than me,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.016
and I wanted to go out with her.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.536
But she said, "You're too young

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.776
and you're not thinking
about your future."

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.456
So I ran on down to the junior college,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.656
registered for some classes,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.336
ran on back,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.176
and basically was like,
"I'm thinking about my future now."

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.616
(Laughter)

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.960
"Can we go out?"

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.496
For the record, she's even more amazing.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.736
I married her.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.520
(Applause)

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.016
So when I randomly ran down
to the junior college

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.416
and registered for classes,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.136
I really wasn't paying attention
to what I was registering to.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.416
(Laughter)

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.176
So I ended up with an art history class,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.440
and I didn't know a thing
about art history.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.080
But something amazing happened
when I went into that class.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.496
For the first time in my academic career,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.896
my visual intelligence was required of me.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.536
For the first time.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.616
The professor would put up an image,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.776
bold strokes of blues and yellows,
and say, "Who's that?"

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.696
And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh.
Clearly that is Van Gogh.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.296
I got this."

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.256
(Laughter)

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.216
I got a B in that class.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.480
For me, that was amazing.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.656
In high school, let's just say
I wasn't a great student. OK?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.096
In high school, my GPA was .65.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.616
(Laughter)

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.936
Decimal point first, six five.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.096
So me getting a B was huge, huge,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.856
absolutely huge.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.816
And because of the fact that I realized
that I was able to learn things visually

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.576
that I couldn't learn in other ways,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.456
this became my strategy,
this became my tactic

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360
for understanding everything else.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.696
I wanted to stay in this relationship.
Things were going well.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.376
I decided, let me keep taking
these art history classes.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.976
One of the last art history classes,
I will not forget, I will never forget.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.216
It was one of those survey
art history classes.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.976
Anybody ever have one of those
survey art history classes,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.936
where they try to teach you
the entire history of art

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.416
in a single semester?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.456
I'm talking about cave paintings
and Jackson Pollock

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.736
just crunched together all in the same --

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.040
It doesn't really work,
but they try anyway.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.176
Well, at the beginning of the semester,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.416
I looked at the book,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.376
and in this 400-page book
was about a 14-page section

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.496
that was on black people in painting.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.536
Now, this was a crammed in section

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.936
that had representations
of black people in painting

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.696
and black people who painted.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.016
It was poorly curated,
let's just put it that way.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.256
(Laughter)

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.616
Nonetheless I was really excited about it,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.936
because in all
the other classes that I had,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.600
we didn't even have that conversation.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.600
We didn't talk about it at all.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.456
So imagine my surprise

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.056
when I get to class

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.296
and on the day that we're supposed
to go over that particular chapter,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.840
my professor announces,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.056
"We're going to skip this chapter today

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.240
because we do not have time
to go through it."

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.696
"Whoa, I'm sorry,
hold on, professor, professor.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.520
I'm sorry. This is a really
important chapter to me.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.576
Are we going to go over it at any point?"

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.416
"Titus, we don't have time for this."

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.536
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.296
please, I really need to understand.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.736
Clearly the author thinks
that this is significant.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.296
Why are we skipping over this?"

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.336
"Titus, I do not have time for this."

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.616
"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.696
When can we talk,
because we need to talk."

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.536
(Laughter)

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.120
I went to her office hours.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.336
I ended up getting kicked
out of her office.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.856
I went to the dean.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.936
The dean finally told me,
"I can't force her to teach anything."

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.016
And I knew in that moment
if I wanted to understand this history,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.456
if I wanted to understand the roles
of those folks who had to walk,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.360
I was probably going
to have to figure that out myself.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.800
So ...

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.532
above you right here on the slide

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.640
is a painting by Frans Hals.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.936
This is one of the kinds of images

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.520
that was in that chapter.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.416
I taught myself how to paint

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.360
by going to museums
and looking at images like this.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.021
I want to show you something.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.320
I made this.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.536
I --

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.976
(Applause)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.256
I made some alterations.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.240
You'll see there are
some slight differences in the painting.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.536
All this art history
that I had been absorbing

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.920
helped me to realize
that painting is a language.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.480
There is a reason

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.720
why he is the highest
in the composition here.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.560
There is a reason

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.080
why the painter is showing us
this gold necklace here.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.376
He's trying to tell us something
about the economic status

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.067
of these people in these paintings.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.256
Painting is a visual language

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.776
where everything in the painting

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.496
is meaningful, is important.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.760
It's coded.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.696
But sometimes, because
of the compositional structure,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.520
because of compositional hierarchy,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.520
it's hard to see other things.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.880
This silk is supposed to tell us also
that they have quite a bit of money.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.496
There's more written

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.480
about dogs in art history

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.280
than there are about
this other character here.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.296
Historically speaking,
in research on these kinds of paintings,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.296
I can find out more about the lace

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.296
that the woman is wearing
in this painting --

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.056
the manufacturer of the lace --
than I can about this character here,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.216
about his dreams, about his hopes,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.120
about what he wanted out of life.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.760
I want to show you something.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.056
I don't want you to think

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.016
that this is about eradication.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.256
It's not.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.416
The oil that you saw me
just put inside of this paint

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.936
is linseed oil.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.776
It becomes transparent over time,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.520
so eventually what's going to happen

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.480
is these faces

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.560
will emerge a little bit.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.600
What I'm trying to do,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.654
what I'm trying to show you,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.776
is how to shift your gaze just slightly,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.696
just momentarily,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.136
just momentarily,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.720
to ask yourself the question,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.336
why do some have to walk?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.616
What is the impact of these kinds
of sculptures at museums?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.216
What is the impact
of these kinds of paintings

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.136
on some of our most vulnerable in society,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.000
seeing these kinds of depictions
of themselves all the time?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.976
I'm not saying erase it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.440
We can't erase this history.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.240
It's real. We have to know it.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.816
I think of it in the same way

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.080
we think of --

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.856
Let me step back a second.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.216
You remember old-school cameras,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.536
where when you took a picture,
you actually had to focus. Right?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.816
You'd put the camera up,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.816
and if I wanted you in focus,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.840
I would move the lens a little to the left

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.176
and you would come forward.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.296
I could move the lens
a little to the right,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.576
and you would go back and the folks
in the background would come out.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.616
I'm just trying to do that here.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.216
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.456
I'm trying to answer that question

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.920
that my son had.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.056
I want to make paintings,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.336
I want to make sculptures

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.880
that are honest,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.640
that wrestle with
the struggles of our past

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.960
but speak to the diversity
and the advances of our present.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.056
And we can't do that by taking an eraser
and getting rid of stuff.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.816
That's just not going to work.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.936
I think that we should
do it in the same way

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.536
the American Constitution works.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.816
When we have a situation

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.696
where we want to change
a law in the American Constitution,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.496
we don't erase the other one.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.736
Alongside that is an amendment,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.016
something that says,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.800
"This is where we were,
but this is where we are right now."

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.896
I figure if we can do that,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.256
then that will help us
understand a little bit

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.480
about where we're going.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.696
Thank you.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.360
(Applause)
