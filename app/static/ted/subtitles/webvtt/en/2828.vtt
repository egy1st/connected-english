00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.536
So 24 years ago,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.336
I was brought to The New Yorker

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.880
as art editor

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.016
to rejuvenate

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.056
what had by then become
a somewhat staid institution

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.576
and to bring in new artists

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.296
and to try to bring the magazine
from its ivory tower

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.656
into engaging with its time.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.376
And it was just
the right thing for me to do

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.016
because I've always been captivated
by how an image can --

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.736
a simple drawing --

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.496
can cut through the torrent of images
that we see every single day.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.976
How it can capture a moment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.216
how it can crystallize
a social trend or a complex event

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.416
in a way that a lot of words
wouldn't be able to do --

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.240
and reduce it to its essence
and turn it into a cartoon.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.576
So I went to the library

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.536
and I looked at the first cover
drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 --

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.960
a dandy looking at a butterfly
through his monocle,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.520
and we call it Eustace Tilley.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.096
And I realized that
as the magazine had become known

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.576
for its in-depth research
and long reports,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.536
some of the humor
had gotten lost along the way,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.456
because now often Eustace Tilley
was seen as a haughty dandy,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.576
but in fact, in 1925,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.016
when Rea Irvin first drew this image,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.816
he did it as part of a humor magazine

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.056
to amuse the youth of the era,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.160
which was the flappers
of the roaring twenties.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.336
And in the library,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.296
I found the images
that really captured the zeitgeist

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.736
of the Great Depression.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.176
And it showed us
not just how people dressed

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.736
or what their cars looked like,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.016
but also what made them laugh,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.336
what their prejudices were.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.936
And you really got a sense

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.440
of what it felt like
to be alive in the '30s.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.336
So I called on contemporary artists,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.576
such as Adrian Tomine here.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.736
I often call on narrative artists --

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.416
cartoonists, children's book authors --

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.960
and I give them themes such as,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.176
you know, what it's like
to be in the subway,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.376
or Valentine's Day,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.776
and they send me sketches.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.696
And once the sketches
are approved by the editor,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.080
David Remnick,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.336
it's a go.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.336
And I love the way

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.616
those images are actually
not telling you what to think.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.856
But they do make you think,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.896
because the artist is actually --

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.176
it's almost a puzzle;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.696
the artist is drawing the dots,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.416
and you, the reader,
have to complete the picture.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.816
So to get this image
on the left by Anita Kunz,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.896
or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.056
you have to play spot the differences.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.000
And it is something that ...

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.416
It's really exciting to see

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.496
how the engagement with the reader ...

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.456
how those images really capture --

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.016
play with the stereotypes.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.416
But when you get it,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.000
it rearranges the stereotypes
that are in your head.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.856
But the images don't
just have to show people,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.216
sometimes it can be a feeling.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.280
Right after September 11,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.776
I was at a point,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.016
like everybody else,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.256
where I really didn't know how to deal
with what we were going through,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.696
and I felt that no image
could capture this moment,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.216
and I wanted to just do a black cover,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.936
like no cover.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.656
And I talked to my husband,
cartoonist Art Spiegelman,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.536
and mentioned to him
that I was going to propose that,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.136
and he said, "Oh, if you're
going to do a black cover,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.176
then why don't you do
the silhouette of the Twin Towers,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.736
black on black?"

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.296
And I sat down to draw this,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.800
and as soon as I saw it,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.456
a shiver ran down my spine

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.680
and I realized

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.296
that in this refusal to make an image,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.336
we had found a way to capture loss

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.856
and mourning

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.160
and absence.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.256
And it's been a profound thing
that I learned in the process --

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.216
that sometimes some of the images
that say the most

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.320
do it with the most spare means.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.456
And a simple image can speak volumes.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.736
So this is the image
that we published by Bob Staake

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.600
right after the election of Barack Obama,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.296
and captured a historic moment.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.536
But we can't really plan for this,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.936
because in order to do this,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.296
we have to let the artist
experience the emotions that we all feel

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.800
when that is happening.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.136
So back in November 2016,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.936
during the election last year,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.096
the only image that we
could publish was this,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.056
which was on the stand
on the week that everybody voted.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.416
(Laughter)

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.896
Because we knew
somebody would feel this --

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.136
(Laughter)

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.840
when the result of the election
was announced.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.320
And when we found out the result,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.456
we really were at a loss,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.496
and this is the image
that was sent by Bob Staake again,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.560
and that really hit a chord.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.536
And again,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.016
we can't really figure out
what's going to come next,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.736
but here it felt like we didn't
know how to move forward,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.216
but we did move forward,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.456
and this is the image that we published
after Donald Trump's election

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.896
and at the time of the Women's March

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.240
all over the US.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.976
So over those 24 years,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.776
I have seen over 1,000 images
come to life week after week,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.376
and I'm often asked
which one is my favorite,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.256
but I can't pick one

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.216
because what I'm most proud of
is how different every image is,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.456
one from the other.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.936
And that's due to the talent
and the diversity

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.920
of all of the artists that contribute.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.376
And now, well,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.256
now, we're owned by Russia,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.496
so --

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.736
(Laughter)

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.456
In a rendering by Barry Blitt here,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.696
Eustace has become
Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.816
And the butterfly is none other
than a flabbergasted Donald Trump

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.056
flapping his wings,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.136
trying to figure out
how to control the butterfly effect,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.736
and the famed logo
that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.360
is now in Cyrillic.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.176
So, what makes me really excited
about this moment

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.960
is the way that ...

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.736
You know, free press
is essential to our democracy.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.416
And we can see from
the sublime to the ridiculous

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.856
that artists can capture what is going on

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.496
in a way that an artist

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.656
armed with just India ink and watercolor

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.656
can capture and enter
into the cultural dialogue.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.656
It puts those artists
at the center of that culture,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.496
and that's exactly
where I think they should be.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.920
Because the main thing we need
right now is a good cartoon.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.616
Thank you.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.120
(Applause)
