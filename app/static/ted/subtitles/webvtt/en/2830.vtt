00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:03.000
The first time

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.024
I felt fear

00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:07.284
I was 41 years old.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:11.096
People have always said I was brave.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.298
When I was little,
I'd climb the highest tree,

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.842
and I'd approach any animal fearlessly.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.556
I liked challenges.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.620
My father used to say,

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:27.226
"Good steel can withstand
any temperature."

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.336
And when I entered into
Colombian politics,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.926
I thought I'd be able
to withstand any temperature.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.121
I wanted to end corruption;

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:41.324
I wanted to cut ties between politicians
and drug traffickers.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:44.006
The first time I was elected,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.713
it was because I called out, by name,

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:49.758
corrupt and untouchable politicians.

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:52.698
I also called out the president

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.478
for his ties to the cartels.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.767
That's when the threats started.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.961
I had to send my very young children
out of the country one morning,

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:10.147
hidden, all the way to the airport,
in the French ambassador's armored car.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:11.985
Days later,

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:15.545
I was the victim of an attack,
but emerged unharmed.

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:18.447
The following year,

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:22.822
the Colombian people elected me
with the highest number of votes.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.418
I thought people applauded me
because I was brave.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.531
I, too, thought I was brave.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.863
But I wasn't.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.446
I had simply never before experienced

00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:41.325
true fear.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:43.913
That changed

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.627
on February 23, 2002.

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:52.526
At the time, I was a presidential
candidate in Colombia

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.557
promoting my campaign agenda,

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:59.814
when I was detained
by a group of armed men.

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:03.217
They were wearing uniforms
with military garments.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.343
I looked at their boots; they were rubber.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.776
And I knew

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.101
that the Colombian army
wore leather boots.

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:15.621
I knew that these were FARC guerrillas.

00:02:16.248 --> 00:02:18.978
From that point on,
everything happened very quickly.

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:25.143
The commando leader ordered us
to stop the vehicle.

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.202
Meanwhile, one of his men
stepped on an antipersonnel mine

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.008
and flew through the air.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.754
He landed, sitting upright,

00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:38.085
right in front of me.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.109
We made eye contact

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.370
and it was then
that the young man understood:

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.909
his rubber boot with his leg still in it

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.378
had landed far away.

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.114
(Sighs)

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:54.234
He started

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.122
screaming like crazy.

00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:02.321
And the truth is,

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:09.140
I felt -- as I feel right now,
because I'm reliving these emotions --

00:03:09.164 --> 00:03:12.797
I felt at that moment
that something inside of me was breaking

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.623
and that I was being infected
with his fear.

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:19.511
My mind went blank and couldn't think;

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:20.710
it was paralyzed.

00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:23.116
When I finally reacted,

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.518
I said to myself,

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:28.173
"They're going to kill me,

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.649
and I didn't say goodbye to my children."

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:39.031
As they took me into
the deepest depths of the jungle,

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:42.583
the FARC soldiers announced

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.349
that if the government didn't negotiate,

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:47.830
they'd kill me.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.604
And I knew

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.601
that the government wouldn't negotiate.

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.348
From that point on,

00:03:58.078 --> 00:04:01.170
I went to sleep in fear every night --

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:02.614
cold sweats,

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.502
shaking,

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:07.367
stomach ache,

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.648
insomnia.

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:12.553
But worse than that
was what was happening to my mind,

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:17.076
because my memory was being erased:
all the phone numbers,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.587
addresses,

00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.680
names of very dear people,

00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:24.383
even significant life events.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.888
And so,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.574
I began to doubt myself,
to doubt my mental health.

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:36.015
And with doubt came desperation,

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.839
and with desperation came depression.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.745
I was suffering notorious
behavioral changes

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.396
and it wasn't just paranoia
in moments of panic.

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.911
It was distrust,

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:52.122
it was hatred,

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.817
and it was also the urge to kill.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.021
This, I realized

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:02.606
when they had me
chained by the neck to a tree.

00:05:03.947 --> 00:05:07.234
They kept me outside that day,

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.001
during a tropical downpour.

00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:16.538
I remember feeling an urgent need
to use the bathroom.

00:05:21.012 --> 00:05:22.549
"Whatever you have to do,

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:26.796
you'll do in front of me,

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.875
bitch,"

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.590
the guard screamed at me.

00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:50.462
And I

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.586
decided at that moment

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.073
to kill him.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:13.003
And for days,

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.719
I was planning, trying to find
the right moment, the right way to do it,

00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:20.228
filled with hatred,

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:21.426
filled with fear.

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:23.956
Then suddenly,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.240
I rose up,

00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:26.612
snapped out of it

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.602
and thought:

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.689
"I'm not going to become one of them.

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:33.713
I'm not going to become an assassin.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.968
I still have enough freedom

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:42.345
to decide

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:44.901
who I want to be."

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.825
That's when I learned that fear

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.314
brought me face to face with myself.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:56.410
It forced me

00:06:57.392 --> 00:06:59.854
to align my energies,

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.446
to align my meridians.

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.214
I learned that facing fear

00:07:07.897 --> 00:07:11.429
could become a pathway to growth.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.428
A lot of emotions arise
when I talk about all of this,

00:07:17.118 --> 00:07:19.305
but when I think back,

00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:22.231
I'm able to identify

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.617
the steps I took to do it.

00:07:26.273 --> 00:07:29.674
I want to share three of them with you.

00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:31.772
The first

00:07:33.563 --> 00:07:35.663
was to be guided by principles.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:37.784
Because I realized

00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:40.624
that in the midst of panic
and mental block,

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:44.790
if I followed my principles,

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.493
I acted correctly.

00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:51.616
I remember the first night

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.488
in a concentration camp
that the guerrillas had built

00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:56.850
in the middle of the jungle,

00:07:57.628 --> 00:08:00.982
with 12-foot-high bars,

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:02.611
barbed wire,

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:04.975
lookouts in the four corners

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:08.371
and armed men pointing
guns at us 24 hours a day.

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:11.659
That morning, the first morning,

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:15.565
some men arrived, yelling:

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:17.422
"Count off! Count off!"

00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:22.926
My fellow hostages woke up, startled,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.278
and began to identify themselves
in numbered sequence.

00:08:26.817 --> 00:08:28.468
But when it was my turn,

00:08:29.912 --> 00:08:31.065
I said,

00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:33.383
"Ingrid Betancourt.

00:08:33.407 --> 00:08:36.445
If you want to know if I'm here,
call me by my name."

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:39.565
The guards' fury

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:43.317
was nothing compared
to that of the other hostages,

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.095
because, obviously they were scared --

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:48.528
we were all scared --

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:51.962
and they were afraid that, because of me,
they would be punished.

00:08:52.656 --> 00:08:53.927
But for me,

00:08:53.951 --> 00:09:00.612
beyond fear was the need
to defend my identity,

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:04.183
to not let them turn me into
a thing or a number.

00:09:04.207 --> 00:09:05.777
That was one of the principles:

00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:08.318
to defend

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:12.036
what I considered to be human dignity.

00:09:13.457 --> 00:09:15.360
But make no mistake:

00:09:15.384 --> 00:09:17.384
the guerrillas had it all

00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:20.361
very well analyzed --

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.576
they had been kidnapping for years,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.077
and they had developed a technique

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:28.650
to break us,

00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:30.434
to defeat us, to divide us.

00:09:31.015 --> 00:09:32.242
And so,

00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:34.550
the second step

00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:39.164
was to learn how to build
supportive trust,

00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:41.592
to learn how to unite.

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:46.531
The jungle is like a different planet.

00:09:47.713 --> 00:09:50.298
It's a world

00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:54.546
of shadows, of rain,

00:09:56.117 --> 00:10:00.707
with the hum of millions of bugs --

00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:02.936
majiña ants, bullet ants.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.951
I didn't stop scratching a single day
while I was in the jungle.

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:13.799
And of course, there were tarantulas,
scorpions, anacondas ...

00:10:13.823 --> 00:10:18.026
I once came face to face
with a 24-foot long anaconda

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.204
that could have swallowed me in one bite.

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:21.410
Jaguars ...

00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:24.101
But I want to tell you

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:28.172
that none of these animals
did us as much harm

00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.238
as the human beings.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:37.385
The guerrillas terrorized us.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.028
They spread rumors.

00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:44.588
Among the hostages,
they sparked betrayals,

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:46.735
jealousy,

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:48.584
resentment,

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.566
mistrust.

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:58.249
The first time I escaped
for a long time was with Lucho.

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:01.082
Lucho had been a hostage
for two years longer than I had.

00:11:01.737 --> 00:11:04.769
We decided to tie ourselves up

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.337
with ropes

00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:11.778
to have the strength
to lower ourselves into that dark water

00:11:11.802 --> 00:11:14.826
full of piranhas and alligators.

00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:20.922
What we did was, during the day,
we would hide in the mangroves.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:23.549
And at night,

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:25.626
we would leave, get in the water,

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:29.792
and we would swim
and let the current carry us.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.152
That went on for several days.

00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.572
But Lucho

00:11:37.184 --> 00:11:38.542
became sick.

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:39.880
He was diabetic,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.269
and he fell into a diabetic coma.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:47.536
So the guerrillas captured us.

00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:52.019
But after having lived
through that with Lucho,

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:55.558
after having faced fear together, united,

00:11:56.551 --> 00:12:00.099
not punishment, not violence -- nothing --

00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:04.205
could ever again divide us.

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:09.094
What's certain is,

00:12:09.118 --> 00:12:12.914
all the guerrillas' manipulation
was so damaging to us

00:12:14.237 --> 00:12:16.019
that even today,

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:19.068
among some of the hostages

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:22.068
from back then,

00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.276
tensions linger,

00:12:26.284 --> 00:12:29.759
passed down from all that poison

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:33.766
that the guerrillas created.

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.227
The third step

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.036
is very important to me,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.420
and it's a gift
that I want to give to you.

00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:48.905
The third step is to learn
how to develop faith.

00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:54.941
I want to explain it like this:

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.245
Jhon Frank Pinchao

00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:00.437
was a police officer

00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:02.881
who had been a hostage
for more than eight years.

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:07.471
He was famous for being
the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:13.098
But Pincho -- I called him "Pincho" --

00:13:13.122 --> 00:13:17.777
Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.

00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:19.735
And he asked me to help him.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:23.264
By that point, I basically had
a master's degree in escape attempts.

00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:24.713
(Laughter)

00:13:25.192 --> 00:13:26.424
So

00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:29.929
we got started but we had a delay,

00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:32.612
because first, Pincho
had to learn how to swim.

00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:38.329
And we had to carry out
all these preparations in total secrecy.

00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:42.413
Anyway, when we finally
had everything ready,

00:13:42.437 --> 00:13:46.607
Pincho came up to me
one afternoon and said,

00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:49.790
"Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,

00:13:49.814 --> 00:13:53.435
and I go around and around in circles,
and I can't find the way out.

00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:54.629
What do I do?"

00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:57.203
"Pincho,

00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:00.058
you grab a phone,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.859
and you call the man upstairs."

00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:07.138
"Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God."

00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:14.466
"God doesn't care. He'll still help you."

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:20.357
(Applause)

00:14:23.627 --> 00:14:26.148
It rained all night that night.

00:14:27.204 --> 00:14:28.685
The following morning,

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:31.993
the camp woke up to a big commotion,

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.701
because Pincho had fled.

00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:37.486
They made us dismantle the camp,
and we started marching.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.773
During the march,

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:44.885
the head guerrillas told us
that Pincho had died,

00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:48.044
and that they had found his remains

00:14:48.068 --> 00:14:49.599
eaten by an anaconda.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.253
Seventeen days passed --

00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:59.628
and believe me, I counted them,
because they were torture for me.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.160
But on the seventeenth day,

00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:08.099
the news exploded from the radio:

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:11.337
Pincho was free and obviously alive.

00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:15.708
And this was the first thing he said:

00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:19.052
"I know my fellow hostages are listening.

00:15:19.813 --> 00:15:21.307
Ingrid,

00:15:21.331 --> 00:15:23.053
I did what you told me.

00:15:23.077 --> 00:15:24.748
I called the man upstairs,

00:15:24.772 --> 00:15:28.313
and he sent me the patrol
that rescued me from the jungle."

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:34.477
That was an extraordinary moment,

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:35.667
because ...

00:15:36.278 --> 00:15:38.278
obviously fear is contagious.

00:15:38.909 --> 00:15:40.339
But faith is, too.

00:15:40.363 --> 00:15:43.002
Faith isn't rational or emotional.

00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:44.993
Faith

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.656
is an exercise of the will.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:51.901
It's the discipline of the will.

00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:55.824
It's what allows us to transform
everything that we are --

00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:58.146
our weaknesses, our frailties,

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.760
into strength, into power.

00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.784
It's truly a transformation.

00:16:02.821 --> 00:16:05.682
It's what gives us the strength

00:16:05.706 --> 00:16:07.087
to stand up

00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:09.649
in the face of fear

00:16:10.664 --> 00:16:12.388
look above it,

00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:13.810
and see beyond it.

00:16:16.222 --> 00:16:18.222
I hope you remember that,

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:21.620
because I know we all need

00:16:22.643 --> 00:16:25.637
to connect with that strength
we have inside of us

00:16:26.237 --> 00:16:30.679
for the times when there's a storm
raging around our boat.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.849
Many, many, many, many years passed

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:42.188
before I could return to my house.

00:16:44.116 --> 00:16:49.145
But when they took us, handcuffed,
into the helicopter

00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:51.224
that finally took us out of the jungle,

00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:54.493
everything happened as quickly
as when they kidnapped me.

00:16:55.977 --> 00:16:57.609
In an instant,

00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:01.656
I saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.905
gagged,

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:06.012
and the rescue leader,

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.354
yelling:

00:17:09.107 --> 00:17:12.522
"We're the Colombian army!

00:17:12.547 --> 00:17:14.926
You are free!"

00:17:16.483 --> 00:17:18.021
The shriek

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.872
that came out of all of us

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:22.887
when we regained our freedom,

00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:27.952
continues to vibrate in me to this day.

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:31.440
Now,

00:17:32.543 --> 00:17:35.750
I know they can divide all of us,

00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:38.191
they can manipulate us all with fear.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:45.094
The "No" vote on the peace
referendum in Colombia;

00:17:45.118 --> 00:17:46.887
Brexit;

00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:50.658
the idea of a wall
between Mexico and the United States;

00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.005
Islamic terrorism --

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:57.326
they're all examples
of using fear politically

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.617
to divide and recruit us.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.370
We all feel fear.

00:18:05.092 --> 00:18:08.459
But we can all avoid being recruited

00:18:09.434 --> 00:18:14.546
using the resources we have --
our principles, unity, faith.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:19.447
Yes, fear is part of the human condition,

00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:22.750
as well as being necessary for survival.

00:18:23.385 --> 00:18:25.124
But above all,

00:18:25.148 --> 00:18:29.904
it's the guide by which each of us builds

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:33.922
our identity, our personality.

00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:43.809
It's true, I was 41 years old
the first time I felt fear,

00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:47.413
and feeling fear was not my decision.

00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:52.933
But it was my decision
what to do with that fear.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:58.646
You can survive

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.461
crawling along, fearful.

00:19:03.078 --> 00:19:04.558
But you can also

00:19:06.027 --> 00:19:08.562
rise above the fear,

00:19:08.586 --> 00:19:11.398
rise up, spread your wings,

00:19:11.422 --> 00:19:16.099
and soar, fly high, high, high, high,
until you reach the stars,

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:19.149
where all of us want to go.

00:19:21.547 --> 00:19:22.699
Thank you.

00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:26.531
(Applause)
