WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.683
So, imagine that you take
a 19-hour, very long drive

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:09.342
to Disney World,

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.870
with two kids in the back seat.

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:17.388
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.245
the immutable laws of nature dictate

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.325
that you get the question:

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.713
"Are we there yet?"

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:25.994
(Laughter)

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:30.006
So you answer this question
a hundred more times, easily,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.189
in the negative,

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:32.613
but you finally arrive.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:35.410
You have a wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful trip.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:40.211
You drive 19 long hours back home.

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:43.075
And when you get there,

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:44.716
the police are waiting on you.

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:47.609
They accuse you of committing a crime

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.900
that occurred while you
were away in Florida.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.746
You tell anybody and everybody
who will listen,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.233
"I didn't do it!

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:57.608
I couldn't have done it!

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:01.470
I was hanging out with Mickey
and Minnie and my kids!"

00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:04.003
But no one believes you.

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:07.125
Ultimately, you're arrested,

00:01:07.804 --> 00:01:09.047
you're tried,

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.371
you're convicted

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:11.688
and you are sentenced.

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:15.282
And you spend 25 years in jail,

00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:19.612
until someone comes along and proves --

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:22.988
has the evidence to prove --

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.656
that you actually were in Florida

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.449
when this crime was committed.

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:30.966
So.

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:33.485
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.650
and the last several years,
I have worked on

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.824
winning the release of innocent people

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:43.566
who've been wrongfully convicted --

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.973
people like Jonathan Fleming,

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:50.051
who spent 24 years, eight months in jail

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:53.673
for a murder that was committed
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:57.180
while he was in Disney World

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:58.477
with his kids.

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:00.296
How do we know this?

00:02:00.882 --> 00:02:02.533
Because when he was arrested,

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:06.079
among his property in his back pocket

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.107
was a receipt --

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.862
time-stamped receipt

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:13.747
that showed that he was in Disney World.

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:17.447
That receipt was put in the police file,

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.097
a copy of it was put
in the prosecutor's file,

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:23.353
and they never gave it
to his public defender.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.319
In fact, nobody even knew it was there.

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.082
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.477
My team looked through the file,
and we found it,

00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:35.129
did the rest of the investigation,

00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:37.440
and figured out someone else
committed the crime.

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:40.604
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.567
and he is now released.

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.103
Let me give you a little bit of context.

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.940
So about three years ago, I got a call
from the Brooklyn District Attorney.

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:54.047
He asked whether I'd be interested
in designing a program

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.049
called a "conviction review unit."

00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.354
So I said yes.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:02.045
A conviction review unit is essentially
a unit in a prosecutor's office

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.186
where prosecutors look at their past cases

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.821
to determine whether or not
they made mistakes.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.497
Over the course of the first year,

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.615
we found about 13 wrongful convictions,

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.174
people having been in jail for decades,

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:17.833
and we released all of them.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:20.535
It was the most in New York history.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.051
The program is still going on,

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.342
and they're up to 21 releases now --

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:29.722
21 people who spent
significant time behind bars.

00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:35.711
So let me tell you about a couple other
of the men and women

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:39.019
that I interacted with
in the course of this program.

00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:41.418
One name is Roger Logan.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.302
Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:46.806
and wrote me a letter.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.973
It was a simple letter; it basically said,

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:52.051
"Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent.
I've been framed.

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:53.430
Can you look at my case?"

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.423
At first blush, the case seemed
like it was open and shut,

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.480
but my research had shown

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:03.115
that single-witness identification cases

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.417
are prone to error.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.176
It doesn't mean he was innocent,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.517
it just means we ought to look
a little bit closer at those cases.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.851
So we did.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.876
And the facts were relatively simple.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.982
The eyewitness said she heard a shot,

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.057
and she ran to the next building
and turned around and looked,

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.662
and there was Mr. Logan.

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:26.716
And he was tried and convicted
and in jail for 17-some-odd years.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.554
But it was a single-witness case,
so we took a look at it.

00:04:29.578 --> 00:04:32.698
I sent some people to the scene,
and there was an inconsistency.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:37.859
And to put it politely:

00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:41.542
Usain Bolt couldn't have run
from where she said she was

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:42.754
to the other spot.

00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:43.930
Right?

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:46.371
So we knew that wasn't true.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.022
So it still didn't mean
that he didn't do it,

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:53.030
but we knew something was maybe fishy
about this witness.

00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:55.668
So we looked through the file,

00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:58.031
a piece of paper in the file
had a number on it.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.021
The number indicated
that this witness had a record.

00:05:01.045 --> 00:05:04.853
We went back through 20 years
of non-digitized papers

00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:07.453
to figure out what this record was about,

00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:09.964
and it turned out -- it turned out --

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:13.496
the eyewitness was in jail

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.439
when she said she saw what she saw.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.931
The man spent 17 years behind bars.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:26.243
The last one is a case about two boys,

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.088
Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:30.587
They were arrested at 15,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.520
and their conviction was vacated
29 years later.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:38.659
Now this was a case,

00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:41.487
once again -- first blush,
it looked open and shut.

00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:42.783
They had confessed.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.501
But my research showed
that juvenile confessions

00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:48.014
without a parent present

00:05:48.038 --> 00:05:49.473
are prone to error.

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:51.763
The DNA cases proved this several times.

00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:53.161
So we took a close look.

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:55.557
We looked at the confession,

00:05:55.581 --> 00:05:56.745
and it turned out,

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:58.631
there was something in the confession

00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:00.623
that those boys could not have known.

00:06:00.647 --> 00:06:03.378
The only people who knew it
were police and prosecutors.

00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:05.673
We knew what really happened;

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:07.256
someone told them to say this.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.149
We don't exactly know who,

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:10.640
which person did,

00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:13.559
but any rate, the confession was coerced,

00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:14.937
we determined.

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:17.254
We then went back and did forensics

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:18.964
and did a fulsome investigation

00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:20.384
and found that two other,

00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:23.267
much older, different heights,
different hairstyle,

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:25.625
two other people committed the crime,

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:26.919
not these two boys.

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.386
I actually went to court that day,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.952
for what's called a "vacatur hearing,"

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.087
where the conviction is thrown out.

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:36.813
I went to court; I wanted to see

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.968
Mr. McCallum walk out of there.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:41.146
So I went to court,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.939
and the judge said something
that judges say all the time,

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.172
but this took on a really special meaning.

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.313
He looked up after the arguments and said,

00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:50.540
"Mr. McCallum,"

00:06:51.108 --> 00:06:52.997
he said five beautiful words:

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:57.045
"You are free to go."

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:00.153
Can you imagine?

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:02.555
After just about 30 years:

00:07:03.315 --> 00:07:04.844
"You are free to go."

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.504
And he walked out of that courtroom.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:12.774
Unfortunately,
his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.928
didn't get the benefit of that.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.335
You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.268
at 34 years old,

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:23.684
and his mother sat
at counsel table in his place.

00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:27.456
I'll never forget this
the rest of my life.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.457
She just rocked at the table, saying,

00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:32.441
"I knew my baby didn't do this.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.684
I knew my baby didn't do this."

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.091
And her baby didn't do this.

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:38.051
Two other guys did it.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:42.403
If there's anything that we've learned,
anything that I've learned,

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:45.615
with this conviction integrity work,

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.578
it's that justice doesn't happen.

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:53.608
People make justice happen.

00:07:56.441 --> 00:08:00.336
Justice is not a thing
that just descends from above

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.740
and makes everything right.

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:06.585
If it did, Mr. Stuckey
wouldn't have died in prison.

00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:09.479
Justice is something

00:08:09.503 --> 00:08:12.601
that people of goodwill make happen.

00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:17.480
Justice is a decision.

00:08:20.392 --> 00:08:22.120
Justice is a decision.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.801
We make justice happen.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.225
You know, the scary thing is,

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:30.866
in each of these three cases I described,

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.492
it would have only taken
just an extra minute --

00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:35.131
an extra minute --

00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:37.298
for someone to look through the file

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:38.810
and find this receipt.

00:08:39.804 --> 00:08:42.860
Just one -- to look through the file,
find the receipt,

00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:45.551
give it to the public defender.

00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:49.424
It would have taken someone just a minute

00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:54.095
to look at the video confession
and say, "That cannot be."

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:56.465
Just a minute.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.684
And perhaps Mr. Stuckey
would be alive today.

00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:04.832
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:09.139
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays
would always recite,

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:10.876
and he called it "God's Minute."

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.473
And it goes something like this:

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:14.614
"I have only just a minute,

00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:16.665
only 60 seconds in it,

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.964
forced upon me, can't refuse it,

00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:21.254
didn't seek it, didn't choose it.

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:22.832
But it's up to me to use it.

00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:26.294
I must suffer if I lose it,
give account if I abuse it.

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.429
Just a tiny little minute,

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:32.585
but eternity is in it."

00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:35.453
If I were to charge

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:37.110
each and every one of us,

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:40.343
I would want to say something like,

00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:43.114
"Every day,

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:45.019
every day,

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:47.999
take just one extra minute

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.176
and do some justice.

00:09:52.932 --> 00:09:54.334
You don't have to --

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:58.371
I mean, some people spend
their careers and their lives,

00:09:58.395 --> 00:09:59.633
like public defenders,

00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:00.897
doing justice every day.

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:04.526
But in your professional lives,
whatever you do,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.240
take time out

00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:07.428
to just

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:09.863
do some justice.

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:11.601
Make a colleague feel better.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:14.634
If you hear something that's sexist,

00:10:15.388 --> 00:10:17.545
don't laugh, speak up.

00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:20.717
If someone is down, lift them up,

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:23.435
one extra minute each day,

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:26.575
and it'll be a great, great place.

00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:28.395
I want to show you something.

00:10:29.957 --> 00:10:32.932
Now, above me is a picture

00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:34.377
of David McCallum.

00:10:35.353 --> 00:10:38.233
This is the day
he was released from prison.

00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:41.314
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece

00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:44.130
he had never been able to touch before.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.735
And I asked him then,

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.262
I said, "What's the first thing
you want to do?"

00:10:50.286 --> 00:10:52.665
And he said, "I just want
to walk on the sidewalk

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:54.870
without anybody telling me where to go."

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.175
Wasn't bitter,

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:59.105
just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:02.842
I spoke to Mr. McCallum
about two weeks ago.

00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:04.543
I went to New York.

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:07.330
It was on the two-year anniversary

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:08.924
of his release.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.920
And we talked,

00:11:10.944 --> 00:11:13.408
we laughed, we hugged, we cried.

00:11:14.035 --> 00:11:16.240
And he's doing quite well.

00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:20.150
And one of the things he said
when we met with him

00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:23.304
is that he now has dedicated his life

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:24.697
and his career

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.880
to ensuring that nobody else
is locked up unjustly.

00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:31.953
Justice, my friends,

00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:34.845
is a decision.

00:11:35.526 --> 00:11:36.733
Thank you very much.

00:11:36.757 --> 00:11:40.897
(Applause)
