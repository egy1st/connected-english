00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you to touch your face.

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.857
Go on.

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:06.989
What do you feel?

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:08.896
Soft? Squishy?

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:12.103
It's you, right? You're feeling you?

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.812
Well, it's not quite true.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.632
You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:21.197
that live on our face and fingers.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.203
You're feeling some of the fungi

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.107
that drifted down
from the air ducts today.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.098
They set off our allergies

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:30.674
and smell of mildew.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:36.189
You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:37.859
that live on our skin.

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:42.359
They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating,

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:44.645
producing the smells of body odor.

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.479
You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria

00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:52.163
that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet,

00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:55.311
or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:57.794
and sprayed onto you
with your last shower.

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.817
Sorry.

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.309
(Laughter)

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.897
You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five

00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.646
to the two species of mites
that live on our faces,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.338
on all of our faces.

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:13.523
They've spent the night
squirming across your face

00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:16.395
and having sex on the bridge of your nose.

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:19.009
(Laughter)

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.132
Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.212
(Laughter)

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:27.700
Now look at your finger.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.467
How's it feel? Gross?

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:32.871
In desperate need of soap or bleach?

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:35.986
That's how you feel now,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.622
but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:41.379
For the last 100 years,

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:43.380
we've had an adversarial relationship

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:46.019
with the microscopic life nearest us.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.165
If I told you there was
a bug in your house

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.423
or bacteria in your sink,

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:51.774
there was a human-devised
solution for that,

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.934
a product to eradicate, exterminate,

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.251
disinfect.

00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:00.718
We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:06.515
But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.755
on this planet.

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:14.270
The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems,

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:19.758
but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems.

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.880
I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers

00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:26.180
at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.798
to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us,

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.685
and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments,

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.867
be it under our couches, in our backyards,

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.310
or in our belly buttons.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.953
I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:45.298
about the microscopic life
that's nearest us.

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.754
As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:51.391
what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home --

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:55.931
your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else.

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:58.347
And so I and teams of others

00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:00.564
are armed with Q-tips and tweezers

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:02.454
and advanced DNA techniques

00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:05.070
to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us.

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:10.282
In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:12.206
that live in USA homes,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.727
everything from spiders and cockroaches

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.319
to tiny mites that cling to feathers.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.415
And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.454
that live in our dust bunnies,

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:29.012
thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers.

00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:31.870
We've gone further still,

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:33.610
and we looked at the microorganisms

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:37.762
that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.918
In each bug, for example, a wasp,

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:46.152
we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate,

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:49.453
a world of hundreds of vibrant species.

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:51.930
Behold the biological cosmos!

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.960
So many of the species
you're looking at right now

00:03:55.984 --> 00:03:57.211
don't yet have names.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.726
Most of the life around us
remains unknown.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.333
I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.851
It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:11.100
It's white and fluffy,

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:13.668
and I named it "mucor nidicola,"

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.695
meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another.

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:20.796
This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.917
because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool.

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:27.002
At the time, I was in graduate school,

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:30.748
and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form.

00:04:30.772 --> 00:04:32.548
I called up my dad, and I go,

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.990
"Dad! I just discovered
a new microorganism species."

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:38.075
And he laughed and he goes,

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.367
"That's great. I hope you also
discovered a cure for it."

00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:42.837
(Laughter)

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:44.033
"Cure it."

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.909
Now, my dad is my biggest fan,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:52.303
so in that crushing moment where he wanted
to kill my new little life form,

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:54.873
I realized that actually I had failed him,

00:04:54.897 --> 00:04:57.058
both as a daughter and a scientist.

00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:01.008
In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards,

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:04.712
investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us,

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:07.272
I'd never made clear
my true mission to him.

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:10.360
My goal is not to find technology

00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:12.784
to kill the new microscopic
life around us.

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:17.447
My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:25.247
The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species.

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:29.239
It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems.

00:05:30.448 --> 00:05:33.149
I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small

00:05:33.173 --> 00:05:34.331
or only has one cell

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:35.674
can do anything powerful,

00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:37.035
but they can.

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.904
These creatures
are microscopic alchemists,

00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:42.786
with the ability to transform
their environment

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.129
with an arsenal of chemical tools.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.908
This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.319
and they can eat whatever
food is around them.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:56.861
This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:02.590
and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:05.456
and even tiny nuggets of real gold.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.290
They can transform the inedible
into nutritive.

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:13.129
They can make sugar into alcohol.

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.839
They give chocolate its flavor,

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:17.599
and soil the power to grow.

00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:19.620
I'm here to tell you

00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:22.791
that the next 100 years will feature
these microscopic creatures

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.420
solving more of our problems.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.233
And we have a lot of problems
to choose from.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.689
We've got the mundane:
bad-smelling clothes or bland food.

00:06:32.464 --> 00:06:34.501
And we've got the monumental:

00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:37.826
disease, pollution, war.

00:06:39.326 --> 00:06:41.010
And so this is my mission:

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:44.264
to not just catalog
the microscopic life around us,

00:06:44.288 --> 00:06:47.537
but to find out what it's uniquely
well-suited to help us with.

00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.046
Here's an example.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.702
We started with a pest,

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:54.074
a wasp that lives on many of our homes.

00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:59.634
Inside that wasp, we plucked out
a little-known microorganism species

00:06:59.658 --> 00:07:01.047
with a unique ability:

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:03.010
it could make beer.

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:07.411
This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:10.296
In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.823
likely came from one of only
three microorganism species.

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.811
Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey,

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:22.238
and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer.

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.876
In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp,

00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:29.904
it could make a valuable sour beer

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:33.387
better than any other species
on this planet.

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:37.800
There are now four species
that produce commercial beer.

00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:41.512
Where you used to see a pest,

00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:44.473
now think of tasting
your future favorite beer.

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:47.454
As a second example,

00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:50.834
I worked with researchers
to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.

00:07:51.493 --> 00:07:55.550
There, we uncovered a microorganism
that could make novel antibiotics,

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:58.707
antibiotics that can kill
the world's worst superbugs.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.899
This was an awesome thing to find,

00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:04.301
but here's the secret:

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:07.084
for the last 60 years,

00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:09.397
most of the antibiotics on the market

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.630
have come from similar soil bacteria.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.294
Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room

00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:17.060
and on this planet,

00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:21.503
are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics.

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:24.898
Where you used to see dirt,

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:26.853
now think of medication.

00:08:28.402 --> 00:08:31.048
Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues

00:08:31.072 --> 00:08:33.968
who are studying
a pond scum microorganism,

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:37.611
which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in.

00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:42.346
It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.892
except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice,

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.967
it vaccinates against PTSD.

00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:51.746
It vaccinates against fear.

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:56.640
Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope.

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.481
There are so many more microbial examples

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:02.649
that I don't have time
to talk about today.

00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:08.506
I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.876
but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.173
might be able to do.

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:18.079
In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.065
or smarter

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:22.912
or perhaps live longer.

00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:26.635
So I want you to look
at your finger again.

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.471
Think about all those
microscopic creatures

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:30.942
that are unknown.

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.971
Think about in the future
what they might be able to do

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:35.168
or make

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.854
or whose life they might be able to save.

00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:40.874
How does your finger feel right now?

00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:43.007
A little bit powerful?

00:09:44.564 --> 00:09:46.591
That's because you're feeling the future.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.372
Thank you.

00:09:48.803 --> 00:09:53.424
(Applause)
