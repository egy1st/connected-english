00:00:00.911 --> 00:00:04.727
My son and the iPhone
were born three weeks apart

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:06.771
in June 2007.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.916
So while those early adopters
were lined up outside,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.865
waiting to get their hands
on this amazing new gadget,

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.833
I was stuck at home
with my hands full of something else

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:20.103
that was sending out
constant notifications --

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:21.960
(Laughter)

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.596
a miserable, colicky baby

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.609
who would only sleep in a moving stroller
with complete silence.

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:33.367
I literally was walking
10 to 15 miles a day,

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.966
and the baby weight came off.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.591
That part was great.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.373
But man, was I bored.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:41.549
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:44.140
who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:46.585
I was one of the first
people into Belgrade

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.110
when there was a revolution in Serbia.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:51.956
Now, I was exhausted.

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.242
This walking went on for weeks.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:01:00.709
It was only until about three months in
that something shifted, though.

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.820
As I pounded the pavement,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:06.007
my mind started to wander, too.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.281
I began imagining what I would do
when I finally did sleep again.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.313
So the colic did fade,

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:15.136
and I finally got an iPhone

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.055
and I put all those hours
of wandering into action.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.995
I created my dream job
hosting a public radio show.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.179
So there was no more
rushing off to war zones,

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:26.105
but thanks to my new smartphone,

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:28.400
I could be a mother and a journalist.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:32.776
I could be on the playground
and on Twitter at the same time.

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.472
Yeah, well, when I thought that,

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:37.543
when the technology came in and took over,

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.717
that is when I hit a wall.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:42.566
So, I want you to picture this:

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.844
you host a podcast, and you have to prove

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:48.288
that the investment
of precious public radio dollars in you

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.488
is worth it.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:53.757
My goal was to increase
my audience size tenfold.

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.245
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.545
as you do,

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.538
and I came up barren.

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.733
This was different
than writer's block, right?

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:04.832
It wasn't like there was something there
waiting to be unearthed.

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:06.280
There was just nothing.

00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:07.782
And so I started to think back:

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.573
When was the last time
I actually had a good idea?

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.347
Yeah, it was when I was pushing
that damn stroller.

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:17.461
Now all the cracks in my day
were filled with phone time.

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:21.010
I checked the headlines
while I waited for my latte.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:25.106
I updated my calendar
while I was sitting on the couch.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.555
Texting turned every spare moment

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.868
into a chance to show to my coworkers
and my dear husband

00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:33.494
what a responsive person I was,

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.403
or at least it was a chance to find
another perfect couch

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.133
for my page on Pinterest.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.824
I realized that I was never bored.

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.618
And anyway, don't only
boring people get bored?

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.590
But then I started to wonder:

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:48.876
What actually happens to us
when we get bored?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.077
Or, more importantly: What happens to us
if we never get bored?

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:58.052
And what could happen if we got rid of
this human emotion entirely?

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:02.327
I started talking to neuroscientists
and cognitive psychologists,

00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.276
and what they told me was fascinating.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.093
It turns out that when you get bored,

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:11.201
you ignite a network in your brain
called the "default mode."

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:16.084
So our body, it goes on autopilot
while we're folding the laundry

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:17.475
or we're walking to work,

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.460
but actually that is when our brain
gets really busy.

00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:23.356
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:26.610
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:
Once you start daydreaming

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.450
and allow your mind to really wander,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.033
you start thinking a little bit
beyond the conscious,

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.780
a little bit into the subconscious,

00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:35.976
which allows sort of different
connections to take place.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.490
It's really awesome, actually.

00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:39.528
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.247
So this is my brain in an fMRI,

00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.224
and I learned that in the default mode
is when we connect disparate ideas,

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:48.758
we solve some of our most
nagging problems,

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:51.823
and we do something called
"autobiographical planning."

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:53.742
This is when we look back at our lives,

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.965
we take note of the big moments,
we create a personal narrative,

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.497
and then we set goals

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.638
and we figure out what steps
we need to take to reach them.

00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:06.111
But now we chill out on the couch
also while updating a Google Doc

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:08.055
or replying to email.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.607
We call it "getting shit done,"

00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:13.669
but here's what neuroscientist
Dr. Daniel Levitin says

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.009
we're actually doing.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.747
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin:
Every time you shift your attention

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:20.083
from one thing to another,

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:22.835
the brain has to engage
a neurochemical switch

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:26.090
that uses up nutrients in the brain
to accomplish that.

00:04:26.114 --> 00:04:28.533
So if you're attempting to multitask,

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:30.880
you know, doing four
or five things at once,

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.445
you're not actually doing
four or five things at once,

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.394
because the brain doesn't work that way.

00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:38.269
Instead, you're rapidly shifting
from one thing to the next,

00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:40.336
depleting neural resources as you go.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.147
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,
you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.

00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.488
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have
a limited supply of that stuff.

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:49.921
MZ: A decade ago, we shifted
our attention at work

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.205
every three minutes.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.122
Now we do it every 45 seconds,

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:55.983
and we do it all day long.

00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:59.343
The average person checks email
74 times a day,

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:01.654
and switches tasks on their computer

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:05.574
566 times a day.

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:09.099
I discovered all this
talking to professor of informatics,

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:10.847
Dr. Gloria Mark.

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:14.853
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find
that when people are stressed,

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:18.048
they tend to shift
their attention more rapidly.

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:20.311
We also found, strangely enough,

00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:26.035
that the shorter the amount of sleep
that a person gets,

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.155
the more likely they are
to check Facebook.

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.221
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:34.343
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.049
What would happen
if we broke this vicious cycle?

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:42.160
Maybe my listeners could help me find out.

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:46.111
What if we reclaimed
those cracks in our day?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.830
Could it help us
jump-start our creativity?

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.648
We called the project
"Bored and Brilliant."

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:59.313
And I expected, you know,
a couple hundred people to play along,

00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:02.414
but thousands of people
started signing up.

00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:04.610
And they told me the reason
they were doing it

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:08.048
was because they were worried
that their relationship with their phone

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:12.240
had grown kind of ...
"codependent," shall we say.

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:15.935
(Audio) Man: The relationship
between a baby and its teddy bear

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.774
or a baby and its binky

00:06:17.798 --> 00:06:21.076
or a baby that wants its mother's cradle

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.122
when it's done with being held
by a stranger --

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:25.198
(Laughs)

00:06:25.222 --> 00:06:28.174
that's the relationship
between me and my phone.

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:30.973
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone
like a power tool:

00:06:30.997 --> 00:06:34.906
extremely useful, but dangerous
if I'm not handling it properly.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.208
(Audio) Woman 2:
If I don't pay close attention,

00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:39.685
I'll suddenly realize
that I've lost an hour of time

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.700
doing something totally mindless.

00:06:41.724 --> 00:06:44.027
MZ: OK, but to really measure
any improvement,

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:45.472
we needed data, right?

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:47.687
Because that's what we do these days.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.849
So we partnered with some apps
that would measure how much time

00:06:50.873 --> 00:06:52.965
we were spending every day on our phone.

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:54.466
If you're thinking it's ironic

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.539
that I asked people
to download another app

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:59.086
so that they would spend
less time on their phones:

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.417
yeah, but you gotta meet people
where they are.

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:02.937
(Laughter)

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:04.745
So before challenge week,

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:07.637
we were averaging two hours
a day on our phones

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.369
and 60 pickups,

00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:12.120
you know, like, a quick check,
did I get a new email?

00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:14.354
Here's what Tina, a student
at Bard College,

00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:15.890
discovered about herself.

00:07:16.732 --> 00:07:18.709
(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:22.195
between 150 and 200 minutes
on my phone per day,

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:25.786
and I've been picking up my phone
70 to 100 times per day.

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:28.044
And it's really concerning,

00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.502
because that's so much time
that I could have spent

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:34.378
doing something more productive,
more creative, more towards myself,

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:37.360
because when I'm on my phone,
I'm not doing anything important.

00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:40.729
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting
to observe their own behavior.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.327
They were getting ready
for challenge week.

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:45.125
And that Monday,

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.024
they started to wake up
to instructions in their inbox,

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:49.614
an experiment to try.

00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:51.616
Day one:

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.225
"Put it in your pocket."

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:55.541
Take that phone out of your hand.

00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.540
See if you can eliminate the reflex
to check it all day long,

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.058
just for a day.

00:08:00.082 --> 00:08:01.563
And if this sounds easy,

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:02.836
you haven't tried it.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.920
Here's listener Amanda Itzko.

00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:08.684
(Audio) Amanda Itzko:
I am absolutely itching.

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:11.164
I feel a little bit crazy,

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:15.872
because I have noticed
that I pick up my phone

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:19.804
when I'm just walking
from one room to another,

00:08:19.828 --> 00:08:21.094
getting on the elevator,

00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:24.895
and even -- and this is the part
that I am really embarrassed

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:26.906
to actually say out loud --

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.357
in the car.

00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:29.554
MZ: Yikes.

00:08:29.578 --> 00:08:31.247
Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned,

00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:34.654
this itching feeling
is not actually her fault.

00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:39.029
That is exactly the behavior
that the technology is built to trigger.

00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:41.961
(Laughter)

00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:45.783
I mean, right?

00:08:45.807 --> 00:08:48.699
Here's former Google designer,
Tristan Harris.

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:52.685
(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook
or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:54.567
I have literally a thousand engineers

00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:57.162
whose job is to get
more attention from you.

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:58.725
I'm very good at this,

00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:00.465
and I don't want you to ever stop.

00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:02.711
And you know, the CEO
of Netflix recently said,

00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:05.957
"Our biggest competitors
are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."

00:09:05.981 --> 00:09:09.255
I mean, so there's a million places
to spend your attention,

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.206
but there's a war going on to get it.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.928
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling:

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:15.081
that amazing episode
of "Transparent" ends,

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:16.857
and then the next one starts playing

00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:19.781
so you're like, eh, OK fine,
I'll just stay up and watch it.

00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:22.884
Or the LinkedIn progress bar
says you are this close

00:09:22.908 --> 00:09:25.064
to having the perfect profile,

00:09:25.088 --> 00:09:28.196
so you add a little more
personal information.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.214
As one UX designer told me,

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.511
the only people who refer
to their customers as "users"

00:09:33.535 --> 00:09:35.603
are drug dealers and technologists.

00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:36.983
(Laughter)

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:39.951
(Applause)

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.803
And users, as we know,
are worth a lot of money.

00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:50.237
Here's former Facebook
product manager and author,

00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.827
Antonio García Martínez.

00:09:53.547 --> 00:09:56.865
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez:
The saying is, if any product is free

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.490
then you're the product;
your attention is the product.

00:09:59.514 --> 00:10:01.088
But what is your attention worth?

00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:03.365
That's why literally every time
you load a page,

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:04.929
not just on Facebook or any app,

00:10:04.953 --> 00:10:08.024
there's an auction being held instantly,
billions of times a day,

00:10:08.048 --> 00:10:10.362
for exactly how much
that one ad impression cost.

00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:13.673
MZ: By the way, the average person
will spend two years of their life

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.855
on Facebook.

00:10:15.222 --> 00:10:16.764
So, back to challenge week.

00:10:16.788 --> 00:10:20.200
Immediately, we saw
some creativity kick in.

00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:21.970
Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.

00:10:22.773 --> 00:10:24.937
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:29.566
So I suddenly looked at the stairway
that went up to the top of the station,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.129
and I thought, you know,

00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:34.414
I had just come down that stairway,
but I could go back up

00:10:34.438 --> 00:10:36.923
and then come back down
and get a little cardio.

00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:38.111
So I did,

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:41.976
and then I had a little more time,
so I did it again and I did it again,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.806
and I did it 10 times.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.201
And I had a complete cardio workout.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.652
I got on that R train feeling
kind of exhausted,

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:51.340
but, like, wow,
that had never occurred to me.

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:52.759
How is that possible?

00:10:52.783 --> 00:10:53.887
(Laughter)

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.897
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means
different things to different people.

00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:58.921
(Laughter)

00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:02.498
But everyone found
day three's challenge the hardest.

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:04.738
It was called "Delete that app."

00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:06.639
Take that app -- you know the one;

00:11:06.663 --> 00:11:09.439
that one that always gets you,
it sucks you in --

00:11:09.463 --> 00:11:10.626
take it off your phone,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.038
even if just for the day.

00:11:12.062 --> 00:11:15.324
I deleted the game Two Dots
and nearly cried.

00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:16.394
(Laughter)

00:11:16.418 --> 00:11:18.837
Yeah, Two Dots players
know what I'm talking about.

00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:21.377
But my misery had good company.

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:26.626
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam
in Los Angeles,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.483
and I deleted Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine

00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:32.662
from my phone

00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:34.287
in one fell swoop.

00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:38.952
And it was kind of an embarrassingly
emotional experience at first.

00:11:38.976 --> 00:11:42.848
It felt weirdly lonely
to look at that lock screen

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:45.229
with no new notifications on it.

00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:48.301
But I really liked deciding for myself

00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:51.717
when to think about or access
my social networks,

00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:55.107
not giving my phone the power
to decide that for me.

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:56.917
So thank you.

00:11:56.941 --> 00:11:59.632
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app
was very sad,

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:03.194
and I feel I maybe, over the last year
when I've been on Twitter,

00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:04.838
have developed an addiction to it,

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:08.250
and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge
has really made me realize it.

00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:11.406
After a brief period of really horrible
withdrawal feeling,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.399
like lack-of-caffeine headache,

00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:14.999
I now feel lovely.

00:12:15.023 --> 00:12:16.834
I had a lovely dinner with my family,

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:21.533
and I hope to continue this structured use
of these powerful tools.

00:12:21.557 --> 00:12:24.056
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have
that guilty gut feeling

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.375
I have when I know
I'm wasting time on my phone.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.901
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself
challenges and reminders like this

00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:31.077
every morning.

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:32.794
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:35.285
I could not wait to see
what the numbers said

00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:36.973
at the end of that week.

00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:40.054
But when the data came in,

00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:42.351
it turned out that we had cut down,

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:43.613
on average,

00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.903
just six minutes --

00:12:45.927 --> 00:12:48.737
from 120 minutes a day on our phones

00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:50.598
to 114.

00:12:51.654 --> 00:12:53.273
Yeah. Whoop-de-do.

00:12:53.297 --> 00:12:57.007
So I went back to the scientists
feeling kind of low,

00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:58.511
and they just laughed at me,

00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:00.966
and they said, you know,
changing people's behavior

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.523
in such a short time period

00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:04.774
was ridiculously ambitious,

00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:10.017
and actually what you've achieved
is far beyond what we thought possible.

00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:13.877
Because more important than the numbers,
were the people's stories.

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.543
They felt empowered.

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:18.206
Their phones had been transformed

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.959
from taskmasters

00:13:19.983 --> 00:13:21.605
back into tools.

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:26.658
And actually, I found what
the young people said most intriguing.

00:13:26.682 --> 00:13:27.837
Some of them told me

00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:30.123
that they didn't recognize
some of the emotions

00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:31.942
that they felt during challenge week,

00:13:31.966 --> 00:13:33.453
because, if you think about it,

00:13:33.477 --> 00:13:36.441
if you have never known life
without connectivity,

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:38.894
you may never have experienced boredom.

00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:41.537
And there could be consequences.

00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:44.990
Researchers at USC have found --
they're studying teenagers

00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:47.974
who are on social media
while they're talking to their friends

00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:49.284
or they're doing homework,

00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:53.123
and two years down the road,
they are less creative and imaginative

00:13:53.147 --> 00:13:55.001
about their own personal futures

00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:59.238
and about solving societal problems,
like violence in their neighborhoods.

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:02.296
And we really need this next generation

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.546
to be able to focus on some big problems:

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.014
climate change, economic disparity,

00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:09.075
massive cultural differences.

00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:12.383
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey

00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:17.020
identified creativity as the number one
leadership competency.

00:14:18.214 --> 00:14:19.882
OK, here's the good news, though:

00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:23.677
In the end, 20,000 people
did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:26.133
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.027
Seventy percent got more time to think.

00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:31.180
People told me that they slept better.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.521
They felt happier.

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:36.169
My favorite note was from a guy
who said he felt like he was waking up

00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:38.372
from a mental hibernation.

00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:42.585
Some personal data and some neuroscience

00:14:42.609 --> 00:14:45.750
gave us permission
to be offline a little bit more,

00:14:45.774 --> 00:14:48.717
and a little bit of boredom
gave us some clarity

00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:51.060
and helped some of us set some goals.

00:14:52.156 --> 00:14:54.267
I mean, maybe constant connectivity

00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:56.937
won't be cool in a couple of years.

00:14:58.073 --> 00:15:01.631
But meanwhile, teaching people,
especially kids,

00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:04.782
how to use technology
to improve their lives

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:06.221
and to self-regulate

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:08.820
needs to be part of digital literacy.

00:15:10.685 --> 00:15:12.992
So the next time you go
to check your phone,

00:15:13.632 --> 00:15:17.704
remember that if you don't decide
how you're going to use the technology,

00:15:17.728 --> 00:15:20.046
the platforms will decide for you.

00:15:21.013 --> 00:15:22.594
And ask yourself:

00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:24.356
What am I really looking for?

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.075
Because if it's to check email,
that's fine -- do it and be done.

00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:30.767
But if it's to distract yourself
from doing the hard work

00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.091
that comes with deeper thinking,

00:15:33.115 --> 00:15:34.523
take a break,

00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:35.945
stare out the window

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:39.512
and know that by doing nothing

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:44.238
you are actually being
your most productive and creative self.

00:15:44.262 --> 00:15:46.985
It might feel weird
and uncomfortable at first,

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:49.895
but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.

00:15:50.394 --> 00:15:51.546
Thank you.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.357
(Applause)
