00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.836
It's 1878.

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:08.247
Sir Francis Galton
gives a remarkable talk.

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:13.456
He's speaking to the anthropologic
institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.196
Known for his pioneering work
in human intelligence,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.208
Galton is a brilliant polymath.

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:23.270
He's an explorer,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.047
an anthropologist,

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:26.601
a sociologist,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.194
a psychologist

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:29.692
and a statistician.

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:33.669
He's also a eugenist.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.846
In this talk,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:41.560
he presents a new technique
by which he can combine photographs

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:43.843
and produce composite portraits.

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:49.677
This technique could be used
to characterize different types of people.

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:56.051
Galton thinks that if he combines
photographs of violent criminals,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.201
he will discover the face of criminality.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:02.240
But to his surprise,

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.128
the composite portrait that he produces

00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.207
is beautiful.

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:13.054
Galton's surprising finding
raises deep questions:

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.100
What is beauty?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.889
Why do certain configurations of line
and color and form excite us so?

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:25.900
For most of human history,

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:31.479
these questions have been approached
using logic and speculation.

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:33.632
But in the last few decades,

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.534
scientists have addressed
the question of beauty

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:41.627
using ideas from evolutionary psychology
and tools of neuroscience.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:46.365
We're beginning to glimpse
the why and the how of beauty,

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:50.269
at least in terms of what it means
for the human face and form.

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.757
And in the process,

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:55.133
we're stumbling upon some surprises.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.968
When it comes to seeing
beauty in each other,

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.104
while this decision is certainly
subjective for the individual,

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:08.311
it's sculpted by factors that contribute
to the survival of the group.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.458
Many experiments have shown

00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:15.483
that a few basic parameters contribute
to what makes a face attractive.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:21.991
These include averaging, symmetry
and the effects of hormones.

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:24.425
Let's take each one of these in turn.

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.005
Galton's finding

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:33.312
that composite or average faces
are typically more attractive

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:36.893
than each individual face
that contributes to the average

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.846
has been replicated many times.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:44.122
This laboratory finding fits
with many people's intuitions.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:48.965
Average faces represent
the central tendencies of a group.

00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:54.043
People with mixed features
represent different populations,

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:57.415
and presumably harbor
greater genetic diversity

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.637
and adaptability to the environment.

00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:04.741
Many people find mixed-race
individuals attractive

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.939
and inbred families less so.

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:12.810
The second factor that contributes
to beauty is symmetry.

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:17.800
People generally find symmetric faces
more attractive than asymmetric ones.

00:03:18.758 --> 00:03:24.010
Developmental abnormalities
are often associated with asymmetries.

00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:27.299
And in plants, animals and humans,

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.629
asymmetries often arise
from parasitic infections.

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:33.591
Symmetry, it turns out,

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:37.118
is also an indicator of health.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.063
In the 1930s,

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.679
a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:46.880
recognized the importance
of symmetry for beauty

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:49.059
when he designed the beauty micrometer.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.448
With this device,

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:54.527
he could measure minor asymmetric flaws

00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:59.100
which he could then make up for
with products he sold from his company,

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:02.948
named brilliantly
after himself, Max Factor,

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:05.983
which, as you know,
is one of the world's most famous brands

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:07.175
for "make up."

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:12.473
The third factor that contributes
to facial attractiveness

00:04:12.497 --> 00:04:14.210
is the effect of hormones.

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:19.587
And here, I need to apologize
for confining my comments

00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:21.849
to heterosexual norms.

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:28.088
But estrogen and testosterone
play important roles

00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:30.710
in shaping features
that we find attractive.

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:35.500
Estrogen produces features
that signal fertility.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:39.284
Men typically find women attractive

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:43.609
who have elements
of both youth and maturity.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:48.156
A face that's too baby-like might
mean that the girl is not yet fertile,

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:51.092
so men find women attractive

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:55.352
who have large eyes,
full lips and narrow chins

00:04:55.376 --> 00:04:56.885
as indicators of youth,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.083
and high cheekbones
as an indicator of maturity.

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:07.847
Testosterone produces features
that we regard as typically masculine.

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:10.797
These include heavier brows,

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.126
thinner cheeks

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.402
and bigger, squared-off jaws.

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.216
But here's a fascinating irony.

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:18.846
In many species,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.251
if anything,

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:23.967
testosterone suppresses the immune system.

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:29.176
So the idea that testosterone-infused
features are a fitness indicator

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.425
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:34.682
Here, the logic is turned on its head.

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:37.807
Instead of a fitness indicator,

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:41.238
scientists invoke a handicap principle.

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.321
The most commonly cited
example of a handicap

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:47.836
is the peacock's tail.

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:52.938
This beautiful but cumbersome tail
doesn't exactly help the peacock

00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:54.224
avoid predators

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.367
and approach peahens.

00:05:57.188 --> 00:06:00.640
Why should such an extravagant
appendage evolve?

00:06:01.947 --> 00:06:03.542
Even Charles Darwin,

00:06:04.408 --> 00:06:07.807
in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:11.603
that the sight of the peacock's tail
made him physically ill.

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:15.042
He couldn't explain it
with his theory of natural selection,

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:16.965
and out of this frustration,

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:20.173
he developed the theory
of sexual selection.

00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.651
On this account,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:27.058
the display of the peacock's tail
is about sexual enticement,

00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:33.304
and this enticement means
it's more likely the peacock will mate

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:34.662
and have offspring.

00:06:35.818 --> 00:06:38.807
Now, the modern twist
on this display argument

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:44.442
is that the peacock is also
advertising its health to the peahen.

00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:51.128
Only especially fit organisms
can afford to divert resources

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:53.850
to maintaining such
an extravagant appendage.

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:59.485
Only especially fit men can afford
the price that testosterone levies

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.778
on their immune system.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.218
And by analogy, think of the fact

00:07:04.242 --> 00:07:11.207
that only very rich men can afford
to pay more than $10,000 for a watch

00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:13.481
as a display of their financial fitness.

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:17.915
Now, many people hear these kinds
of evolutionary claims

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.669
and think they mean that we somehow
are unconsciously seeking mates

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.608
who are healthy.

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:28.575
And I think this idea
is probably not right.

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:35.131
Teenagers and young adults are not exactly
known for making decisions

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:37.343
that are predicated on health concerns.

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.145
But they don't have to be,

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.652
and let me explain why.

00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:44.502
Imagine a population

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:49.386
in which people have three different
kinds of preferences:

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.735
for green, for orange and for red.

00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:55.113
From their point of view,

00:07:55.137 --> 00:07:57.500
these preferences have
nothing to do with health;

00:07:57.524 --> 00:07:59.016
they just like what they like.

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:04.169
But if it were also the case
that these preferences are associated

00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:07.191
with the different likelihood
of producing offspring --

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:10.077
let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 --

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.504
then in the first generation,

00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:15.800
there would be 3 greens
to 2 oranges to 1 red,

00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:18.010
and in each subsequent generation,

00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:20.740
the proportion of greens increase,

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:23.778
so that in 10 generations,

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:27.575
98 percent of this population
has a green preference.

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:31.084
Now, a scientist coming in
and sampling this population

00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:34.757
discovers that green
preferences are universal.

00:08:35.606 --> 00:08:39.478
So the point about this little
abstract example

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:44.162
is that while preferences
for specific physical features

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:46.749
can be arbitrary for the individual,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.860
if those features are heritable

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.391
and they are associated
with a reproductive advantage,

00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:58.629
over time,

00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.580
they become universal for the group.

00:09:03.172 --> 00:09:08.373
So what happens in the brain
when we see beautiful people?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.548
Attractive faces activate
parts of our visual cortex

00:09:14.572 --> 00:09:16.517
in the back of the brain,

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.483
an area called the fusiform gyrus,

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:21.309
that is especially tuned
to processing faces,

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:25.347
and an adjacent area called
the lateral occipital complex,

00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:28.127
that is especially attuned
to processing objects.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.096
In addition,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.198
attractive faces activate parts
of our reward and pleasure centers

00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:37.487
in the front and deep in the brain,

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:41.303
and these include areas
that have complicated names,

00:09:41.327 --> 00:09:43.191
like the ventral striatum,

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.134
the orbitofrontal cortex

00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:47.752
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

00:09:48.732 --> 00:09:52.716
Our visual brain that is tuned
to processing faces

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.377
interacts with our pleasure centers

00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:57.848
to underpin the experience of beauty.

00:09:59.719 --> 00:10:03.811
Amazingly, while we all
engage with beauty,

00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:05.432
without our knowledge,

00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:07.214
beauty also engages us.

00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:10.977
Our brains respond to attractive faces

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.355
even when we're not thinking about beauty.

00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:18.926
We conducted an experiment
in which people saw a series of faces,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.653
and in one condition,

00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:26.253
they had to decide if a pair of faces
were the same or a different person.

00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:30.400
Even in this condition,

00:10:30.424 --> 00:10:36.566
attractive faces drove neural activity
robustly in their visual cortex,

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.103
despite the fact that they were thinking
about a person's identity

00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:41.428
and not their beauty.

00:10:43.127 --> 00:10:47.438
Another group similarly found
automatic responses to beauty

00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:49.625
within our pleasure centers.

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.340
Taken together, these studies suggest

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:58.544
that our brain automatically
responds to beauty

00:10:58.568 --> 00:11:00.583
by linking vision and pleasure.

00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:04.234
These beauty detectors, it seems,

00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:06.096
ping every time we see beauty,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.814
regardless of whatever else
we might be thinking.

00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:16.511
We also have a "beauty is good"
stereotype embedded in the brain.

00:11:17.712 --> 00:11:19.939
Within the orbitofrontal cortex,

00:11:19.963 --> 00:11:21.738
there's overlapping neural activity

00:11:21.762 --> 00:11:25.546
in response to beauty and to goodness,

00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:30.707
and this happens even when people
aren't explicitly thinking

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.334
about beauty or goodness.

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:37.865
Our brains seem to reflexively
associate beauty and good.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.668
And this reflexive association
may be the biologic trigger

00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:45.374
for the many social effects of beauty.

00:11:46.057 --> 00:11:50.451
Attractive people receive
all kinds of advantages in life.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.310
They're regarded as more intelligent,

00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:55.937
more trustworthy,

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.506
they're given higher pay
and lesser punishments,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.252
even when such judgments
are not warranted.

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:06.912
These kinds of observations
reveal beauty's ugly side.

00:12:07.796 --> 00:12:09.869
In my lab, we recently found

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:14.815
that people with minor facial
anomalies and disfigurements

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:18.623
are regarded as less good, less kind,

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:23.078
less intelligent, less competent
and less hardworking.

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:29.138
Unfortunately, we also have
a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.

00:12:30.398 --> 00:12:37.056
This stereotype is probably
exploited and magnified

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.493
by images in popular media,

00:12:39.517 --> 00:12:43.413
in which facial disfigurement
is often used as a shorthand

00:12:43.437 --> 00:12:46.095
to depict someone of villainous character.

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.832
We need to understand
these kinds of implicit biases

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:52.593
if we are to overcome them

00:12:52.617 --> 00:12:56.298
and aim for a society
in which we treat people fairly,

00:12:56.322 --> 00:13:00.737
based on their behavior and not
on the happenstance of their looks.

00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:08.003
Let me leave you with one final thought.

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.092
Beauty is a work in progress.

00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:15.734
The so-called universal
attributes of beauty

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:21.246
were selected for during the almost
two million years of the Pleistocene.

00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:26.836
Life was nasty, brutish
and a very long time ago.

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:33.338
The selection criteria
for reproductive success from that time

00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:35.227
doesn't really apply today.

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:37.456
For example,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.547
death by parasite is not one
of the top ways that people die,

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.462
at least not in the technologically
developed world.

00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:48.357
From antibiotics to surgery,

00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:51.873
birth control to in vitro fertilization,

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:55.287
the filters for reproductive success
are being relaxed.

00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:58.611
And under these relaxed conditions,

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:02.869
preference and trait combinations
are free to drift

00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:04.662
and become more variable.

00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:09.602
Even as we are profoundly
affecting our environment,

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:14.298
modern medicine
and technological innovation

00:14:14.322 --> 00:14:16.075
is profoundly affecting

00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:19.821
the very essence of what it means
to look beautiful.

00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.747
The universal nature of beauty is changing

00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:26.692
even as we're changing the universe.

00:14:28.863 --> 00:14:30.048
Thank you.

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:33.658
