00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:02.698
So, I'm afraid.

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:05.072
Right now,

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.617
on this stage,

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:07.859
I feel fear.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.802
In my life, I ain't met many people

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:13.056
that will readily admit
when they are afraid.

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:15.641
And I think that's because deep down,

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.373
they know how easy it spreads.

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:20.023
See, fear is like a disease.

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:23.200
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:25.490
But what happens when,

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.264
even in the face of that fear,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:28.775
you do what you've got to do?

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:30.623
That's called courage.

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:33.037
And just like fear,

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.443
courage is contagious.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.118
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:39.302
That's a small city

00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:42.141
across the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, Missouri.

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:46.238
I have lived in and around
St. Louis my entire life.

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:49.747
When Michael Brown, Jr.,

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.023
an ordinary teenager,

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:55.597
was gunned down by police in 2014
in Ferguson, Missouri --

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.780
another suburb, but north of St. Louis --

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.337
I remember thinking,

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.120
he ain't the first,

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:06.008
and he won't be the last young kid
to lose his life to law enforcement.

00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:08.149
But see, his death was different.

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:10.388
When Mike was killed,

00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:13.876
I remember the powers that be
trying to use fear as a weapon.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.708
The police response to a community
in mourning was to use force

00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:19.955
to impose fear:

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:22.362
fear of militarized police,

00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:24.142
imprisonment,

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.335
fines.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.879
The media even tried
to make us afraid of each other

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:29.455
by the way they spun the story.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.838
And all of these things
have worked in the past.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.476
But like I said,
this time it was different.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:39.038
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent
treatment of the community

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:42.799
led to a string of protests in and around
Ferguson and St. Louis.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.325
When I got out to those protests
about the fourth or fifth day,

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:48.752
it was not out of courage;

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.679
it was out of guilt.

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:52.768
See, I'm black.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:54.968
I don't know if y'all noticed that.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.017
(Laughter)

00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:01.518
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,
minutes away from Ferguson,

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:03.011
and not go see.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.477
So I got off my ass to go check it out.

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:06.941
When I got out there,

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.374
I found something surprising.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.688
I found anger; there was a lot of that.

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:15.779
But what I found more of was love.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:18.653
People with love for themselves.

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.317
Love for their community.

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.030
And it was beautiful --

00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:23.643
until the police showed up.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:28.414
Then a new emotion was interjected
into the conversation:

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.198
fear.

00:02:30.627 --> 00:02:32.312
Now, I'm not going to lie;

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.130
when I saw those armored vehicles,

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.315
and all that gear

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.705
and all those guns

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.490
and all those police

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:40.977
I was terrified --

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.176
personally.

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.725
And when I looked around that crowd,

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.511
I saw a lot of people that had
the same thing going on.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.728
But I also saw people
with something else inside of them.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.823
That was courage.

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:55.225
See, those people yelled,

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.491
and they screamed,

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:59.067
and they were not about
to back down from the police.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:00.739
They were past that point.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:03.014
And then I could feel
something in me changing,

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:04.676
so I yelled and I screamed,

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.977
and I noticed that everybody around me
was doing the same thing.

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:12.014
And there was nothing like that feeling.

00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:15.110
So I decided I wanted
to do something more.

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.909
I went home, I thought:
I'm an artist. I make shit.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:22.560
So I started making things
specific to the protest,

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:26.681
things that would be weapons
in a spiritual war,

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.364
things that would give people voice

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.120
and things that would fortify them
for the road ahead.

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:38.467
I did a project where I took pictures
of the hands of protesters

00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:42.480
and put them up and down
the boarded-up buildings

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:44.180
and community shops.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.490
My goal was to raise awareness
and to raise the morale.

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:50.915
And I think, for a minute at least,

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.185
it did just that.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.490
Then I thought, I want to uplift
the stories of these people

00:03:57.514 --> 00:03:59.920
I was watching being
courageous in the moment.

00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:03.509
And myself and my friend,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.102
and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.304
did just that with our documentary,

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:09.639
"Whose Streets?"

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.608
I kind of became a conduit

00:04:13.632 --> 00:04:17.154
for all of this courage
that was given to me.

00:04:17.178 --> 00:04:20.367
And I think that's part
of our job as artists.

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:24.781
I think we should be conveyors
of courage in the work that we do.

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:29.616
And I think that we are the wall
between the normal folks

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.096
and the people that use their power
to spread fear and hate,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.864
especially in times like these.

00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:38.238
So I'm going to ask you.

00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:40.040
Y'all the movers and the shakers,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.604
you know, the thought leaders:

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:44.468
What are you gonna do

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.515
with the gifts that you've been given

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.980
to break us from the fear
the binds us every day?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.539
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:54.440
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:58.746
But once I figured out that fear
was not put in me to cripple me,

00:04:59.573 --> 00:05:01.225
it was there to protect me,

00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:04.132
and once I figured out
how to use that fear,

00:05:04.824 --> 00:05:06.189
I found my power.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.302
Thank you.

00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:10.928
(Applause)
