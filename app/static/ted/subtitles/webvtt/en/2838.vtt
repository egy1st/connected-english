00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:02.150
Hi everyone.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.440
So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.176
I'd just spent about six months
working on album

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.256
that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.496
and it was getting about three plays
per day on Myspace at the time,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.536
and I was getting more and more depressed
when I started noticing these other people

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.256
who were playing guitar and singing

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.696
and putting videos
on this new site called YouTube,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.456
and they were getting 300,000 views.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.576
So I decided I'm going to start
making some Youtube videos.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.816
And one day they featured
a video of my band on the homepage,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.095
which was amazing --
we got a bunch of new fans.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.536
We also got a bunch of people

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.536
who, I guess, just didn't really like
the music or something --

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.576
(Laughter)

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.016
It's OK because people
started coming to our shows,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.296
and we started touring,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.776
and we came out with a record.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.856
And when I checked
our bank account balance

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.736
after our first monthly iTunes payout,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.256
we had 22,000 bucks in it,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.536
which was amazing because at the time
I was living at my dad's house,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.016
trying to make a living as a musician
by uploading videos to the internet

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.856
which literally zero people
respected in 2009 --

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.616
even the people who were
uploading videos to the internet.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.336
And so for the next four years,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.176
I uploaded more and more
videos to the Internet,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.736
and they got better and better,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.936
and we made enough money
through brand deals

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.496
and commercials and iTunes sales

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.336
to buy a house.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.656
And we built a recording studio.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.336
But there was one big problem:

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.456
making money as a creative person
in 2013 was super weird.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.376
First of all, the business models
were changing all the time.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.176
So our 58,000 dollars
of annual iTunes download income

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.856
was about to be replaced by about
6,000 dollars of streaming income.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.776
Steams paid less than downloads.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.856
And then as more and more creators
started popping up online,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.976
there was just more competition
for these five-figure brand deals

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.136
that had kept the band afloat for years.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.376
And to top it all off,
our videos themselves --

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.216
the creative stuff that we made
that our fans loved and appreciated --

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.696
that were actually
contributing value to the world,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.856
those videos were generating
almost zero dollars of income for us.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.256
This is an actual snapshot
of my YouTube dashboard

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.536
from a 28-day period

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.256
that shows one million views

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.840
and 166 dollars of ad earnings
for those views.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.175
The whole machine in 2013

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.696
that took art online and outputted money

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.016
was totally nonfunctional.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.576
It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.216
or an institution,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.576
or an independent creator.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.896
A monthly web comic
with 20,000 monthly readers --

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.216
20,000 monthly readers --

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.576
gets paid a couple hundred
bucks in ad revenue.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.640
This is 20,000 people.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.296
Like, in what world is this not enough?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.256
I don't understand.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.896
What systems have we built
where this is insufficient

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.400
for a person to make a living?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.896
So, I actually have a theory about this.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.656
I think it's been a weird 100 years.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.896
(Laughter)

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.976
(Applause)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.896
About 100 years ago,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.496
humans figured out how to record
sound onto a wax cylinder.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.496
That was the beginning of the phonograph.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.856
Right around the same time,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.176
we figured out how to record
light onto a piece of photographic paper,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.576
celluloid -- the beginning
of film and television.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.296
For the first time,
you could store art on a thing,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.576
which was amazing.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.336
Art used to be completely ephemeral,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.816
so if you missed the symphony,
you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.256
But now, for the first time,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.856
you could store the orchestra's
performance on a physical object,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.376
and like, listen to it later,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.136
which was amazing.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.416
It was so amazing in fact,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.736
that for the next 100 years,
between 1900 and 2000,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.256
humans built just billions and billions
of dollars of infrastructure

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.536
to essentially help artists do two things.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.616
First, put their art on a thing,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.856
and second, get that thing
around the world

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.496
to the people who wanted the art.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.336
So, so much industry
is devoted to these two problems.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.313
Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:50.016
and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms,
and CD jewel case manufacturers,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.040
all devoted to these two problems.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.176
And then we all know what happened.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.856
10 years ago, the internet matures

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.936
and we get Spotify
and Facebook and YouTube

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.776
and iTunes and Google search,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.856
and a hundred years of infrastructure

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.456
and supply chains and distribution systems

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.296
and monetization schemes

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.216
are completely bypassed --

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.440
in a decade.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.376
After 100 years of designing these things,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.296
it's no wonder that it's just totally
broken for creative people right now.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.936
It's no wonder that the monetization
part of the chain doesn't work

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.480
given this new context.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.176
But what gets me super excited
to be a creator right now,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.136
to be alive today and be
a creative person right now,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.336
is realizing that we're only 10 years
into figuring out this new machine --

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.376
to figuring out the next 100 years
of infrastructure for our creators.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.336
And you can tell we're only 10 years in.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.456
There's a lot of trial and error,
some really good ideas forming,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.736
a lot of experimentation.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.976
We're figuring out
what works and what doesn't.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.136
Like Twitch streamers.
Who's heard of Twitch?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.576
Twitch streamers are making
three to five thousand bucks a month

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.856
streaming gaming content.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.160
The big ones are making
over 100,000 dollars a year.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.976
There's a site called YouNow,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.216
it's an app.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.016
It allows musicians and vloggers
to get paid in digital goods from fans.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.776
So, I'm also working on the problem.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.136
Four years ago I started
a company called Patreon

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.416
with a friend of mine.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.840
We're 80 people now
working on this problem.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.696
It's basically a membership platform

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.936
that makes it really easy
for creators to get paid --

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.176
every month from their fans
to earn a living.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.456
For a creator, it's like having a salary
for being a creative person.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.056
And this is one of our creators.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.496
They're called "Kinda Funny."

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.776
They have about 220,000
subscribers on YouTube.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.216
And when they upload a video,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.016
it gets somewhere around
15,000 views to 100,000 views.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.016
I want you to check yourselves right now.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.256
I think when we hear numbers like that,
when we hear "15,000 views,"

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.696
and we see content like this,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.896
we just snap categorize it
as being not as legitimate

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.896
as a morning show
that you'd hear on the radio

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.296
or a talk show that you'd
see on NBC or something

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.456
But when "Kinda Funny"
launched on Patreon,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.736
within a few weeks, they were
making 31,000 dollars per month

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.256
for this show.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.376
It took off so fast that they decided
to expand their programming

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.656
and add new shows,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.336
and now they launched
a second Patreon page --

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.480
they're making an additional
21,000 dollars per month.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.840
And they're scaling what's essentially
becoming a media company,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.920
financing the whole thing
through membership.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.136
OK, here's another example.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.496
This is Derek Bodner,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.496
a sports journalist who used
to write for Philadelphia Magazine

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.776
until a few months ago when
the magazine cut out all sports coverage.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.776
Now he writes articles
and publishes them on his own website --

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.896
he's still covering sports,
but for himself.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.776
And he's making 4,800 bucks
a month from 1,700 patrons,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.776
financing it through membership.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.056
This is Crash Course --

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.200
free educational content for the world.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.016
This show is actually
on the PBS digital network --

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.376
29,000 dollars per month.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.616
This is a duo sailing around the world,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.216
getting paid every month
for documenting their travels

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.736
from 1,400 patrons.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.296
This is a podcast,
"Chapo Trap House", making --

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.176
actually, since I screenshotted this,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.696
they're making an additional
2,000 dollars per month,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.320
so they're now making 56,000 dollars
per month for their podcast.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.776
And Patreon's not the only one
working on the problem.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.696
Even Google's starting to work on this.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.896
A couple years ago,
they launched Fan Funding;

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.816
more recently, they launched Super Chat

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.216
as a way for creators
to monetize live streaming.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.816
Newspapers are starting
to experiment with membership.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.776
New York Times has a membership program;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.056
The Guardian has over 200,000
paying subscribers

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.320
to its membership program.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.296
There's this bubbling soup
of ideas and experiments

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.816
and progress right now,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.680
and it's pointing in the direction
of getting creators paid.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.776
And it's working.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.376
It's not, like, perfect yet,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.856
but it's really working.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.736
So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators
on the platform making salaries --

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.816
getting paid every month
for putting art online,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.176
for being a creative person.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.656
The next hundred years
of infrastructure is on the way

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.456
and it's going to be different
this time because of this --

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.856
because of the direct connection
between the person who makes the thing

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.560
and the person who likes the thing.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.576
About seven or eight years ago,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600
I went to a cocktail party.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.096
This is when the band
had hit our first machine,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.616
so things were really cranking.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.016
We had just made
about 400,000 dollars in one year

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.736
through iTunes sales
and brand deals and stuff like that.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.560
And this guy comes up to me and says,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.896
"Hey, Jack, what do you do?"

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.400
I said, "I'm a musician."

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.376
And he just sobered up immediately,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.416
and he stuck out his hand,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.696
put a hand on my shoulder,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.456
and in a real earnest,
very nice voice he was like,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.861
"I hope you make it someday."

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.765
(Laughter)

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.080
And ...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.296
I have so many moments like that
logged in my memory.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.176
I just cringe thinking of that.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.880
It's so embarrassing to just
not feel valued as a creative person.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.736
But as a species,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.176
we are leaving that cocktail party behind.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.336
We're leaving that culture,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.560
we're out of there.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.896
We're going to get so good
at paying creators,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.160
within 10 years,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.976
kids graduating high school and college
are going to think of being a creator

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.256
as just being an option --

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.233
I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,

00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:21.576
I could be a podcaster,
I could have a web comic.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.656
It's just going to be
something you can do.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.920
We're figuring it out.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.040
It's going to be a viable and sustainable
and respected profession.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.016
Creators are going to come out
the other end of this weird 100 years,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.560
this century-long journey,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.280
with an awesome new machine.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.720
And they're going to be paid,
and they're going to be valued.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.976
Thanks, everybody.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.160
(Applause)

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.480
I think it went pretty well.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.136
I want artists who saw that
to not give up --

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.696
to know that we're getting there.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.336
It's not there yet,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600
but in a couple years,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.576
there will be so many systems
and tools for them

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.576
to just make a living online,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.896
and if they've got a podcast
that's starting to take off,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.056
but they're not able
to make money on it yet,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.296
that's happening

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.736
and they're going to be paid.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.960
It's happening.
