WEBVTT

00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.656
So, let me add to the complexity

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.246
of the situation we find ourselves in.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.596
At the same time that we're solving
for climate change,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.423
we're going to be building cities
for three billion people.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.185
That's a doubling
of the urban environment.

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:19.580
If we don't get that right,

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:24.135
I'm not sure all the climate solutions
in the world will save mankind,

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:28.582
because so much depends
on how we shape our cities:

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:30.836
not just environmental impacts,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.496
but our social well-being,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.802
our economic vitality,

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.625
our sense of community and connectedness.

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:41.325
Fundamentally, the way we shape cities
is a manifestation

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:44.008
of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:47.142
And so getting it right is, I think,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.812
the order of the day.

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:52.464
And to a certain degree, getting it right
can help us solve climate change,

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:53.640
because in the end,

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:57.092
it's our behavior that seems
to be driving the problem.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:58.994
The problem isn't free-floating,

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.924
and it isn't just ExxonMobil
and oil companies.

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.661
It's us; how we live.

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:07.560
How we live.

00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:09.609
There's a villain in this story.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.146
It's called sprawl,
and I'll be upfront about that.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.955
But it's not just the kind of sprawl
you think of, or many people think of,

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.609
as low-density development

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.281
out at the periphery
of the metropolitan area.

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:26.652
Actually, I think sprawl can happen
anywhere, at any density.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.497
The key attribute
is that it isolates people.

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:34.944
It segregates people
into economic enclaves

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:36.560
and land-use enclaves.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:38.680
It separates them from nature.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.858
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.146
the interaction,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.593
that make cities great places

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.863
and that make society thrive.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.131
So the antidote to sprawl is really
what we all need to be thinking about,

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:57.578
especially when we're taking on
this massive construction project.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.590
So let me take you through one exercise.

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:04.380
We developed the model
for the state of California

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.487
so they could get on
with reducing carbon emissions.

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:13.542
We did a whole series of scenarios
for how the state could grow,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.689
and this is just one
overly simplified one.

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.509
We mixed different development prototypes

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:23.344
and said they're going to carry us
through the year 2050,

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:28.124
10 million new crew
in our state of California.

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:29.943
And one was sprawl.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.499
It's just more of the same:
shopping malls, subdivisions,

00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:34.707
office parks.

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.521
The other one was dominated by,
not everybody moving to the city,

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:40.228
but just compact development,

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:42.810
what we used to think of
as streetcar suburbs,

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.073
walkable neighborhoods,

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.362
low-rise, but integrated,
mixed-used environments.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.405
And the results are astounding.

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.592
They're astounding not just
for the scale of the difference

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:58.851
of this one shift
in our city-making habit

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:03.589
but also because each one represents
a special interest group,

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.622
a special interest group
that used to advocate for their concerns

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:09.811
one at a time.

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:14.934
They did not see the, what I call,
"co-benefits" of urban form

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.433
that allows them to join with others.

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:19.045
So, land consumption:

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.883
environmentalists are really
concerned about this,

00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:23.092
so are farmers;

00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:25.918
there's a whole range of people,

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:29.329
and, of course, neighborhood groups
that want open space nearby.

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.947
The sprawl version of California

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:35.597
almost doubles the urban
physical footprint.

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.104
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:43.943
because in California, our biggest
carbon emission comes from cars,

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:47.667
and cities that don't depend
on cars as much

00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:50.738
obviously create huge savings.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:54.677
Vehicle miles traveled:
that's what I was just talking about.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:59.686
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles
per household per year,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.040
from somewhere
in the mid-26,000 per household,

00:04:05.064 --> 00:04:09.944
has a huge impact
not just on air quality and carbon

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:12.539
but also on the household pocketbook.

00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:15.556
It's very expensive to drive that much,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.972
and as we've seen,

00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:19.511
the middle class is struggling to hold on.

00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:24.298
Health care: we were talking about
how do you fix it once we broke it --

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:25.481
clean the air.

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.496
Why not just stop polluting?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.948
Why not just use our feet and bikes more?

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:34.163
And that's a function of the kinds
of cities that we shape.

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:36.706
Household costs:

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.541
2008 was a mark in time,

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:43.127
not of just the financial
industry running amok.

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:48.302
It was that we were trying to sell
too many of the wrong kind of housing:

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:51.277
large lot, single family, distant,

00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:55.502
too expensive for the average
middle-class family to afford

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:59.128
and, quite frankly, not a good fit
to their lifestyle anymore.

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:01.068
But in order to move inventory,

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:04.672
you can discount the financing
and get it sold.

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:06.544
I think that's a lot of what happened.

00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:09.234
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:12.095
remember, in California
the median is 50,000 --

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.000
this is a big element.

00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:16.653
That's just cars and utility costs.

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:20.877
So the affordable housing advocates,
who often sit off in their silos

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:25.365
separate from the environmentalists,
separate from the politicians,

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.367
everybody fighting with everyone,

00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.309
now begin to see common cause,

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.769
and I think the common cause
is what really brings about the change.

00:05:33.837 --> 00:05:36.717
Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,

00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:39.765
has now decided to transform itself

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.161
into a more transit-oriented environment.

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.919
As a matter of fact, since '08,

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:48.892
they've voted in 400 billion dollars
of bonds for transit

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:51.765
and zero dollars for new highways.

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:52.957
What a transformation:

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.312
LA becomes a city of walkers and transit,

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:57.515
not a city of cars.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:58.546
(Applause)

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.770
How does it happen?

00:05:59.794 --> 00:06:01.931
You take the least
desirable land, the strip,

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.002
you add where there's space, transit

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:08.289
and then you infill mixed-use development,

00:06:08.313 --> 00:06:10.496
you satisfy new housing demands

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.511
and you make the existing neighborhoods

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:14.000
all around it more complex,

00:06:14.024 --> 00:06:15.929
more interesting, more walkable.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.073
Here's another kind of sprawl:

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:23.295
China, high-density sprawl,
what you think of as an oxymoron,

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.753
but the same problems,
everything isolated in superblocks,

00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:30.305
and of course this amazing smog
that was just spoken to.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:33.558
Twelve percent of GDP
in China now is spent

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.779
on the health impacts of that.

00:06:35.803 --> 00:06:39.068
The history, of course,
of Chinese cities is robust.

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:40.344
It's like any other place.

00:06:40.368 --> 00:06:43.380
Community was all about small, local shops

00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:47.547
and local services and walking,
interacting with your neighbors.

00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:49.695
It may sound utopian, but it's not.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.686
It's actually what people really want.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.257
The new superblocks --

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:57.201
these are blocks that would have
5,000 units in them,

00:06:57.225 --> 00:07:01.037
and they're gated as well,
because nobody knows anybody else.

00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.561
And of course, there isn't even
a sidewalk, no ground floor shops --

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:06.449
a very sterile environment.

00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:11.634
I found this one case
here in one of the superblocks

00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:14.884
where people had illicitly set up
shops in their garages

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:18.606
so that they could have that kind
of local service economy.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.387
The desire of people
to get it right is there.

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.699
We just have to get the planners
on board and the politicians.

00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:30.969
All right. Some technical planning stuff.

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:34.166
Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.553
It's almost as big as California.

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:38.267
This is a small growth area.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.903
They wanted us to test
the alternative to sprawl

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:44.701
in several cities across China.

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.354
This is for four-and-a-half
million people.

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:50.309
What the takeaway from this image is,

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:52.982
every one of those circles
is a walking radius

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.622
around a transit station --

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.235
massive investment in metro and BRT,

00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:01.276
and a distribution that allows everybody

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.911
to work within walking distance of that.

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:06.232
The red area, this is a blow-up.

00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:09.413
All of a sudden, our principles
called for green space

00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:13.127
preserving the important
ecological features.

00:08:13.151 --> 00:08:17.478
And then those other streets in there
are auto-free streets.

00:08:17.502 --> 00:08:21.125
So instead of bulldozing,
leveling the site

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:23.212
and building right up to the river,

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:27.460
this green edge was something
that really wasn't normative in China

00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:30.055
until these set of practices

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.633
began experimentation there.

00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:35.018
The urban fabric, small blocks,

00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:37.658
maybe 500 families per block.

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:38.951
They know each other.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:41.338
The street perimeter has shops

00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.284
so there's local destinations.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.663
And the streets themselves become smaller,

00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:47.217
because there are more of them.

00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.792
Very simple,

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:51.371
straightforward urban design.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:54.605
Now, here you have something
I dearly love.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:55.903
Think of the logic.

00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:58.499
If only a third of the people have cars,

00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:02.287
why do we give 100 percent
of our streets to cars?

00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:06.107
What if we gave 70 percent of the streets

00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:08.306
to car-free, to everybody else,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.575
so that the transit
could move well for them,

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.924
so that they could walk,
so they could bike?

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:14.346
Why not have --

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.823
(Applause)

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.000
geographic equity

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.395
in our circulation system?

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:24.091
And quite frankly,
cities would function better.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.770
No matter what they do,

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:28.224
no matter how many ring roads
they build in Beijing,

00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:31.176
they just can't overcome
complete gridlock.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.888
So this is an auto-free street,
mixed use along the edge.

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.525
It has transit running down the middle.

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:40.653
I'm happy to make that transit
autonomous vehicles,

00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:43.587
but maybe I'll have a chance
to talk about that later.

00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:47.334
So there are seven principles
that have now been adopted

00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:50.058
by the highest levels
in the Chinese government,

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:51.877
and they're moving to implement them.

00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.063
And they're simple,

00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:55.700
and they are globally,
I think, universal principles.

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:59.377
One is to preserve
the natural environment, the history

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.368
and the critical agriculture.

00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:03.629
Second is mix.

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:06.170
Mixed use is popular,
but when I say mixed,

00:10:06.194 --> 00:10:08.633
I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups

00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:11.149
as well as mixed-land use.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.344
Walk.

00:10:13.368 --> 00:10:16.388
There's no great city
that you don't enjoy walking in.

00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:17.730
You don't go there.

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:20.306
The places you go on vacation
are places you can walk.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.092
Why not make it everywhere?

00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:26.133
Bike is the most efficient
means of transportation we know.

00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:30.254
China has now adopted policies
that put six meters of bike lane

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:31.607
on every street.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.573
They're serious about getting back
to their biking history.

00:10:35.597 --> 00:10:37.053
(Applause)

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:39.380
Complicated planner-ese here:

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:40.733
connect.

00:10:40.757 --> 00:10:44.269
It's a street network
that allows many routes

00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:46.104
instead of singular routes

00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:49.675
and provides many kinds of streets
instead of just one.

00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:52.096
Ride.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.430
We have to invest more in transit.

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.229
There's no silver bullet.

00:10:56.253 --> 00:10:59.317
Autonomous vehicles are not
going to solve this for us.

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:04.507
As a matter of fact, they're going
to generate more traffic, more VMT,

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:05.893
than the alternative.

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:07.131
And focus.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:11.311
We have a hierarchy of the city
based on transit

00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:14.498
rather than the old armature of freeways.

00:11:14.522 --> 00:11:16.672
It's a big paradigm shift,

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:19.912
but those two things
have to get reconnected

00:11:19.936 --> 00:11:24.456
in ways that really shape
the structure of the city.

00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:27.676
So I'm very hopeful.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.473
In California, the United States, China --
these changes are well accepted.

00:11:32.497 --> 00:11:35.132
I'm hopeful for two reasons.

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:37.235
One is, most people get it.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.141
They understand intrinsically

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.807
what a great city can and should be.

00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:46.672
The second is that the kind of analysis
we can bring to bear now

00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:49.424
allows people to connect the dots,

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:52.905
allows people to shape
political coalitions

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:54.358
that didn't exist in the past.

00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:58.459
That allows them to bring into being
the kinds of communities we all need.

00:11:58.483 --> 00:11:59.672
Thank you.

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:06.273
(Applause)

00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:11.455
Chris Anderson: So, OK:
autonomous driving, self-driving cars.

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:14.824
A lot of people here
are very excited about them.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.402
What are your concerns
or issues about them?

00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:21.568
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think
there's almost too much hype here.

00:12:21.592 --> 00:12:25.166
First is, everybody says
we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.484
What they don't say is you're going
to get a lot more vehicle miles.

00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:31.055
You're going to get a lot more
cars moving on streets.

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:32.948
There will be more congestion.

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:35.280
CA: Because they're so appealing --

00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:37.358
you can drive while reading or sleeping.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:38.879
PC: Well, a couple of reasons.

00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:42.874
One is, if they're privately owned,
people will travel greater distances.

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:44.839
It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.878
If you can work on your way to work,

00:12:46.902 --> 00:12:48.969
you can live in more remote locations.

00:12:48.993 --> 00:12:51.535
It'll revitalize sprawl

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.892
in a way that I'm deeply frightened.

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:55.770
Taxis:

00:12:55.794 --> 00:12:59.542
about 50 percent of the surveys say
that people won't share them.

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:00.940
If they don't share them,

00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:06.161
you can end up with a 90 percent
increase in vehicle miles traveled.

00:13:06.597 --> 00:13:07.918
If you share them,

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:11.472
you're still at around
a 30 percent increase in VMT.

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:14.534
CA: Sharing them, meaning
having multiple people riding at once

00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:16.534
in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?

00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:19.089
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share
without a steering wheel.

00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:22.962
The reality is, the efficiency
of vehicles -- you can do it

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.477
with or without a steering wheel,
it doesn't matter.

00:13:25.501 --> 00:13:28.994
They claim they're the only ones
that are going to be efficient electric,

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:30.172
but that's not true.

00:13:30.196 --> 00:13:33.766
But the real bottom line
is that walking, biking and transit

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.954
are the way cities and communities thrive.

00:13:36.978 --> 00:13:39.785
And putting people
in their private bubbles,

00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:42.106
whether they have a steering wheel or not,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.701
is the wrong direction.

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:44.876
And quite frankly,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:50.579
the image of an AV on its way
to McDonald's to pick up a pack

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:52.287
without its owner,

00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:56.021
just being sent off on these
kind of random errands

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:57.442
is really frightening to me.

00:13:57.466 --> 00:14:00.824
CA: Well, thank you for that,
and I have to say, the images you showed

00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:04.024
of those mixed-use streets
were really inspiring, really beautiful.

00:14:04.048 --> 00:14:06.207
PC: Thank you.
CA: Thank you for your work.

00:14:06.231 --> 00:14:07.690
(Applause)
