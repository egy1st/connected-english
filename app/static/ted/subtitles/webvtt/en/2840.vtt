00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:04.539
So, raise your hand
if you've seen somebody in your city

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:07.942
standing on a corner,
holding a sign like this.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.658
I think we all have.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:12.847
If you're being honest,

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.488
at least one time,
have you wondered if they mean it?

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:19.665
If we offered them a job,
would they really take it?

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.170
And what would that job mean
to them in their lives?

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:26.044
Well, this is a story
about what happened in my city

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:27.620
when we decided to find out,

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:32.099
when we decided to think differently
about panhandling,

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:35.020
and lift people up
through the dignity of work.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:37.911
We call it, "There's a Better Way."

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:39.877
We call it There's a Better Way

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.939
because I believe there's a better way
to get the money you need

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.630
than panhandling on the corner.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.158
I believe there's a better way
to help your brothers and sisters in need

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.515
than handing a few dollars
out the car window.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.372
We know there's dignity in work.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.506
We also know that people are much more
likely to invest in themselves

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.170
if they believe that their community
is willing to invest in them first.

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:06.787
And because we're all wired
to be kind and compassionate,

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.316
it always feels good to hand
a couple of dollars to someone

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.541
that is in need.

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:16.234
But if you talk to panhandlers,
many of them will tell you

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:21.448
that your few dollars don't necessarily
go towards feeding the body,

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:23.478
they go towards feeding an addiction.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:25.773
There's a better way.

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:27.861
My name is Richard Berry,

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.252
and I have one of the best
jobs in the world.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.710
I get to be the mayor
of a great American city,

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:34.302
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:41.391
I was at lunch on July 17, 2015,
in my great American city,

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:44.397
and on my way back to city hall,

00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.612
I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.032
As you can see, he's holding a sign,

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:50.971
and his sign says he wants a job.

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:53.515
But if you look closer at the picture,

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.778
you'll see he's standing
underneath a blue sign,

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:59.914
and that sign says, if you need help,
if you need food or shelter

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:01.195
or you'd like to donate,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.015
please call 311,
our community service number.

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:10.354
So why is this guy standing
underneath my sign with his sign?

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.634
Well, we wondered
if anybody would call that 311 sign,

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:15.214
and as it turns out, they did --

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:16.969
11,000 times people called.

00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:19.057
I put those up in about 30 intersections.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.455
And we did connect them
with food and shelter and services.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.541
But yet he's still standing under my sign

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:26.447
with a sign that says he wants a job.

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:29.695
It's simple: he wants a job.

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:33.727
So I decided to do
something rare in government.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.602
I decided to make the solution simpler
rather than more complicated.

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:41.151
I went back to my office,
I gathered my staff around

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.786
and I said, "We're going
to take this man at his word,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.995
and others like him.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.796
The man says he wants a job,
we're going to give him a job,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.629
and we're going to make our city
an even better place in the meantime."

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.308
You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:55.603
We're a mile high,

00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:57.733
the Sandia Mountains on the east,

00:02:57.757 --> 00:03:00.297
the Rio Grande runs through
the center of the city;

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:03.385
we're the home of the Albuquerque
International Balloon Fiesta.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.573
On a day like today,

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:07.541
you could literally ski this morning
and golf this afternoon.

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:09.922
But there's always something to do --

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:12.048
always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:15.741
If you're going to have an initiative
like this in your city,

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.660
you have to ask yourself two questions.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.354
First one is: Is there anything
left to do in your city?

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:21.560
And if the answer is no,

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:23.992
would you please give me
your mayor's phone number,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.339
because I need some advice.

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:26.370
(Laughter)

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.661
But the second question
you have to ask is this:

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:31.049
Are your solutions to panhandling working?

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:33.972
If you're like Albuquerque,

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.642
and you're taking the punitive
approach like we used to,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.800
handing out tickets to panhandlers
or those who give them money,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.498
I'm going to suggest
that your solutions aren't working,

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.120
and I know you're not getting
to the root of your problem in your city.

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.406
So if you have something to do

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.786
and you need people
that need something to do,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.020
there's a better way.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:55.347
And the good news is,
it's not that complicated.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.316
This a 2006 Dodge van.

00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:01.326
It was in my motor pool
not doing anything.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.292
We put some new tires on it,
wrapped it with a logo.

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:08.111
This van now goes out to street corners
where our panhandlers are --

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:09.324
we go to them.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.302
We stop the van, we get out,

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:13.358
we ask them if they
would like a day's work

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:15.341
rather than panhandling for the day.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:18.700
And if you wondered
if they really mean it --

00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.892
it takes us about an hour
to fill this van up in the morning,

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:26.335
because almost everybody we ask
takes a job for the day.

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.035
But you need more than just a van.

00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:32.511
You need a super-fantastic
human being to drive that van.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:35.946
And my super-fantastic human being,
his name is Will.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.741
This is him in the yellow vest.

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:40.299
Will works at our local nonprofit partner.

00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:42.146
He works with the homeless every day.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.899
The panhandlers trust him,

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:46.072
he believes in them,

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.918
he hustles.

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.918
I like to say, "Where
there's a Will, there's a way."

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:54.320
So if you're going to do
the Better Way campaign in your city,

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:55.996
you need to find yourself a Will,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.997
because he's really one of the keys
to making this successful

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:02.621
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.832
You also need a great nonprofit partner.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.379
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.912
They've been in our community
for over 30 years.

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:12.449
They provide counseling, food, shelter,

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:13.876
and if they don't provide it,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.916
they know somebody in our city that does.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.993
But they do something much more
for me as the mayor.

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.652
They provide agility.

00:05:20.676 --> 00:05:22.889
You see, it takes me two weeks,

00:05:22.913 --> 00:05:24.683
maybe two months sometimes,

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.242
to onboard an employee
with the city of Albuquerque.

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:29.779
So you could imagine --

00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:30.972
my old Dodge van,

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:33.306
my super-fantastic human being, Will,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.225
a great local nonprofit partner --

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.483
they drive to the corner,
there's a panhandler,

00:05:37.507 --> 00:05:39.761
they say, "Would you like
to work for the day?"

00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.081
The panhandler says, "Yes,"

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:44.253
and Will says, "Great! I'll be back
in six weeks to pick you up."

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.300
(Laughter)

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:46.475
It wouldn't work.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.738
It's really important that we have
that agility in our program.

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:52.436
And they do the paperwork,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.984
they do the insurance,

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:57.329
they do all of the other forms
that I can't do quickly.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.949
We pay our panhandlers
nine dollars an hour.

00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:02.226
We feed them once at the jobsite.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.403
At the end of the day,

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.079
our old Dodge van takes them
right back to St. Martin's,

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.447
and they get connected
with counseling services.

00:06:09.783 --> 00:06:10.965
So far,

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.471
with the pilot program
and a couple days a week,

00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:16.158
and a fantastic human being
and a Dodge van,

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:19.578
we've cleaned up 400 city blocks
in the city of Albuquerque.

00:06:19.602 --> 00:06:24.085
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds
of trash, weeds and litter.

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:26.432
I don't know if you've ever
weighed a tumbleweed,

00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:27.737
but they don't weigh much,

00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.565
so you can imagine the volume
of material that we've picked up.

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.538
My city has 6,000 employees,

00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:37.807
and none better
than my solid waste department.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.537
We send our trucks out
at the end of the day,

00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:42.793
they help the panhandlers
put into the truck

00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:45.060
the material they've picked up
during the day,

00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:46.587
and we take it to the landfill.

00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.375
I'm lucky that I have city employees

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.340
that are willing to work side by side
with our panhandlers.

00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:54.350
They're lifting up our city
while lifting up their lives.

00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:57.440
And like anything else --
listen, it takes resources.

00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:00.192
But the good news is it doesn't take much.

00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:03.020
We started with an old van,

00:07:03.044 --> 00:07:04.782
a super-fantastic human being,

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:06.100
a great local nonprofit

00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:07.720
and $50,000.

00:07:08.648 --> 00:07:10.814
But we also had to have community trust.

00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:14.385
And fortunately, we had built
that up in years prior to Better Way.

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.468
We have a program called
"Albuquerque Heading Home,"

00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:20.536
a Housing First model where we house
the chronically homeless,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.645
and when I told my community
we wanted to do that differently,

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.326
I said there's a smart way
to do the right thing.

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:30.885
We have now housed 650 chronically
homeless, medically vulnerable --

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.715
frankly, most likely to die
on the streets in our city.

00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:36.726
We commissioned our university,
they studied it.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.404
We could tell the taxpayers,
we can save you 31.6 percent

00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:44.003
over the cost of leaving someone
to struggle for survival on the streets.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.428
We've now saved over five million dollars
while housing 650 people.

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.419
So we had that community trust,

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:53.658
but we had to have a little bit more
of an honest conversation also

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.169
as a community,

00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:57.219
because we had to get people to understand

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:59.786
that when they hand
those five dollars out the window,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.206
they might actually be minimizing
their opportunity

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.286
to help the person in need,
and here's why:

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.123
that five dollars might go
to buying some fast food today --

00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:10.649
a lot of times it goes to buying
drugs and alcohol.

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:12.323
That same five dollars,

00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:14.605
if you gave it to one of our shelters,

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.390
could feed seven people today.

00:08:16.414 --> 00:08:20.696
And if you gave it to one of our local
food banks or food pantries,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.230
we could actually feed
20 people with that money.

00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:30.739
People ask,"Well, Albuquerque
is 600,000 people -- million, metro --

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:33.854
this wouldn't work in our city,
we're too big, we're too small."

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:36.573
I disagree; if you have
one panhandler on one city block,

00:08:36.597 --> 00:08:37.753
you can do this.

00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:40.395
If you live in a city
of eight-and-half million people,

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.574
you can do this.

00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:43.075
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:45.961
It's not the work that you do,
it's the dignity of the work.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.143
You could do anything.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:49.267
So I think any city could do this.

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.490
And people say to me,

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:52.578
"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:55.461
It can't work that way."

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:57.034
But I tell you what, friends:

00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:58.501
when you go to a street corner

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:01.453
and you engage with a panhandler
with dignity and respect,

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:04.177
maybe for the first time in years,
maybe in their life,

00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.256
and you tell them that you believe in them

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.952
and that this is their city
as much as it's your city,

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:13.743
and that you actually need their help
to make our place better,

00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:17.085
and you understand that this
isn't the answer to all their problems,

00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:19.027
but at least it's a start,

00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:20.693
an amazing thing happens.

00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:24.599
When they get out on the jobsite
and they start working together,

00:09:24.623 --> 00:09:26.520
you start seeing amazing things happen.

00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:29.847
They see teamwork; they see
the fact that they can make a difference.

00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:31.112
And at the end of the day,

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:33.832
when they get back to St. Martin's
in that old Dodge van,

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:37.184
they're much more likely to sign up
for whatever services they need --

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:39.927
substance abuse, mental health
counseling, you name it.

00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:42.371
So far with our pilot program,

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:45.264
we've offered
about 1,700 days of day work.

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:49.404
We've connected 216 people
to permanent employment opportunities.

00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:53.538
Twenty people actually qualified
for our Housing First model,

00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:54.740
Heading Home,

00:09:54.764 --> 00:09:55.923
and they've been housed.

00:09:55.947 --> 00:09:58.106
And over 150 people have been connected

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.948
to mental health substance abuse services

00:10:00.972 --> 00:10:02.668
through There's a Better Way.

00:10:02.692 --> 00:10:05.329
This is me just two weeks ago,

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:08.106
at St. Martin's,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.582
doing our point-in-time survey

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:10.983
that we do every two years.

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:14.962
I'm interviewing a gentleman
who's homeless, like we do,

00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:17.730
getting his information,
figuring out where he's from,

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:19.482
how he got there,

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:21.109
what we can do to help him.

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:25.104
And you notice he's holding the same sign
that the guy was holding in 2015,

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:27.231
same sign I walked out with here today.

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:31.139
So you have to ask yourself:
Is it really making a difference?

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.172
Absolutely it's making a difference.

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:35.854
Albuquerque is now
one of the national leaders

00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:39.104
in combating some of the most stubborn
and persistent social issues

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:40.279
that we have.

00:10:40.303 --> 00:10:42.182
Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,

00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:43.397
the Better Way program,

00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:46.361
Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered
homelessness in our city

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:48.371
by 80 percent last year.

00:10:49.403 --> 00:10:50.717
Since I took over as mayor,

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:54.005
we've been able to reduce the chronic
homeless population in our city

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.258
by 40 percent.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.445
And by HUD's definition,

00:10:57.469 --> 00:10:59.162
we've gotten to functional zero,

00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:01.834
which means we've literally ended
veteran homelessness

00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:03.198
in the city of Albuquerque,

00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:04.652
by being intentional.

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:07.982
(Applause)

00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:14.168
So I'm happy to report
that other cities are hearing about this,

00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:15.736
other mayors are calling us --

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.483
Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --

00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:21.043
and are now starting to implement programs

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:24.142
where they bring the dignity
of work to the equation.

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.021
And I can't wait to learn from them.

00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:28.722
I can't wait to see
what their experiment looks like,

00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:30.781
what their pilot project looks like,

00:11:30.805 --> 00:11:33.378
so we can start taking
a collective approach nationally

00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:34.778
through the dignity of work.

00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:36.183
And I want to commend them --

00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:38.618
the mayors, their communities,
their nonprofits --

00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:40.242
for the work that they're doing.

00:11:40.854 --> 00:11:42.153
So who's next?

00:11:43.493 --> 00:11:45.944
Are you and your city ready to step up?

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.457
Are you ready to think differently
about these persistent social issues?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.276
Are you ready to lift people up
in your community

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.229
through the dignity of work,

00:11:55.253 --> 00:11:58.222
and make your city
profoundly better in many ways?

00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:02.509
Well, if you are, my friends,
I promise you there is a better way.

00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:03.691
Thank you.

00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:07.119
(Applause)
