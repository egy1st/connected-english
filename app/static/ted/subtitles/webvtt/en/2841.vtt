WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.791
I'm here to offer you
a new way to think about my field,

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.583
artificial intelligence.

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.621
I think the purpose of AI

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:12.079
is to empower humans
with machine intelligence.

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:15.736
And as machines get smarter,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.013
we get smarter.

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:20.419
I call this "humanistic AI" --

00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:24.114
artificial intelligence
designed to meet human needs

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:27.069
by collaborating and augmenting people.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.059
Now, today I'm happy to see

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.260
that the idea of an intelligent assistant

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.753
is mainstream.

00:00:33.777 --> 00:00:38.837
It's the well-accepted metaphor
for the interface between humans and AI.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.253
And the one I helped create
is called Siri.

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:44.109
You know Siri.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.778
Siri is the thing that knows your intent

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.844
and helps you do it for you,

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:50.369
helps you get things done.

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.867
But what you might not know
is that we designed Siri

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.611
as humanistic AI,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.806
to augment people
with a conversational interface

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.283
that made it possible for them
to use mobile computing,

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:05.591
regardless of who they were
and their abilities.

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:08.391
Now for most of us,

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:11.196
the impact of this technology

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.503
is to make things
a little bit easier to use.

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.095
But for my friend Daniel,

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:20.523
the impact of the AI
in these systems is a life changer.

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:26.050
You see, Daniel is a really social guy,

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:27.833
and he's blind and quadriplegic,

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:32.473
which makes it hard to use those devices
that we all take for granted.

00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:34.939
The last time I was at his house,
his brother said,

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:36.821
"Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:39.187
He's on the phone with a woman
he met online."

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.260
I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?"

00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:45.778
Well, Daniel uses Siri
to manage his own social life --

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.671
his email, text and phone --

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:51.171
without depending on his caregivers.

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:54.239
This is kind of interesting, right?

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:55.580
The irony here is great.

00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:58.500
Here's the man whose relationship with AI

00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:01.701
helps him have relationships
with genuine human beings.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:05.935
And this is humanistic AI.

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:09.802
Another example with
life-changing consequences

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:11.083
is diagnosing cancer.

00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:14.950
When a doctor suspects cancer,

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:17.677
they take a sample
and send it to a pathologist,

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.653
who looks at it under a microscope.

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.670
Now, pathologists look at
hundreds of slides

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.018
and millions of cells every day.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.017
So to support this task,

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.483
some researchers made an AI classifier.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:36.101
Now, the classifier says,
"Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.430
looking at the pictures.

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.919
The classifier was pretty good,

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.652
but not as good as the person,

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.713
who got it right most of the time.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:52.607
But when they combine the ability
of the machine and the human together,

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.626
accuracy went to 99.5 percent.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.151
Adding that AI to a partnership
eliminated 85 percent of the errors

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:05.861
that the human pathologist
would have made working alone.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.979
That's a lot of cancer
that would have otherwise gone untreated.

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:13.027
Now, for the curious, it turns out

00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:16.525
that the human was better
at rejecting false positives,

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.121
and the machine was better
at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:23.382
But the lesson here isn't about
which agent is better

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.484
at this image-classification task.

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:27.727
Those things are changing every day.

00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.319
The lesson here

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.703
is that by combining the abilities
of the human and machine,

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:37.678
it created a partnership
that had superhuman performance.

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:41.483
And that is humanistic AI.

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:44.773
Now let's look at another example

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:47.084
with turbocharging performance.

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:48.511
This is design.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.576
Now, let's say you're an engineer.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.717
You want to design
a new frame for a drone.

00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:55.805
You get out your favorite
software tools, CAD tools,

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.044
and you enter the form and the materials,
and then you analyze performance.

00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:01.412
That gives you one design.

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:05.839
If you give those same tools to an AI,

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.987
it can generate thousands of designs.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.127
This video by Autodesk is amazing.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.451
This is real stuff.

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:17.163
So this transforms how we do design.

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:18.615
The human engineer now

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.954
says what the design should achieve,

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:23.134
and the machine says,

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.528
"Here's the possibilities."

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.698
Now in her job, the engineer's job

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:31.822
is to pick the one that best meets
the goals of the design,

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:35.185
which she knows as a human
better than anyone else,

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.003
using human judgment and expertise.

00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:38.994
In this case, the winning form

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:41.729
looks kind of like something
nature would have designed,

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:43.868
minus a few million years of evolution

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:46.273
and all that unnecessary fur.

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:53.096
Now let's see where this idea
of humanistic AI might lead us

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.513
if we follow it into
the speculative beyond.

00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:59.122
What's a kind of augmentation
that we would all like to have?

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.435
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:05.383
Instead of asking,

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:07.468
"How smart can we make our machines?"

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:08.665
let's ask

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.394
"How smart can our machines make us?"

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.885
I mean, take memory for example.

00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.457
Memory is the foundation
of human intelligence.

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:22.738
But human memory is famously flawed.

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.615
We're great at telling stories,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.590
but not getting the details right.

00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:30.820
And our memories -- they decay over time.

00:05:30.844 --> 00:05:34.076
I mean, like, where did the '60s go,
and can I go there, too?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.567
(Laughter)

00:05:36.648 --> 00:05:40.952
But what if you could have a memory
that was as good as computer memory,

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:45.017
and was about your life?

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:48.503
What if you could remember
every person you ever met,

00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:50.473
how to pronounce their name,

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:52.589
their family details,
their favorite sports,

00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:54.576
the last conversation you had with them?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.255
If you had this memory all your life,

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.577
you could have the AI look
at all the interactions

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:02.018
you had with people over time

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:05.835
and help you reflect on the long arc
of your relationships.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.596
What if you could have the AI read
everything you've ever read

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.134
and listen to every song
you've ever heard?

00:06:15.344 --> 00:06:19.083
From the tiniest clue,
it could help you retrieve

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:21.220
anything you've ever seen or heard before.

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:25.181
Imagine what that would do
for the ability to make new connections

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:26.785
and form new ideas.

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.797
And what about our bodies?

00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:34.010
What if we could remember the consequences
of every food we eat,

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:35.535
every pill we take,

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.320
every all-nighter we pull?

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.758
We could do our own science
on our own data

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:45.642
about what makes us feel
good and stay healthy.

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:48.142
And imagine how this could revolutionize

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:50.856
the way we manage
allergies and chronic disease.

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.883
I believe that AI will make
personal memory enhancement a reality.

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:01.946
I can't say when or what
form factors are involved,

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:04.590
but I think it's inevitable,

00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:10.750
because the very things
that make AI successful today --

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.267
the availability of comprehensive data

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:16.839
and the ability for machines
to make sense of that data --

00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.922
can be applied to the data of our lives.

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:23.992
And those data are here today,
available for all of us,

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:27.884
because we lead digitally mediated lives,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.705
in mobile and online.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:35.723
In my view, a personal memory
is a private memory.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:39.684
We get to choose what is and is not
recalled and retained.

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:44.181
It's absolutely essential
that this be kept very secure.

00:07:45.294 --> 00:07:46.756
Now for most of us,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.673
the impact of augmented personal memory

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:52.432
will be a more improved mental gain,

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.911
maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.

00:07:56.658 --> 00:08:01.305
But for the millions who suffer
from Alzheimer's and dementia,

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:05.412
the difference that augmented
memory could make

00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:07.897
is a difference
between a life of isolation

00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:10.795
and a life of dignity and connection.

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:17.813
We are in the middle of a renaissance
in artificial intelligence right now.

00:08:18.652 --> 00:08:20.623
I mean, in just the past few years,

00:08:20.647 --> 00:08:24.278
we're beginning to see
solutions to AI problems

00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:28.272
that we have struggled
with literally for decades:

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:31.893
speech understanding, text understanding,

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.237
image understanding.

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:38.252
We have a choice in how we use
this powerful technology.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:44.132
We can choose to use AI
to automate and compete with us,

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:48.133
or we can use AI to augment
and collaborate with us,

00:08:48.157 --> 00:08:51.228
to overcome our cognitive limitations

00:08:51.252 --> 00:08:54.414
and to help us do what we want to do,

00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:55.729
only better.

00:08:56.339 --> 00:09:02.843
And as we discover new ways
to give machines intelligence,

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:05.936
we can distribute that intelligence

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.341
to all of the AI assistants in the world,

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:11.899
and therefore to every person,
regardless of circumstance.

00:09:13.189 --> 00:09:14.718
And that is why,

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:17.903
every time a machine gets smarter,

00:09:18.628 --> 00:09:20.032
we get smarter.

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:24.761
That is an AI worth spreading.

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:25.967
Thank you.

00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:29.964
(Applause)
