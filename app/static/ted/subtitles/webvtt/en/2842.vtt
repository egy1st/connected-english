00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.600
Here's an intriguing fact.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.016
In the developed world,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.200
everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.136
Six to eight years longer.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.040
That's, like, a huge gap.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.696
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.176
showing that men in rich countries

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.176
are twice as likely to die as women are

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.400
at any age.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.976
But there is one place in the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
where men live as long as women.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.536
It's a remote, mountainous zone,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.776
a blue zone,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.296
where super longevity

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.120
is common to both sexes.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.856
This is the blue zone in Sardinia,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.896
an Italian island in the Mediterranean,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.536
between Corsica and Tunisia,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.936
where there are six times
as many centenarians

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.856
as on the Italian mainland,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.480
less than 200 miles away.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.816
There are 10 times as many centenarians

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.640
as there are in North America.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.560
It's the only place
where men live as long as women.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.456
But why?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.120
My curiosity was piqued.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.056
I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.496
and I started with the genetic profile.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.576
I discovered soon enough

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.616
that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.160
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.760
So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.760
What are they doing right?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.656
What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.216
It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.376
where I went to investigate this,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.120
and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.456
density is:

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.456
tightly spaced houses,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.016
interwoven alleys and streets.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.640
It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.016
And as I walked through the village,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.176
I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.816
from behind doorways and curtains,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.576
from behind shutters.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.016
Because like all ancient villages,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.616
Villagrande couldn't have survived

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.896
without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.816
without its village square,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.000
because defense and social cohesion
defined its design.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.896
Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.776
because infectious disease
became the risk of the day.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.000
But what about now?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.280
Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.456
Now, a third of the population says

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080
they have two or fewer people to lean on.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.736
But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.816
to meet some centenarians.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.736
Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.816
and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.776
He was a gregarious man.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.096
He loved to recount stories

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.776
such as how he lived like a bird

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.096
from what he could find
on the forest floor

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.496
during not one but two world wars,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.616
how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.976
raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.200
where I interviewed him.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.576
Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.656
both in their 70s
and looking after their father,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.936
and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.696
who came along with me
on this research trip,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.536
because the flip side of social cohesion

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.376
is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.296
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.256
He was a happy-go-lucky guy,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.936
very outgoing with a positive outlook.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.496
And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.720
thinking positively?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.216
Actually, no.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.800
(Laughter)

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.456
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.496
the grumpiest person I have ever met.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.016
(Laughter)

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.736
And he put a lie to the notion

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.320
that you have to be positive
to live a long life.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.136
And there is evidence for this.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.696
When I asked him why he lived so long,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.136
he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.296
"Nobody has to know my secrets."

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.536
(Laughter)

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.776
But despite being a sourpuss,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.136
the niece who lived with him
and looked after him

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.720
called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure."

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.536
And she respected him and loved him,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.240
and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.256
"You just don't understand, do you?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.976
Looking after this man is a pleasure.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.976
It's a huge privilege for me.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.320
This is my heritage."

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.696
And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.000
I found a kitchen party.

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:45.176
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.416
Maria above him

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.376
and beside him his great-niece Sara,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.176
who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.496
And I quickly discovered by being there

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.776
that in the blue zone, as people age,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.256
and indeed across their lifespans,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.376
they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.696
by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.016
People are always there or dropping by.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.160
They are never left
to live solitary lives.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.296
This is unlike the rest
of the developed world,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.776
where as George Burns quipped,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840
"Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city."

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.976
(Laughter)

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.416
Now, so far we've only met men,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.536
long-living men, but I met women too,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.160
and here you see Zia Teresa.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.056
She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.736
which is called culurgiones,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.536
which are these large pasta pockets

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720
like ravioli about this size,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.656
this size,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.216
and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.016
and drenched in tomato sauce.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.280
And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.776
so they wouldn't open,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.816
and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.800
and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.656
And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.296
is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.576
(Applause)

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.216
Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.056
prompted me to ask myself
some questions too,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.720
such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.040
And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.736
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.656
and she addressed this very question

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.176
in a series of studies

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.096
of tens of thousands of middle aged people

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.256
much like this audience here.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.216
And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle:

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.376
their diet, their exercise,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.896
their marital status,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.576
how often they went to the doctor,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.096
whether they smoked or drank, etc.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.336
She recorded all of this

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.936
and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.680
to see who would still be breathing.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.880
And of the people left standing,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.880
what reduced their chances
of dying the most?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.056
That was her question.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.616
So let's now look at her data in summary,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.376
going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.616
OK?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.896
So clean air, which is great,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.960
it doesn't predict how long you will live.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.736
Whether you have your hypertension treated

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.096
is good.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.896
Still not a strong predictor.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.416
Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.816
because it's only in third place.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.336
How much exercise you get is next,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.696
still only a moderate predictor.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.456
Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.016
getting higher now.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.656
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.936
Did anybody here know

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.760
that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.216
Whether you were drinking and quit,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.216
or whether you're a moderate drinker,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.720
whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.176
and getting towards the top predictors

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.736
are two features of your social life.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.136
First, your close relationships.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.456
These are the people
that you can call on for a loan

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.096
if you need money suddenly,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.696
who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.536
or who will take you to the hospital,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.376
or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.376
if you're in despair.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.015
Those people, that little clutch of people

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.576
are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.936
And then something that surprised me,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.576
something that's called
social integration.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.656
This means how much
you interact with people

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.080
as you move through your day.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.856
How many people do you talk to?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.456
And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.976
so not just the people
you're really close to,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.376
who mean a lot to you,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.936
but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.736
Do you talk to the postman?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.216
Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.216
Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.416
Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.776
of how long you'll live.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.760
Now, this leads me to the next question:

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.256
if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.936
including sleeping,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.136
we're now up to 11 hours a day,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.656
one hour more than last year, by the way,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.496
does it make a difference?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.536
Why distinguish
between interacting in person

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.776
and interacting via social media?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.656
Is it the same thing as being there

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.360
if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.336
Well, the short answer
to the question is no,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.016
it's not the same thing.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.856
Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.176
and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.056
and well into the future.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.600
So simply making
eye contact with somebody,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.176
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.256
is enough to release oxytocin,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.496
which increases your level of trust

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.360
and it lowers your cortisol levels.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.760
So it lowers your stress.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.256
And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.496
and it kills pain.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.440
It's like a naturally produced morphine.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.856
Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.560
which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.536
But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.896
that there is a difference.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.976
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.296
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.136
tried to map the difference

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.816
between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.056
versus when we're watching
something that's static.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.509
And what she did was
she compared the brain function

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:52.576
of two groups of people,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.896
those interacting live with her

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.056
or with one of her research associates

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.256
in a dynamic conversation,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.776
and she compared that
to the brain activity of people

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.536
who were watching her talk
about the same subject

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.040
but in a canned video, like on YouTube.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.576
And by the way, if you want to know

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.416
how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.640
talk to me later.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.760
So what's the difference?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.000
This is your brain
on real social interaction.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.736
What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.896
between interacting in person
and taking in static content.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.896
In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.136
social intelligence --

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.736
that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.496
and feeling and planning --

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.056
and emotional reward.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.856
And these areas become much more engaged

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.160
when we're interacting
with a live partner.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.816
Now, these richer brain signatures

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.896
might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.856
evaluating candidates

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.656
thought that the candidates were smarter

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.160
when they heard their voices

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.416
compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.856
or an email or a letter.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.656
Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.696
It shows that we're thinking, feeling,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.376
sentient human beings

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.896
who are much more than an algorithm.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.976
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.280
at the University of Chicago
Business School

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.120
is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.816
If somebody hears your voice,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.160
they think you're smarter.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.920
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.240
Now, to return to the beginning,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.936
why do women live longer than men?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.296
And one major reason
is that women are more likely

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.696
to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.376
over their lifespans.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.056
Fresh evidence shows

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.776
that these in-person friendships

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.776
create a biological force field
against disease and decline.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.976
And it's not just true of humans

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.376
but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.056
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.976
who have a core of female friends

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.576
show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.080
they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.016
At least three stable relationships.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.536
That was the magic number.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.776
Think about it.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.086
I hope you guys have three.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.720
The power of such face-to-face contact

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.296
is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.136
among people who are socially engaged.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.976
It's why women who have breast cancer

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.296
are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.296
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.976
or to have coffee

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.256
or to play old-timer's hockey --

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.576
I'm Canadian, after all --

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.736
(Laughter)

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.256
are better protected
by that social contact

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.296
than they are by medication.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.416
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly --

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.896
this is something very
powerful they can do.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.616
This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.120
yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.496
We can do something about this.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.296
Like Sardinian villagers,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.016
it's a biological imperative
to know we belong,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.056
and not just the women among us.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.216
Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.720
into our agendas

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.296
bolsters the immune system,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.336
sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.960
and helps us live longer.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.496
I call this building your village,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.120
and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.976
Thank you.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680
(Applause)

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.896
Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.816
I'm wondering if there's a middle path.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.256
So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.936
but what about digital technology?

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.536
We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.016
like FaceTime, things like that.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.296
Does that work too?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.576
I mean, I see my nephew.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.016
He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.056
It seems like he's connecting pretty well.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.856
Is that useful? Is that helpful?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.216
Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.216
The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.976
and the health data trailed behind.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.376
So we're just learning,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.416
but I would say
there are some improvements

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.256
that we could make in the technology.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.736
For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.816
so for example, when you're
looking into the screen,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.736
you're not actually making eye contact.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.936
So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.216
can increase those neurotransmitters,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.816
or maybe changing
the position of the camera.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.536
So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.296
HW: Great. Thank you so much.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.536
SP: Thank you.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.710
(Applause)
