WEBVTT

00:00:01.058 --> 00:00:05.150
What's one thing that every person
in this room is going to become?

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:06.351
Older.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.941
And most of us are scared stiff
at the prospect.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:10.637
How does that word make you feel?

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.290
I used to feel the same way.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.610
What was I most worried about?

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.935
Ending up drooling
in some grim institutional hallway.

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.494
And then I learned that only
four percent of older Americans

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:23.907
are living in nursing homes,

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.495
and the percentage is dropping.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.246
What else was I worried about?

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.680
Dementia.

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.849
Turns out that most of us
can think just fine to the end.

00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:34.782
Dementia rates are dropping, too.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.711
The real epidemic is anxiety
over memory loss.

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:39.595
(Laughter)

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.135
I also figured that old people
were depressed

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.608
because they were old
and they were going to die soon.

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:47.381
(Laughter)

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.359
It turns out that the longer people live,

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:50.882
the less they fear dying,

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.635
and that people are happiest at
the beginnings and the end of their lives.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.656
It's called the U-curve of happiness,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.985
and it's been borne out
by dozens of studies around the world.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.585
You don't have to be a Buddhist
or a billionaire.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.598
The curve is a function of the way
aging itself affects the brain.

00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:10.410
So I started feeling a lot better
about getting older,

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:15.335
and I started obsessing about why
so few people know these things.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.005
The reason is ageism:

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:20.533
discrimination and stereotyping
on the basis of age.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:25.062
We experience it anytime someone assumes
we're too old for something,

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.386
instead of finding out who we are
and what we're capable of,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.883
or too young.

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.756
Ageism cuts both ways.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:37.570
All -isms are socially constructed
ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.774
and that means we make them up,

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.582
and they can change over time.

00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:45.127
All these prejudices
pit us against each other

00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.293
to maintain the status quo,

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:51.439
like auto workers in the US competing
against auto workers in Mexico

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.046
instead of organizing for better wages.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.959
(Applause)

00:01:55.983 --> 00:02:00.374
We know it's not OK to allocate
resources by race or by sex.

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:03.751
Why should it be OK to weigh
the needs of the young against the old?

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:08.223
All prejudice relies on "othering" --
seeing a group of people

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:09.671
as other than ourselves:

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.786
other race, other religion,
other nationality.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.494
The strange thing about ageism:

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.505
that other is us.

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:21.192
Ageism feeds on denial --
our reluctance to acknowledge

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:24.166
that we are going to become
that older person.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.800
It's denial when we try
to pass for younger

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:30.738
or when we believe in anti-aging products,

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.574
or when we feel like our bodies
are betraying us,

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:35.528
simply because they are changing.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:40.169
Why on earth do we stop celebrating
the ability to adapt and grow

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.739
as we move through life?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.344
Why should aging well mean
struggling to look and move

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:47.452
like younger versions of ourselves?

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.000
It's embarrassing
to be called out as older

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.095
until we quit being embarrassed about it,

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.253
and it's not healthy to go through life
dreading our futures.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:58.713
The sooner we get off
this hamster wheel of age denial,

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:00.585
the better off we are.

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:03.719
Stereotypes are always
a mistake, of course,

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:05.469
but especially when it comes to age,

00:03:05.493 --> 00:03:06.830
because the longer we live,

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.998
the more different
from one another we become.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.399
Right? Think about it.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.149
And yet, we tend to think of everyone
in a retirement home

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:15.043
as the same age: old --

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.584
(Laughter)

00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:19.038
when they can span four decades.

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:21.729
Can you imagine thinking that way
about a group of people

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.895
between the ages of 20 and 60?

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.861
When you get to a party, do you head
for people your own age?

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:30.971
Have you ever grumbled
about entitled millennials?

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.141
Have you ever rejected a haircut
or a relationship or an outing

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.515
because it's not age-appropriate?

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.347
For adults, there's no such thing.

00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:41.818
All these behaviors are ageist.

00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:43.513
We all do them,

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:46.674
and we can't challenge bias
unless we're aware of it.

00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:48.034
Nobody's born ageist,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.724
but it starts at early childhood,

00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:53.198
around the same time attitudes
towards race and gender start to form,

00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:56.654
because negative messages
about late life bombard us

00:03:56.678 --> 00:04:00.030
from the media and popular
culture at every turn.

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:01.627
Right? Wrinkles are ugly.

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.168
Old people are pathetic.

00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:05.019
It's sad to be old.

00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:06.434
Look at Hollywood.

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:08.562
A survey of recent
Best Picture nominations

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:12.359
found that only 12 percent
of speaking or named characters

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:13.889
were age 60 and up,

00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:16.534
and many of them
were portrayed as impaired.

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:19.067
Older people can be
the most ageist of all,

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.335
because we've had a lifetime
to internalize these messages

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:24.839
and we've never thought to challenge them.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.349
I had to acknowledge it

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:27.697
and stop colluding.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.324
"Senior moment" quips, for example:

00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:32.372
I stopped making them when it dawned on me

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:34.514
that when I lost
the car keys in high school,

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.274
I didn't call it a "junior moment."

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:38.735
(Laughter)

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.886
I stopped blaming
my sore knee on being 64.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.454
My other knee doesn't hurt,

00:04:43.478 --> 00:04:44.954
and it's just as old.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:46.990
(Laughter)

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:48.307
(Applause)

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.269
We are all worried about
some aspect of getting older,

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.881
whether running out of money,

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.282
getting sick, ending up alone,

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:57.769
and those fears are legitimate and real.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.976
But what never dawns on most of us

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.110
is that the experience of reaching old age

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.745
can be better or worse
depending on the culture

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:06.276
in which it takes place.

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:10.031
It is not having a vagina
that makes life harder for women.

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:11.269
It's sexism.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:13.188
(Applause)

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.961
It's not loving a man that makes
life harder for gay guys.

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:17.284
It's homophobia.

00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:20.896
And it is not the passage of time
that makes getting older

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.509
so much harder than it has to be.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:23.862
It is ageism.

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:25.468
When labels are hard to read

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.833
or there's no handrail

00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:28.517
or we can't open the damn jar,

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.915
we blame ourselves,

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.303
our failure to age successfully,

00:05:32.327 --> 00:05:36.321
instead of the ageism that makes
those natural transitions shameful

00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:39.865
and the discrimination that makes
those barriers acceptable.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:42.505
You can't make money off satisfaction,

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.207
but shame and fear create markets,

00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:47.739
and capitalism always needs new markets.

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.080
Who says wrinkles are ugly?

00:05:50.104 --> 00:05:52.857
The multi-billion-dollar
skin care industry.

00:05:53.302 --> 00:05:57.171
Who says perimenopause and low T
and mild cognitive impairment

00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:58.488
are medical conditions?

00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:00.902
The trillion-dollar
pharmaceutical industry.

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:01.957
(Cheers)

00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:04.111
The more clearly we see
these forces at work,

00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:07.415
the easier it is to come up
with alternative, more positive

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.553
and more accurate narratives.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:14.880
Aging is not a problem to be fixed
or a disease to be cured.

00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:19.744
It is a natural, powerful,
lifelong process that unites us all.

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:24.846
Changing the culture is a tall order,
I know that, but culture is fluid.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.185
Look at how much the position
of women has changed in my lifetime

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.734
or the incredible strides
that the gay rights movement

00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:32.820
has made in just a few decades, right?

00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:33.868
(Applause)

00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:35.359
Look at gender.

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:38.040
We used to think of it
as a binary, male or female,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.230
and now we understand it's a spectrum.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.848
It is high time to ditch
the old-young binary, too.

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.522
There is no line in the sand
between old and young,

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:48.498
after which it's all downhill.

00:06:48.522 --> 00:06:50.783
And the longer we wait
to challenge that idea,

00:06:50.807 --> 00:06:54.845
the more damage it does
to ourselves and our place in the world,

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:58.218
like in the workforce,
where age discrimination is rampant.

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:02.091
In Silicon Valley, engineers
are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged

00:07:02.115 --> 00:07:03.443
before key interviews --

00:07:03.467 --> 00:07:05.948
and these are skilled
white men in their 30s,

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:08.444
so imagine the effects
further down the food chain.

00:07:08.468 --> 00:07:10.630
(Laughter)

00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:14.025
The personal and economic
consequences are devastating.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:18.195
Not one stereotype about older workers
holds up under scrutiny.

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.297
Companies aren't adaptable and creative
because their employees are young;

00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:24.593
they're adaptable and creative despite it.

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:26.449
Companies --

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:27.537
(Laughter)

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.153
(Applause)

00:07:30.177 --> 00:07:33.255
We know that diverse companies
aren't just better places to work;

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.464
they work better.

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:38.166
And just like race and sex,
age is a criterion for diversity.

00:07:39.053 --> 00:07:41.089
A growing body of fascinating research

00:07:41.113 --> 00:07:42.806
shows that attitudes towards aging

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.356
affect how our minds and bodies
function at the cellular level.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.226
When we talk to older people
like this (Speaks more loudly)

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.225
or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" --

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:52.576
it's called elderspeak --

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.603
they appear to instantly age,

00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:57.036
walking and talking less competently.

00:07:57.575 --> 00:07:59.867
People with more positive
feelings towards aging

00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:01.063
walk faster,

00:08:01.087 --> 00:08:02.674
they do better on memory tests,

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.331
they heal quicker, and they live longer.

00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:08.631
Even with brains
full of plaques and tangles,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.635
some people stayed sharp to the end.

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:12.829
What did they have in common?

00:08:12.853 --> 00:08:14.159
A sense of purpose.

00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:17.661
And what's the biggest obstacle
to having a sense of purpose in late life?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:21.803
A culture that tells us that getting older
means shuffling offstage.

00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:24.598
That's why the World Health
Organization is developing

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:26.210
a global anti-ageism initiative

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:29.553
to extend not just
life span but health span.

00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:32.083
Women experience the double whammy

00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:33.747
of ageism and sexism,

00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:35.912
so we experience aging differently.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.147
There's a double standard
at work here -- shocker --

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.439
(Laughter)

00:08:40.463 --> 00:08:44.137
the notion that aging enhances men
and devalues women.

00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:48.962
Women reinforce this double standard
when we compete to stay young,

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:51.637
another punishing and losing proposition.

00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:54.381
Does any woman in this room really believe

00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:56.391
that she is a lesser version --

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:59.811
less interesting, less fun in bed,
less valuable --

00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:01.826
than the woman she once was?

00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:04.318
This discrimination affects our health,

00:09:04.342 --> 00:09:06.071
our well-being and our income,

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:08.283
and the effects add up over time.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.231
They are further compounded
by race and by class,

00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:13.467
which is why, everywhere in the world,

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:16.194
the poorest of the poor
are old women of color.

00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:19.485
What's the takeaway from that map?

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.917
By 2050, one out of five of us,

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.687
almost two billion people,

00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:25.733
will be age 60 and up.

00:09:25.757 --> 00:09:29.228
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark
of human progress.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:34.486
All these older people represent a vast
unprecedented and untapped market.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:39.181
And yet, capitalism and urbanization
have propelled age bias

00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:41.244
into every corner of the globe,

00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:43.686
from Switzerland,
where elders fare the best,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.696
to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom
of the Global AgeWatch Index.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.581
Half of the world's countries
aren't mentioned on that list

00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:55.197
because we don't bother to collect data
on millions of people

00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:56.905
because they're no longer young.

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.430
Almost two-thirds of people
over 60 around the world

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:03.029
say they have trouble
accessing healthcare.

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:06.860
Almost three-quarters say their income
doesn't cover basic services

00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:10.641
like food, water, electricity,
and decent housing.

00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:15.245
Is this the world we want our children,
who may well live to be a hundred,

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:16.530
to inherit?

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:20.569
Everyone -- all ages,
all genders, all nationalities --

00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:22.805
is old or future-old,

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.694
and unless we put an end to it,
ageism will oppress us all.

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.112
And that makes it a perfect target
for collective advocacy.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:35.304
Why add another -ism to the list
when so many, racism in particular,

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:37.116
call out for action?

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.373
Here's the thing:

00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.167
we don't have to choose.

00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:42.886
When we make the world
a better place to grow old in,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.051
we make it a better place
in which to be from somewhere else,

00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:47.609
to have a disability,

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:50.737
to be queer, to be non-rich,
to be non-white.

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:55.686
And when we show up at all ages
for whatever cause matters most to us --

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.435
save the whales, save the democracy --

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.989
we not only make
that effort more effective,

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:03.516
we dismantle ageism in the process.

00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:06.353
Longevity is here to stay.

00:11:06.377 --> 00:11:08.888
A movement to end ageism is underway.

00:11:08.912 --> 00:11:11.858
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:16.033
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:20.760
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!

00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:24.102
(Applause)
