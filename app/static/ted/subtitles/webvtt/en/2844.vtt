00:00:01.573 --> 00:00:04.207
The philosopher Plato once said,

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:06.980
"Music gives a soul to the universe,

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.598
wings to the mind,

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:10.644
flight to the imagination

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:12.626
and life to everything."

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:16.081
Music has always been
a big part of my life.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.475
To create and to perform music

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.344
connects you to people
countries and lifetimes away.

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:24.130
It connects you to the people
you're playing with,

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:25.342
to your audience

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.693
and to yourself.

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:29.283
When I'm happy, when I'm sad,

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.507
when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.101
I listen to and I create music.

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.987
When I was younger, I played piano;

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.408
later, I took up guitar.

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.265
And as I started high school,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.203
music became a part of my identity.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.926
I was in every band,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.576
I was involved with every
musical fine arts event.

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:49.565
Music surrounded me.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.944
It made me who I was,

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.078
and it gave me a place to belong.

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:56.753
Now, I've always had
this thing with rhythms.

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:57.946
I remember being young,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.034
I would walk down
the hallways of my school

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:03.048
and I would tap rhythms to myself
on my leg with my hands,

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:04.792
or tapping my teeth.

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:07.163
It was a nervous habit,

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:08.470
and I was always nervous.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.126
I think I liked the repetition
of the rhythm --

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.510
it was calming.

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:15.107
Then in high school,

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.644
I started music theory,

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:18.898
and it was the best class I've ever taken.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.456
We were learning about music --

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.169
things I didn't know,
like theory and history.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.236
It was a class where we basically
just listened to a song,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.888
talked about what it meant to us

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.098
and analyzed it,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.588
and figured out what made it tick.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.770
Every Wednesday, we did something
called "rhythmic dictation,"

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.196
and I was pretty good at it.

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.027
Our teacher would give us
an amount of measures

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:42.544
and a time signature,

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.432
and then he would speak a rhythm to us

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.872
and we would have to write it down
with the proper rests and notes.

00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:49.683
Like this:

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.099
ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.676
ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.

00:01:56.832 --> 00:01:58.137
And I loved it.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.639
The simplicity of the rhythm --

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.821
a basic two- to four- measure line --

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:04.649
and yet each of them almost told a story,

00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:07.904
like they had so much potential,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.444
and all you had to do was add a melody.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.482
(Guitar)

00:02:21.588 --> 00:02:25.587
Rhythms set a foundation for melodies
and harmonies to play on top of.

00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:28.165
It gives structure and stability.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.200
Now, music has these parts --

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:33.359
rhythm, melody and harmony --

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:34.864
just like our lives.

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:37.588
Where music has rhythm,

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.866
we have routines and habits --

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.155
things that help us to remember
what to do and to stay on track,

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.058
and to just keep going.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.055
And you may not notice it,

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.402
but it's always there.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.035
(Guitar)

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.876
And it may seem simple,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.597
it may seem dull by itself,

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.901
but it gives tempo and heartbeat.

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.056
And then things in your life add on to it,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.291
giving texture --

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:09.659
that's your friends and your family,

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:13.319
and anything that creates
a harmonic structure in your life

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:14.928
and in your song,

00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:16.614
like harmonies,

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:17.795
cadences

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.115
and anything that makes it polyphonic.

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:24.765
And they create beautiful
chords and patterns.

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.374
(Guitar)

00:03:27.354 --> 00:03:28.943
And then there's you.

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.351
You play on top of everything else,

00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:36.335
on top of the rhythms and the beat

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.488
because you're the melody.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.335
And things may change and develop,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:46.786
but no matter what we do,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.428
we're still the same people.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.291
Throughout a song melodies develop,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.015
but it's still the same song.

00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:57.037
No matter what you do,

00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:58.987
the rhythms are still there:

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.137
the tempo and the heartbeat ...

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.660
until I left,

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:08.744
and I went to college

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:10.241
and everything disappeared.

00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:14.810
When I first arrived at university,

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.059
I felt lost.

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.744
And don't get me wrong --
sometimes I loved it and it was great,

00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:21.148
but other times,

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.633
I felt like I had been left alone

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.387
to fend for myself.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:31.417
It's like I had been taken out
of my natural environment,

00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.786
and put somewhere new,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.642
where the rhythms and the harmonies

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.323
and the form had gone away,

00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.007
and it was just me --

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.356
(Guitar)

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.653
silence and my melody.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.425
And even that began to waver,

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.401
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:04:53.074 --> 00:04:55.470
I didn't have any chords
to structure myself,

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.547
or a rhythm

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.967
or a beat to know the tempo.

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:03.461
(Guitar)

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:05.797
And then I began to hear
all these other sounds.

00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:07.167
(Guitar)

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.479
And they were off-time

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.134
and off-key.

00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:16.512
And the more I was around them,

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.869
the more my melody started
to sound like theirs.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.427
And slowly I began to lose myself,

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:29.957
like I was being washed away.

00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:34.681
But then the next moment --

00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:36.691
(Guitar)

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:38.208
I could hear it.

00:05:39.634 --> 00:05:41.055
And I could feel it.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.502
And it was me.

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:46.690
And I was here.

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:49.269
And it was different,

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.234
but not worse off.

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.695
Just changed a little.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.811
Music is my way of coping
with the changes in my life.

00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:07.087
There's a beautiful connection
between music and life.

00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:08.793
It can bind us to reality

00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:11.209
at the same time
it allows us to escape it.

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:13.753
Music is something
that lives inside of you.

00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:16.427
You create it and you're created by it.

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:20.839
Our lives are not only conducted by music,

00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:22.494
they're also composed of it.

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:25.640
So this may seem like a bit of a stretch,

00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:27.231
but hear me out:

00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:30.845
music is a fundamental part of what we are

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.342
and of everything around us.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.696
Now, music is my passion,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.147
but physics also used to be
an interest of mine.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:38.806
And the more I learned,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.059
the more I saw connections
between the two --

00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:43.549
especially regarding string theory.

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:48.013
I know this is only one of many theories,

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:49.543
but it spoke to me.

00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:55.287
So, one aspect of string theory,
at its simplest form, is this:

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.337
matter is made up of atoms,

00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:00.579
which are made up of protons
and neutrons and electrons,

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:02.329
which are made up of quark.

00:07:02.353 --> 00:07:04.386
And here's where the string part comes in.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.941
This quark is supposedly made up
of little coiled strings,

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:12.884
and it's the vibrations of these strings
that make everything what it is.

00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:15.302
Michio Kaku once explained this

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:18.258
in a lecture called,
"The Universe in a Nutshell,"

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:19.657
where he says,

00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:22.744
"String theory is the simple idea

00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:24.796
that the four forces of the universe --

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.006
gravity, the electromagnetic force,
and the two strong forces --

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.005
can be viewed as music.

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:33.724
The music of tiny little rubber bands."

00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:36.939
In this lecture, he goes on
to explain physics

00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:39.372
as the laws of harmony
between these strings;

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.433
chemistry, as the melodies
you can play on these strings;

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:47.258
and he states that the universe
is a "symphony of strings."

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:51.507
These strings dictate the universe;

00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:54.064
they make up everything we see
and everything we know.

00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:56.298
They're musical notes,

00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:59.059
but they make us what we are
and they hold us together.

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:01.629
So you see,

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.828
everything is music.

00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:05.835
(Guitar)

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:07.989
When I look at the world,

00:08:08.013 --> 00:08:11.344
I see music all around us.

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:14.803
When I look at myself,

00:08:15.814 --> 00:08:17.280
I see music.

00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:23.524
And my life has been defined by music.

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:27.102
I found myself through music.

00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.824
Music is everywhere,

00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:33.422
and it is in everything.

00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.197
And it changes and it builds

00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:40.697
and it diminishes.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.991
But it's always there,

00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.405
supporting us,

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:48.127
connecting us to each other

00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:51.383
and showing us the beauty of the universe.

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:54.646
So if you ever feel lost,

00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:57.539
stop and listen for your song.

00:08:58.541 --> 00:08:59.823
Thank you.

00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:03.702
(Applause)
