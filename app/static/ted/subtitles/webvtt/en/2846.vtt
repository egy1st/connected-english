WEBVTT

00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:04.484
The youthful perspective on the future,

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:07.662
the present perspective on the future

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:12.233
and the future, mature
perspective on the future --

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.778
I'd like to try and bring
all those three tenses together

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.931
in one identity tonight.

00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:22.762
And you could say
that the poet, in many ways,

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:26.578
looks at what I call
"the conversational nature of reality."

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:28.858
And you ask yourself:

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.113
What is the conversational
nature of reality?

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:34.455
The conversational nature
of reality is the fact

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.649
that whatever you desire of the world --

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.077
whatever you desire of your partner
in a marriage or a love relationship,

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:44.108
whatever you desire of your children,

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:47.945
whatever you desire of the people
who work for you or with you,

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.317
or your world --

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:53.823
will not happen exactly
as you would like it to happen.

00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.019
But equally,

00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:58.335
whatever the world desires of us --

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.334
whatever our partner,
our child, our colleague,

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:03.547
our industry,

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.258
our future demands of us,

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.976
will also not happen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.953
And what actually happens

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:14.357
is this frontier
between what you think is you

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.217
and what you think is not you.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:19.378
And this frontier of actual meeting

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.496
between what we call a self
and what we call the world

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.238
is the only place, actually,
where things are real.

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.250
But it's quite astonishing,

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:31.455
how little time we spend
at this conversational frontier,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:37.138
and not abstracted away from it
in one strategy or another.

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:42.377
I was coming through immigration,

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.901
which is quite a dramatic
border at the moment,

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:48.382
into the US last year,

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.371
and, you know, you get off
an international flight

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.547
across the Atlantic,

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.266
and you're not in the best place;

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.843
you're not at your most
spiritually mature.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:00.132
You're quite impatient
with the rest of humanity, in fact.

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:04.531
So when you get up to immigration
with your shirt collar out

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:06.044
and a day's growth of beard,

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:09.407
and you have very little patience,

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.159
and the immigration officer
looked at my passport

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:14.291
and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:19.457
I said, "I work with the conversational
nature of reality."

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:23.392
(Laughter)

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:27.233
And he leaned forward over his podium

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.187
and he said, "I needed you last night."

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.599
(Laughter)

00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:34.927
(Applause)

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:37.513
And I said, "I'm sorry,

00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:40.620
my powers as a poet
and philosopher only go so far.

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:41.857
I'm not sure I can --"

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:43.418
But before we knew it,

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:46.872
we were into a conversation
about his marriage.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:48.569
Here he was in his uniform,

00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:50.061
and the interesting thing was,

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.298
he was looking up and down
the row of officers

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:55.351
to make sure his supervisor didn't see

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.865
that we was having a real conversation.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:02.073
But all of us live
at this conversational frontier

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:04.185
with the future.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.963
I'd like to put you in the shoes
of my Irish niece,

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.738
Marlene McCormack,

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:13.206
standing on a cliff edge
on the western coast of Spain,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.237
overlooking the broad Atlantic.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.018
Twenty-three years old,
she's just walked 500 miles

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.624
from Saint Jean Pied de Port
on the French side of the Pyrenees,

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:24.425
all the way across Northern Spain,

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.460
on this very famous,
old and contemporary pilgrimage

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:32.019
called the Camino de Santiago
de Compostela --

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:34.959
the Path to Santiago of Compostela.

00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:39.431
And when you get to Santiago, actually,

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:41.230
it can be something of an anticlimax,

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.576
because there are 100,000
people living there

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.791
who are not necessarily applauding you
as you're coming into town.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:47.816
(Laughter)

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.167
And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you
a memento of your journey.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:58.306
But you do have the possibility
of going on for three more days

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.725
to this place where Marlene stood,
called, in Spanish, Finisterre,

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.726
in English, Finisterre,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.167
from the Latin,
meaning "the ends of the earth,"

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:13.238
the place where ground turns to ocean;

00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:17.647
the place where your present
turns into the future.

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.256
And Marlene had walked this way --

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.974
she just graduated as a 23-year-old
from the University of Sligo

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:26.375
with a degree in Irish drama.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.791
And she said to me, "I don't think
the major corporations of the world

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:31.220
will be knocking on my door."

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:34.316
I said, "Listen, I've worked
in corporations all over the world

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.493
for decades;

00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:39.244
a degree in drama is what would most
prepare you for the adult --

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:40.285
(Laughter)

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.464
corporate world."

00:04:41.488 --> 00:04:43.028
(Applause)

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.111
But she said, "I'm not
interested in that, anyway.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.758
I don't want to teach drama,
I want to become a dramatist.

00:04:49.782 --> 00:04:51.414
I want to write plays.

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:56.623
So I walked the Camino
in order to give myself some courage,

00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:58.826
in order to walk into my future."

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.496
And I said, "What was the most powerful
moment you had on the whole Camino,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.064
the very most powerful moment?"

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.996
She said, "I had many powerful moments,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.040
but you know, the most powerful
moment was post-Camino,

00:05:10.064 --> 00:05:14.316
was the three days you go on from Santiago
and come to this cliff edge.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.956
And you go through three rituals.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.601
The first ritual is to eat
a tapas plate of scallops" --

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.190
or if you're vegetarian,

00:05:22.214 --> 00:05:24.667
to contemplate the scallop shell.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.142
(Laughter)

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:30.454
Because the scallop shell has been
the icon and badge of your walk,

00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:33.255
and every arrow
that you have seen along that way

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.344
has been pointing underneath
a scallop shell.

00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:39.453
So really, this first ritual is saying:

00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:41.385
How did you get to this place?

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.245
How did you follow the path to get here?

00:05:44.963 --> 00:05:50.085
How do you hold the conversation of life
when you feel unbesieged,

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:51.267
when you're unbullied,

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:52.699
when you're left to yourself?

00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:57.636
How do you hold the conversation of life
that brings you to this place?

00:05:58.217 --> 00:06:02.629
And the second ritual is that you burn
something that you've brought.

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:05.610
I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:08.074
She said, "I burned a letter
and two postcards."

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.812
I said, "Astonishing.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.880
Twenty-three years old and you have paper.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.080
I can't believe it."

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.414
(Laughter)

00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:16.089
I'm sure there's a Camino app

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:20.521
where you can just delete
a traumatic text, you know?

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:22.077
(Laughter)

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.117
It will engage the flashlight,

00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.773
imbue it with color

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.941
and disappear in a firework of flames.

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:33.340
But you either bring a letter
or you write one there,

00:06:33.364 --> 00:06:34.537
and you burn it.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.905
And of course we know intuitively
what is on those letters and postcards.

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:44.621
It's a form of affection and love
that is now no longer extant, yeah?

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:47.993
And then the third ritual:

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:53.631
between all these fires
are large piles of clothes.

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.858
And you leave an item of clothing

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:59.270
that has helped you to get to this place.

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:03.143
And I said to Marlene,
"What did you leave at the cliff edge?"

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:04.592
She said, "I left my boots --

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.767
the very things
that I walked in, actually.

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:09.266
They were beautiful boots,
I loved those boots,

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.276
but they were finished
after seven weeks of walking.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.825
So I walked away in my trainers,

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:15.136
but I left my boots there."

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.041
She said, "It was really incredible.

00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:21.449
The most powerful moment was,
the sun was going down,

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:24.179
but the full moon was coming up behind me.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.606
And the full moon was illuminated
by the dying sun in such a powerful way

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.308
that even after the sun
had dropped below the horizon,

00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:35.571
the moon could still see that sun.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.164
And I had a moon shadow,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.208
and I was looking at my moon shadow
walking across the Atlantic,

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.019
across this ocean.

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.765
And I thought,

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:51.385
'Oh! That's my new self
going into the future.'

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:57.394
But suddenly I realized
the sun was falling further.

00:07:57.418 --> 00:08:01.539
The moon was losing its reflection,

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:03.827
and my shadow was disappearing.

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.963
The most powerful moment
I had on the whole Camino

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:12.975
was when I realized I myself
had to walk across that unknown sea

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:14.406
into my future."

00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:17.653
Well, I was so taken by this story,

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:19.002
I wrote this piece for her.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.531
We were driving at the time;

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.228
we got home, I sat on the couch,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.029
I wrote until two in the morning --

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:25.447
everyone had gone to bed --

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.318
and I gave it to Marlene
at breakfast time.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.513
It's called, "Finisterre,"
for Marlene McCormack.

00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:35.728
"The road in the end

00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:40.484
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:44.199
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.617
into the western sea

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:49.606
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.488
into the western sea

00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:52.679
and the moon

00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:54.989
the moon rising behind you

00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:59.371
as you stood where ground turned to ocean:

00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:01.303
no way to your future now

00:09:01.327 --> 00:09:02.519
no way to your future now

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:05.306
except the way your shadow could take,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.643
walking before you across water,
going where shadows go,

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:13.493
no way to make sense of a world
that wouldn't let you pass

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:17.232
except to call an end
to the way you had come,

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:23.561
to take out each letter you had brought

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.050
and light their illumined corners;

00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:31.158
and to read them as they drifted
on the late western light;

00:09:31.182 --> 00:09:32.387
to empty your bags

00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:33.964
to empty your bags;

00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:36.717
to sort this and to leave that

00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:39.082
to sort this and to leave that;

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:44.345
to promise what you needed
to promise all along

00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:47.205
to promise what you needed
to promise all along,

00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:51.913
and to abandon the shoes
that brought you here

00:09:51.937 --> 00:09:53.786
right at the water's edge,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.371
not because you had given up

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:57.016
not because you had given up

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.881
but because now,

00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:01.088
you would find a different way to tread,

00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:02.855
and because, through it all,

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.280
part of you would still walk on,

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.788
no matter how,

00:10:06.812 --> 00:10:08.364
over the waves."

00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:11.946
"Finisterre."

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.324
For Marlene McCormack --

00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:19.689
(Applause)

00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:25.837
who has already had
her third play performed

00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:28.976
in off-off-off-off-Broadway --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.165
in Dublin.

00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:31.202
(Laughter)

00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.600
But she's on her way.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.365
This is the last piece.

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:41.511
This is about the supposed arrival
at the sum of all of our endeavors.

00:10:41.922 --> 00:10:43.334
In Santiago itself --

00:10:43.358 --> 00:10:44.596
it could be Santiago,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.925
it could be Mecca,

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:47.117
it could be Varanasi,

00:10:47.141 --> 00:10:48.703
it could be Kyoto,

00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:52.994
it could be that threshold
you've set for yourself,

00:10:53.588 --> 00:11:00.348
the disturbing approach
to the consummation of all your goals.

00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:05.681
And one of the difficulties
about walking into your life,

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:07.138
about coming into this body,

00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:09.533
into this world fully,

00:11:10.057 --> 00:11:11.998
is you start to realize

00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:18.329
that you have manufactured
three abiding illusions

00:11:18.353 --> 00:11:22.375
that the rest of humanity has shared
with you since the beginning of time.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:27.207
And the first illusion
is that you can somehow construct a life

00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.414
in which you are not vulnerable.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:35.471
You can somehow be immune
to all of the difficulties

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:39.679
and ill health and losses

00:11:39.703 --> 00:11:44.051
that humanity has been subject to
since the beginning of time.

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:45.791
If we look out at the natural world,

00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:47.319
there's no part of that world

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:51.295
that doesn't go through cycles
of, first, incipience,

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:52.521
or hiddenness,

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.974
but then growth, fullness,

00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:59.235
but then a beautiful,
to begin with, disappearance,

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.282
and then a very austere,
full disappearance.

00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.413
We look at that, we say,
"That's beautiful,

00:12:04.437 --> 00:12:08.710
but can I just have the first half
of the equation, please?

00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:10.729
And when the disappearance is happening,

00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:13.805
I'll close my eyes and wait
for the new cycle to come around."

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:17.821
Which means most human beings
are at war with reality

00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:19.653
50 percent of the time.

00:12:20.804 --> 00:12:25.601
The mature identity

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.859
is able to live in the full cycle.

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:30.536
The second illusion is,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.087
I can construct a life
in which I will not have my heart broken.

00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:37.750
Romance is the first place
we start to do it.

00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:41.198
When you're at the beginning
of a new romance or a new marriage,

00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:45.361
you say, "I have found the person
who will not break my heart."

00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:47.150
I'm sorry;

00:12:47.174 --> 00:12:52.572
you have chosen them out unconsciously
for that exact core competency.

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:53.906
(Laughter)

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.267
They will break your heart.

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:56.447
Why?

00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.081
Because you care about them.

00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:00.271
You look at parenting, yeah?

00:13:00.295 --> 00:13:03.423
Parenting: "I will be
the perfect mother and father."

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.362
Your children will break your heart.

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:10.140
And they don't even have to do
anything spectacular or dramatic.

00:13:11.077 --> 00:13:14.986
But usually, they do do something
spectacular or dramatic --

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.031
(Laughter)

00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:17.333
to break your heart.

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:21.471
And then they live with you
as spies and saboteurs for years,

00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:24.333
watching your every psychological move,

00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:27.055
and spotting your every weakness.

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:28.245
And one day,

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:30.397
when they're about 14 years old,

00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:31.891
with your back turned to them,

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:33.159
in the kitchen,

00:13:33.183 --> 00:13:35.346
while you're making something for them --

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.378
(Laughter)

00:13:36.402 --> 00:13:38.909
the psychological stiletto goes in.

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:41.968
(Laughter)

00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:45.273
(Applause)

00:13:46.682 --> 00:13:50.752
And you say, "How did you know
exactly where to place it?"

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:51.791
(Laughter)

00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:52.974
And they say,

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.523
"I've been watching you for --

00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:55.558
(Laughter)

00:13:55.582 --> 00:13:56.928
a good few years."

00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:05.072
And then we hope that our armored,
professional personalities

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:08.232
will prevent us from having our
heart broken in work.

00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.270
But if you're sincere about your work,

00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:13.587
it should break your heart.

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.961
You should get to thresholds

00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:19.504
where you do not know how to proceed.

00:14:20.032 --> 00:14:23.388
You do not know how to get
from here to there.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:25.963
What does that do?

00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:29.239
It puts you into a proper
relationship with reality.

00:14:29.263 --> 00:14:30.413
Why?

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.264
Because you have to ask for help.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.347
Heartbreak.

00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:42.483
We don't have a choice about heartbreak,

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:46.482
we only have a choice
of having our hearts broken

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:51.936
over people and things and projects
that we deeply care about.

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:55.472
And the last illusion is,

00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:59.933
I can somehow plan enough
and arrange things

00:14:59.957 --> 00:15:03.572
that I will be able to see
the path to the end

00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:05.270
right from where I'm standing,

00:15:05.294 --> 00:15:06.928
right to the horizon.

00:15:08.221 --> 00:15:10.024
But when you think about it,

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:13.447
the only environment
in which that would be true

00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:15.914
would be a flat desert,

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:19.459
empty of any other life.

00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:22.658
But even in a flat desert,

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:25.960
the curvature of the earth
would take the path away from you.

00:15:26.764 --> 00:15:28.318
So, no;

00:15:28.342 --> 00:15:29.957
you see the path,

00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:31.863
and then you don't

00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:33.822
and then you see it again.

00:15:33.846 --> 00:15:35.966
So this is "Santiago,"

00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:38.777
the supposed arrival,

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:43.160
which is a kind of return
to the beginning all at the same time.

00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:46.134
We have this experience of the journey,

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.864
which is in all of our great
spiritual traditions,

00:15:48.888 --> 00:15:50.041
of pilgrimage.

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:54.335
But just by actually standing
in the ground of your life fully,

00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:58.449
not trying to abstract yourself
into a strategic future

00:15:58.473 --> 00:16:02.130
that's actually just an escape
from present heartbreak;

00:16:02.154 --> 00:16:04.963
the ability to stand
in the ground of your life

00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:08.376
and to look at the horizon
that is pulling you --

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.718
in that moment,

00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:11.220
you are the whole journey.

00:16:11.244 --> 00:16:13.599
You are the whole conversation.

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:16.893
"Santiago."

00:16:16.917 --> 00:16:19.899
"The road seen, then not seen

00:16:19.923 --> 00:16:23.258
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.754
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take

00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:31.528
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:31.552 --> 00:16:36.628
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take,

00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:40.302
the road dropping away from you

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:45.076
as if leaving you to walk on thin air,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.275
then catching you,

00:16:46.299 --> 00:16:47.539
catching you,

00:16:47.563 --> 00:16:50.388
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:16:50.412 --> 00:16:51.575
catching you,

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:53.935
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:55.505
and the way forward

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:59.136
the way forward always in the end

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.697
the way that you came,

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:02.598
the way forward always in the end

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:03.778
the way that you came,

00:17:03.802 --> 00:17:07.136
the way that you followed,
the way that carried you into your future,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.880
that brought you to this place,

00:17:08.904 --> 00:17:11.367
that brought you to this place,

00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:16.649
no matter that it sometimes
had to take your promise from you,

00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:21.988
no matter that it always
had to break your heart along the way:

00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:23.878
the sense

00:17:23.902 --> 00:17:28.501
the sense of having walked
from deep inside yourself

00:17:28.525 --> 00:17:30.687
out into the revelation,

00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:33.224
to have risked yourself

00:17:33.248 --> 00:17:39.218
for something that seemed to stand
both inside you and far beyond you,

00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:41.739
and that called you back in the end

00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:44.403
to the only road you could follow,

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:48.780
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:51.696
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:58.641
and speaking in the voice that by night
became a prayer for safe arrival,

00:17:58.665 --> 00:18:00.392
so that one day

00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:02.533
one day you realized

00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:06.040
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:08.016
one day you realized

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.397
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:10.421 --> 00:18:11.572
and long ago

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:15.573
and in the dwelling place
in which you lived before you began,

00:18:15.597 --> 00:18:16.753
and that

00:18:16.777 --> 00:18:19.393
and that every step along the way,

00:18:19.417 --> 00:18:21.064
every step along the way,

00:18:21.088 --> 00:18:24.915
you had carried the heart
and the mind and the promise

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:27.826
that first set you off
and then drew you on,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.013
and that

00:18:29.037 --> 00:18:33.910
and that you were more marvelous

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:36.198
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:40.199
you were more marvelous
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:44.460
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach

00:18:44.484 --> 00:18:48.221
you were more marvelous
in that simple wish to find a way

00:18:48.245 --> 00:18:51.151
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach:

00:18:51.175 --> 00:18:52.352
as if, all along,

00:18:52.376 --> 00:18:55.469
you had thought the end point
might be a city with golden domes,

00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:56.948
and cheering crowds,

00:18:56.972 --> 00:18:58.919
and turning the corner

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:03.290
at what you thought
was the end of the road,

00:19:03.314 --> 00:19:06.427
you found just a simple reflection,

00:19:07.395 --> 00:19:10.972
and a clear revelation
beneath the face looking back

00:19:10.996 --> 00:19:15.324
and beneath it another invitation,

00:19:15.348 --> 00:19:17.747
all in one glimpse

00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:19.418
all in one glimpse:

00:19:19.442 --> 00:19:20.672
like a person

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:25.146
like a person or a place
you had sought forever

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.657
like a person or a place
you had sought forever,

00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:33.008
like a bold field of freedom
that beckoned you beyond;

00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:34.389
like another life

00:19:34.413 --> 00:19:36.198
like another life,

00:19:36.222 --> 00:19:37.489
and the road

00:19:37.513 --> 00:19:40.805
the road still stretching on."

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.543
(Applause)

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:44.721
Thank you.

00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:47.822
(Applause)

00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:50.530
Thank you.

00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:53.554
(Applause)
