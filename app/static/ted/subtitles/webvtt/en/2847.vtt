WEBVTT

00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.380
Are you tired of your boss?

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:04.429
(Laughter)

00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:06.294
Are you tired of going to work

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.751
and making money for other people?

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.541
And who are those people anyways?

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.644
Those people that make
money from your work.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:16.276
Well, they're capitalists.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.576
They have capital,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.267
and they use your labor
to make more capital.

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:23.047
So if you're tired of going to work

00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.276
and making money for other people,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.968
then you're probably like me --

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.759
just tired of capitalism.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.823
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:34.265
(Laughter)

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.012
I own a small business --

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.560
Rco Tires in Compton.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:40.547
A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:43.489
and he wrote, "Let's make
green collar jobs in the hood,"

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:45.557
I took him really seriously.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:49.788
So I cofounded, own and operate
a tire recycling company,

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:51.774
and I'm really proud of what we've done.

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:55.171
So far, we've recycled
a hundred million pounds of rubber.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:59.607
That's 21 million gallons of oil
diverted from landfills

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.795
into new products.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:02.385
(Cheers)

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.058
We also employ about 15 guys --

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.197
mostly people of color,

00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:07.591
most of whom are felons,

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:09.490
and we pay above the minimum wage,

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:12.456
and we are now proud members
of the United Steelworkers Union.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:18.507
(Applause)

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:21.070
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.761
It's a privately held company
with community-minded ownership,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.539
but I would like it to become one.

00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:28.858
I would like for them to fire the boss --

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.221
that's me.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:31.293
(Laughter)

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:32.763
And I'm going to tell you why,

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:35.109
but first, let me tell you
how we got started.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.013
So a lot of people ask,

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:38.471
"How did Rco come to be?"

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.033
And I have to be really honest.

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:42.424
I leveraged my white privilege.

00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:46.417
So, here's how white privilege
worked for me and Rco.

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:51.293
My white grandmother
was born on her family's plantation

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:53.971
in Arkansas in 1918.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:56.925
She traveled with her white father west,

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.518
following the oil boom.

00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:01.722
And he held various union oil jobs --

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.207
jobs which would have never been given
to my black great-grandfather,

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.761
had he lived here at the time.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.671
Granny became a hairdresser

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.600
and then got a loan with her husband

00:02:13.624 --> 00:02:15.694
who built their home
in West Los Angeles --

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.196
a loan which would never have been
given to a black family at the time.

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.257
And after my grandfather passed away,

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.060
my granny was able to keep that house

00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:26.761
because she had his pension
and his health care

00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:28.553
from a state job which he held,

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:31.199
which again, would have never been
given to a black man

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:33.609
before the anti-discrimination
act of the 1960s.

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:35.906
So, you fast-forward 30 years,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.318
and I graduate,

00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:39.044
and I want to start my own business

00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:40.945
with a pile of debt and a credit card,

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.312
and no experience in the tire industry.

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:45.573
But I had what most people didn't have.

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:50.076
I had a clean, safe, free place to live.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.784
I moved in with my grandmother,

00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:55.133
and I was able to rent
our first warehouse,

00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:56.333
buy our first truck,

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:57.917
pay our first employees,

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.355
because I didn't have to worry
about paying myself,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.162
because I didn't need to feed myself,

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:05.727
because I am the direct beneficiary
of generations of white privilege.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:10.767
Now, telling the story
of white privilege is important

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.220
because very often people say,

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:14.102
"Oh, we want more companies like yours.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.284
We want more Rco's,

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:17.157
we want more black-owned businesses,

00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:19.845
female-led, triple bottom line,

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.041
Ban the Box,

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.027
green manufacturing companies," right?

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.382
But the question we have to ask is,
where is the wealth?

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.557
Where is the money?

00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:29.447
Where's the capital in our communities

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.630
to build the types
of businesses that we want?

00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:34.202
And in telling a story
of the white side of my family,

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.377
I needed a dozen ways

00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:37.462
where blacks were excluded
from the economy,

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:41.034
whereas the white side of my family
was able to gain access and traction,

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:42.454
and build wealth ...

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:47.834
Primarily because racism
and capitalism are best homies, but --

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:49.660
(Laughter)

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.137
but what that means
is that when we ask ourselves,

00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:54.622
"Why are our communities broke?" --

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.852
Like, we're not just broke
because we're broke;

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.211
we're broke for a reason.

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.351
Historical context really does matter.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.861
But our history
tells another story as well.

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:06.573
There's this incredible book
called "Collective Courage,"

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:09.813
which is the story of how
thousands of African Americans

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:12.357
have been able to build
businesses and schools,

00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.624
hospitals, farming cooperatives,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:16.365
banks, financial institutions --

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.001
entire communities
and sovereign economies,

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.447
without a lot of capital.

00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:22.954
And they did it by working together

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:25.385
and leveraging their community assets

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.861
and trusting each other

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:28.585
and putting solidarity first --

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:31.408
not just profits by any means necessary.

00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:35.693
And they didn't have to wait around
for celebrities and athletes

00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:38.003
to bring their money back to the hood.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.182
However, if you are
a celebrity or an athlete,

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:41.599
and you're listening to this,

00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:43.409
please feel free to bring your money.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.075
(Laughter)

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.267
But they did it
through cooperative economics,

00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:49.442
because they knew

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:52.574
that capitalism was never
going to finance black liberation.

00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:56.970
So, there are so many great
examples in this book,

00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:59.093
and I suggest that everybody just read it

00:04:59.117 --> 00:05:01.360
because it answers
the question I asked earlier,

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.688
which was where are we going
to get the wealth

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:05.788
to build the types
of business that we want.

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:08.660
And the answer is going to have
to be cooperative economics.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:11.644
There's a lot of different
versions of cooperativism.

00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:14.088
What I'm talking about today
is worker ownership.

00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:16.693
You may not have heard
of worker ownership,

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.327
but it's been an incredible tool

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.432
for black economic liberation
for a century,

00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:22.865
and it's also working
all over the world right now.

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:25.446
You may have heard of Black Wall Street

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.661
or maybe the Zapatistas,

00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:29.731
but I'll give you an example
that's a little bit closer to home.

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.272
Right now, today, in South Bronx,

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:35.493
is the country's largest
worker-owned company.

00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:38.186
It's called Cooperative
Home Care Associates,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.170
and it was founded by black
and Latinx home care workers

00:05:41.194 --> 00:05:44.267
who are now able
to pay themselves living wages,

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.546
they have full-time hours,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.198
they have benefits and a pension,

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.800
through their membership
as a unit of SEIU.

00:05:50.778 --> 00:05:54.626
And these women owners now receive
a dividend back on their ownership

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.943
every year that the company
has been profitable,

00:05:56.967 --> 00:05:58.347
which has been most years.

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.910
So they're able to really enjoy
the fruits of their labor

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.592
because they fired the boss.

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:06.968
They don't have any big investors.

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.600
They don't have fat-cat CEOs

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:11.680
or absentee owners taking
the profit out of the company.

00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:16.030
They each pay in
about 1,000 dollars over time

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:17.970
in order to gain ownership,

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.343
and now they own their job.

00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:23.583
Now, there's hundreds of more examples
of companies like this

00:06:23.607 --> 00:06:25.441
springing up all across the country.

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:28.714
And I'm so inspired by what they're doing,

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:31.223
because it really represents
an alternative

00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:33.278
to the type of economy we have now,

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:34.664
which exploits all of us.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.970
It also represents an alternative

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:40.954
to waiting around for big investors
to bring chain stores,

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.750
or big-box stores to our communities,

00:06:42.774 --> 00:06:45.050
because honestly,
those types of developments,

00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:47.398
they steal resources from our communities.

00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:50.259
They put our mom-and-pop shops
out of business,

00:06:50.283 --> 00:06:53.379
they make our entrepreneurs
into wage workers,

00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:55.209
and they take money out of our pocket

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:56.974
and send it to their shareholders.

00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:01.431
So, I was so inspired by all these stories
of resistance and resilience

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:04.223
that I got together with a few people
here in Los Angeles,

00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:05.627
and we created LUCI.

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:10.170
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles
Union Cooperative Initiative,

00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:13.290
and our objective is to create
more worker-owned businesses

00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:14.980
here in Los Angeles.

00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:17.362
So far, in the last year,
we've created two:

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:19.379
Pacific Electric, an electrical company,

00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:20.958
and Vermont Gage Carwash,

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.745
which is right here in South-Central,

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:24.801
some of you guys
might be familiar with it.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:29.496
This long-time carwash is now owned
and operated by its 20 workers,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.544
all of whom are union members as well.

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:36.804
(Applause)

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:40.726
So you might be wondering
why the focus on union-worker ownership,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.377
but there's a lot of good reasons

00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:46.151
why the labor movement is a natural ally
to the worker-ownership movement.

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:48.771
To build these companies
that we want in our community,

00:07:48.795 --> 00:07:49.946
we need a few things.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.568
We're going to need money,
people and training.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.779
Unions have all of those things.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.847
America's working class has been
paying union dues for decades,

00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.919
and with it, our unions have been building

00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:03.777
dignified, decent,
and democratic workplaces for us.

00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.226
However, union jobs
are on the steep decline,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.656
and it's time for us to start
calling on our unions

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.345
to really bring all of their financial
and political capital

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:16.052
to bear in the creation of new,
union, living-wage jobs

00:08:16.076 --> 00:08:17.289
in our communities.

00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:21.104
Also, union halls
are full of union members

00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:24.271
who understand
the importance of solidarity

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.416
and the power of collective action.

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:31.757
These are the types of folks that want
more union businesses to exist,

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.991
so let's build them with them.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:36.510
Learning from our unions,

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.685
learning from our past,

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:38.882
learning from our peers,

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:41.550
are all going to be very
important to our success,

00:08:41.574 --> 00:08:44.478
which is why I'd like to leave you
with one last example

00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.526
and a vision for the future ...

00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:49.981
and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.

00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:55.191
Mondragon, Spain is a community
built entirely around worker cooperatives.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.662
There's 260-plus businesses here,

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:03.463
manufacturing everything from bicycles
to washing machines to transformers.

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:07.562
And this group of businesses
now employs 80,000 people

00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:10.690
and earns more than 12 billion euros
in revenue every year.

00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:15.446
And all of the companies there
are owned by the people that work in them.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:20.612
They've also built universities
and hospitals and financial institutions.

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:24.505
I mean, imagine if we could build
something like this in South-Central.

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:29.114
The late mayor of Jackson
had a similar idea.

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:34.993
He wanted to turn his entire city
into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,

00:09:35.017 --> 00:09:37.926
calling his ambitious plan
"Jackson Rising."

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.366
And when I look at Mondragon,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.200
I see really what working-class people
can do for ourselves

00:09:43.224 --> 00:09:44.375
when we work together

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.955
and make decisions
for ourselves and each other

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:48.287
and our communities.

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:54.495
And what's really incredible
about Mondragon

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.986
is that while we are dreaming about them,

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.931
they are dreaming about us.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:04.325
This community in Spain has decided
to launch an international initiative

00:10:04.349 --> 00:10:07.351
to create more communities
like it all over the world,

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:08.982
by linking up with unions,

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.919
by supporting organizations like LUCI,

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.841
and by educating folks
about the worker-ownership model.

00:10:15.357 --> 00:10:17.872
Now, here's what you can do
to be a part of it.

00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:20.476
If you're a union member,
go to your union meetings,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.690
and make sure that your union
has a worker-ownership initiative,

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:24.864
and become a part of it.

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:26.631
If you're an entrepreneur,

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:28.075
if you have a small business,

00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:29.918
or you're interested in starting one,

00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:32.609
then link up with LUCI
or another organization like us

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.927
to help you get started
on the cooperative model.

00:10:35.258 --> 00:10:36.410
If you're a politician,

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:37.826
or you work for one,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.517
or you just like talking to them,

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:43.778
please get the city, state, federal
and county legislation passed

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:47.294
that we need in order to fund
and support worker-owned businesses.

00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:49.220
And for everybody else,

00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:51.483
learn about our history,
learn about our models,

00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:53.133
and seek us out so can support us,

00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:56.364
you can buy from us, invest in us,
lend to us and join us,

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:58.454
because it's really
going to take all of us

00:10:58.478 --> 00:11:02.098
in order to build the more just
and sustainable and resilient economy

00:11:02.122 --> 00:11:05.053
that we want for ourselves
and our children.

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.088
And with that,

00:11:07.112 --> 00:11:10.303
I would like to leave you
with a quote from Arundhati Roy,

00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:11.477
and she writes ...

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:16.698
"Our strategy should not be only
to confront Empire,

00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:18.340
but to lay siege to it.

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:20.791
To deprive it of oxygen.

00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:23.095
To mock it.

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:24.269
To shame it.

00:11:24.881 --> 00:11:26.096
With our art,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.294
our literature,

00:11:27.318 --> 00:11:28.582
our music,

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:29.756
our brilliance,

00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:31.461
our joy,

00:11:32.153 --> 00:11:33.899
our sheer relentlessness --

00:11:34.574 --> 00:11:36.708
and our ability to tell our own stories.

00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:39.936
Not the stories that we're being
brainwashed to believe.

00:11:41.729 --> 00:11:43.798
The corporate revolution will collapse

00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:46.052
if we refuse to buy
what they're selling --

00:11:47.236 --> 00:11:48.386
their ideas,

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:50.327
their version of history,

00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:51.502
their wars,

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:52.695
their weapons,

00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:54.758
their sense of inevitability.

00:11:55.956 --> 00:11:57.106
Because know this:

00:11:57.804 --> 00:11:59.682
They be few and we be many.

00:12:00.233 --> 00:12:02.119
They need us more than we need them.

00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:05.302
Another world is not only possible,

00:12:05.722 --> 00:12:06.872
she's on her way.

00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:08.849
And on a quiet day,

00:12:09.452 --> 00:12:10.793
I can hear her breathing."

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:12.479
Thank you.

00:12:12.503 --> 00:12:14.404
(Applause)
