00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:04.913
These are some photos of me
volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.129
in 2006.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.743
When these photos were taken,

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.069
I thought I was doing a really good thing

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.601
and that I was really helping those kids.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.425
I had a lot to learn.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.015
It all started for me
when I was 19 years old

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.401
and went backpacking
through Southeast Asia.

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:24.718
When I reached Cambodia,

00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:29.016
I felt uncomfortable being on holiday
surrounded by so much poverty

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.122
and wanted to do something to give back.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.593
So I visited some orphanages
and donated some clothes and books

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:36.911
and some money

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.714
to help the kids that I met.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.867
But one of the orphanages I visited
was desperately poor.

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.627
I had never encountered poverty
like that before in my life.

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.575
They didn't have funds for enough food,

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:51.909
clean water

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.259
or medical treatment,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.847
and the sad little faces on those kids

00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:58.073
were heartbreaking.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.401
So I was compelled
to do something more to help.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.922
I fund-raised in Australia and returned
to Cambodia the following year

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:08.423
to volunteer at the orphanage
for a few months.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.524
I taught English and bought
water filters and food

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:16.487
and took all of the kids to the dentist
for the first time in their lives.

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:19.400
But over the course of the next year,

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.008
I came to discover that this orphanage
that I had been supporting

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:24.465
was terribly corrupt.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:29.871
The director had been embezzling
every cent donated to the orphanage,

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:34.245
and in my absence, the children
were suffering such gross neglect

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.318
that they were forced to catch mice
to feed themselves.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:39.889
I also found out later

00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:43.647
that the director had been physically
and sexually abusing the kids.

00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.499
I couldn't bring myself
to turn my back on children

00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:50.185
who I had come to know and care about

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.489
and return to my life in Australia.

00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:56.698
So I worked with a local team
and the local authorities

00:01:56.722 --> 00:02:00.101
to set up a new orphanage
and rescue the kids

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.515
to give them a safe new home.

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:07.923
But this is where my story takes
another unexpected turn.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.005
As I adjusted to my new life
running an orphanage in Cambodia,

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:17.569
(Khmer) I learned
to speak Khmer fluently,

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:22.500
which means that I learned
to speak the Khmer language fluently.

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:25.575
And when I could communicate
properly with the kids,

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.830
I began to uncover some strange things.

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:33.362
Most of the children we had removed
from the orphanage

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:36.896
were not, in fact, orphans at all.

00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:39.490
They had parents,

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:43.918
and the few that were orphaned
had other living relatives,

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.462
like grandparents and aunties and uncles

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.062
and other siblings.

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:53.317
So why were these children
living in an orphanage

00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.687
when they weren't orphans?

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.511
Since 2005, the number
of orphanages in Cambodia

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.958
has risen by 75 percent,

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:06.871
and the number of children
living in Cambodian orphanages

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.041
has nearly doubled,

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:10.577
despite the fact

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.724
that the vast majority of children
living in these orphanages

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.730
are not orphans in the traditional sense.

00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:19.536
They're children from poor families.

00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.821
So if the vast majority of children
living in orphanages

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:25.268
are not orphans,

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:27.154
then the term "orphanage"

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:31.837
is really just a euphemistic name
for a residential care institution.

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.494
These institutions go
by other names as well,

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:41.003
like "shelters," "safe houses,"
"children's homes," "children's villages,"

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:42.593
even "boarding schools."

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.451
And this problem is not just
confined to Cambodia.

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:52.242
This map shows some of the countries
that have seen a dramatic increase

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.101
in the numbers of residential
care institutions

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.784
and the numbers of children
being institutionalized.

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:01.214
In Uganda, for example,

00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:03.827
the number of children
living in institutions

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:09.184
has increased by more than
1,600 percent since 1992.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:15.009
And the problems posed
by putting kids into institutions

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:19.708
don't just pertain to the corrupt
and abusive institutions

00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:22.387
like the one that I rescued the kids from.

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:26.548
The problems are with all forms
of residential care.

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:31.935
Over 60 years of international
research has shown us

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.275
that children who grow up in institutions,

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:38.243
even the very best institutions,

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:41.771
are at serious risk
of developing mental illnesses,

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:43.578
attachment disorders,

00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:45.833
growth and speech delays,

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:48.821
and many will struggle
with an inability to reintegrate

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:51.057
back into society later in life

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:53.748
and form healthy relationships as adults.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:58.014
These kids grow up
without any model of family

00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:00.485
or of what good parenting looks like,

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.648
so they then can struggle
to parent their own children.

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:08.901
So if you institutionalize
large numbers of children,

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:12.462
it will affect not only this generation,

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:14.941
but also the generations to come.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:19.530
We've learned these lessons
before in Australia.

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:23.886
It's what happened
to our "Stolen Generations,"

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.568
the indigenous children
who were removed from their families

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.013
with the belief
that we could do a better job

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.181
of raising their children.

00:05:33.962 --> 00:05:35.485
Just imagine for a moment

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.267
what residential care
would be like for a child.

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:42.181
Firstly, you have a constant
rotation of caregivers,

00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:45.359
with somebody new coming on
to the shift every eight hours.

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.122
And then on top of that
you have a steady stream of visitors

00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:50.908
and volunteers coming in,

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:54.125
showering you in the love
and affection you're craving

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.735
and then leaving again,

00:05:57.337 --> 00:06:00.239
evoking all of those feelings
of abandonment,

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:03.535
and proving again and again

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.998
that you are not worthy of being loved.

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:13.453
We don't have orphanages
in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.433
and for a very good reason:

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:19.924
one study has shown that young adults
raised in institutions

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:23.867
are 10 times more likely
to fall into sex work than their peers,

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:27.726
40 times more likely
to have a criminal record,

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:32.868
and 500 times more likely

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.771
to take their own lives.

00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:41.507
There are an estimated
eight million children around the world

00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.555
living in institutions like orphanages,

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:49.044
despite the fact that around
80 percent of them are not orphans.

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:52.784
Most have families
who could be caring for them

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.558
if they had the right support.

00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:57.492
But for me,

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.950
the most shocking thing of all to realize

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.157
is what's contributing to this boom

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:09.206
in the unnecessary institutionalization
of so many children:

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.608
it's us --

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:16.900
the tourists, the volunteers

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:18.869
and the donors.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:25.434
It's the well-meaning support
from people like me back in 2006,

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:29.327
who visit these children
and volunteer and donate,

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:34.450
who are unwittingly fueling an industry
that exploits children

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:36.570
and tears families apart.

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:41.719
It's really no coincidence
that these institutions are largely set up

00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:44.655
in areas where tourists
can most easily be lured in

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:49.052
to visit and volunteer
in exchange for donations.

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:53.358
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,

00:07:54.049 --> 00:07:58.829
over 90 percent of them are located
in the most popular tourist hotspots.

00:08:00.402 --> 00:08:02.615
The cold, hard truth is,

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.982
the more money that floods in
in support of these institutions,

00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:09.330
the more institutions open

00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:13.041
and the more children
are removed from their families

00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.578
to fill their beds.

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:18.657
It's just the laws of supply and demand.

00:08:20.614 --> 00:08:23.751
I had to learn all of these
lessons the hard way,

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:27.461
after I had already set up
an orphanage in Cambodia.

00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:31.683
I had to eat a big piece
of humble pie to admit

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.874
that I had made a mistake

00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:37.739
and inadvertently become
a part of the problem.

00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:41.142
I had been an orphanage tourist,

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.027
a voluntourist.

00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:48.034
I then set up my own orphanage
and facilitated orphanage tourism

00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:50.707
in order to generate funds
for my orphanage,

00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:53.065
before I knew better.

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.383
What I came to learn

00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:59.817
is that no matter how good
my orphanage was,

00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:04.496
it was never going to give those kids
what they really needed:

00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:07.449
their families.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:12.317
I know that it can feel
incredibly depressing

00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:16.096
to learn that helping vulnerable children
and overcoming poverty

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.659
is not as simple as we've all
been led to believe it should be.

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:23.943
But thankfully, there is a solution.

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:28.462
These problems are reversible
and preventable,

00:09:28.486 --> 00:09:30.500
and when we know better,

00:09:30.524 --> 00:09:31.919
we can do better.

00:09:33.093 --> 00:09:35.441
The organization that I run today,

00:09:35.465 --> 00:09:37.737
the Cambodian Children's Trust,

00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.789
is no longer an orphanage.

00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:46.158
In 2012, we changed the model
in favor of family-based care.

00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:50.862
I now lead an amazing team
of Cambodian social workers,

00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:52.446
nurses and teachers.

00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:55.388
Together, we work within communities

00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:58.726
to untangle a complex web of social issues

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.755
and help Cambodian
families escape poverty.

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:06.933
Our primary focus is on preventing
some of the most vulnerable families

00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:08.118
in our community

00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:10.529
from being separated in the first place.

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:13.527
But in cases where it's not possible

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.805
for a child to live
with its biological family,

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:18.971
we support them in foster care.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.837
Family-based care is always better

00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:26.955
than placing a child in an institution.

00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:31.250
Do you remember that first photo
that I showed you before?

00:10:32.055 --> 00:10:35.198
See that girl who is just about
to catch the ball?

00:10:35.222 --> 00:10:36.759
Her name is Torn

00:10:37.463 --> 00:10:40.766
She's a strong, brave
and fiercely intelligent girl.

00:10:41.337 --> 00:10:44.232
But in 2006, when I first met her

00:10:44.256 --> 00:10:47.287
living in that corrupt
and abusive orphanage,

00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.749
she had never been to school.

00:10:50.373 --> 00:10:52.440
She was suffering terrible neglect,

00:10:53.137 --> 00:10:55.973
and she yearned desperately

00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:58.713
for the warmth and love of her mother.

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:04.618
But this is a photo of Torn today
with her family.

00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:07.056
Her mother now has a secure job,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.604
her siblings are doing well in high school

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:13.536
and she is just about to finish
her nursing degree at university.

00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:15.679
For Torn's family --

00:11:15.703 --> 00:11:22.701
(Applause)

00:11:24.237 --> 00:11:25.642
for Torn's family,

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:28.256
the cycle of poverty has been broken.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:32.943
The family-based care model
that we have developed at CCT

00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:34.776
has been so successful,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.178
that it's now being put forward
by UNICEF Cambodia

00:11:38.202 --> 00:11:39.718
and the Cambodian government

00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:43.815
as a national solution
to keep children in families.

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:46.473
And one of the best --

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.886
(Applause)

00:11:52.664 --> 00:11:57.006
And one of the best ways
that you can help to solve this problem

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.826
is by giving these eight million
children a voice

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.742
and become an advocate
for family-based care.

00:12:04.538 --> 00:12:07.640
If we work together to raise awareness,

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:10.500
we can make sure the world knows

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:15.632
that we need to put an end
to the unnecessary institutionalization

00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:17.316
of vulnerable children.

00:12:18.153 --> 00:12:19.721
How do we achieve that?

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:24.021
By redirecting our support
and our donations

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:28.371
away from orphanages
and residential care institutions

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:34.473
towards organizations that are committed
to keeping children in families.

00:12:35.564 --> 00:12:38.983
I believe we can make this happen
in our lifetime,

00:12:39.007 --> 00:12:42.650
and as a result, we will see
developing communities thrive

00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:45.867
and ensure that vulnerable
children everywhere

00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:49.867
have what all children need and deserve:

00:12:50.648 --> 00:12:52.035
a family.

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:53.239
Thank you.

00:12:53.263 --> 00:12:57.222
(Applause)
