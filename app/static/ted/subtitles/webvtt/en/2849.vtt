WEBVTT

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.509
Before I get to bulk
of what I have to say,

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.093
I feel compelled just to mention
a couple of things about myself.

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:12.793
I am not some mystical,

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:14.655
spiritual sort of person.

00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.696
I'm a science writer.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.991
I studied physics in college.

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:22.977
I used to be a science
correspondent for NPR.

00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:25.607
OK, that said:

00:00:26.552 --> 00:00:29.791
in the course of working
on a story for NPR,

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.093
I got some advice from an astronomer

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:34.224
that challenged my outlook,

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.246
and frankly, changed my life.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:39.384
You see, the story was about an eclipse,

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:43.952
a partial solar eclipse
that was set to cross the country

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.808
in May of 1994.

00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.815
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.116
and he explained what was going to happen
and how to view it,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.361
but he emphasized that, as interesting
as a partial solar eclipse is,

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:01.895
a much rarer total solar eclipse
is completely different.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.773
In a total eclipse,
for all of two or three minutes,

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:09.128
the moon completely blocks
the face of the sun,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:14.392
creating what he described
as the most awe-inspiring spectacle

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:15.812
in all of nature.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.969
And so the advice he gave me was this:

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:23.084
"Before you die," he said,

00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:27.385
"you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse."

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.586
Well honestly,
I felt a little uncomfortable

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.018
hearing that from someone
I didn't know very well;

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.433
it felt sort of intimate.

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:38.188
But it got my attention,
and so I did some research.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.052
Now the thing about total eclipses is,

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:43.462
if you wait for one to come to you,

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.878
you're going to be waiting a long time.

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:51.422
Any given point on earth
experiences a total eclipse

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:54.502
about once every 400 years.

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:58.926
But if you're willing to travel,
you don't have to wait that long.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.267
And so I learned
that a few years later, in 1998,

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.078
a total eclipse was going
to cross the Caribbean.

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.730
Now, a total eclipse is visible
only along a narrow path,

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:12.434
about a hundred miles wide,

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.552
and that's where the moon's shadow falls.

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:16.707
It's called the "path of totality."

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.154
And in February 1998,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.625
the path of totality
was going to cross Aruba.

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.965
So I talked to my husband,
and we thought: February? Aruba?

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.708
Sounded like a good idea anyway.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:29.804
(Laughter)

00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:32.463
So we headed south,

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:34.959
to enjoy the sun
and to see what would happen

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.798
when the sun briefly went away.

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:40.527
Well, the day of the eclipse
found us and many other people

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.732
out behind the Hyatt Regency,

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:43.919
on the beach,

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.654
waiting for the show to begin.

00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:48.849
And we wore eclipse glasses
with cardboard frames

00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:52.992
and really dark lenses that enabled us
to look at the sun safely.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:58.202
A total eclipse begins
as a partial eclipse,

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:02.002
as the moon very slowly makes its way
in front of the sun.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:06.254
So first it looked the sun
had a little notch in its edge,

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:09.399
and then that notch grew
larger and larger,

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.271
turning the sun into a crescent.

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:15.579
And it was all very interesting,
but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:17.527
I mean, the day remained bright.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:20.561
If I hadn't known
what was going on overhead,

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:22.998
I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:28.862
Well, about 10 minutes before
the total solar eclipse was set to begin,

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:30.677
weird things started to happen.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:33.790
A cool wind kicked up.

00:03:34.808 --> 00:03:38.721
Daylight looked odd,
and shadows became very strange;

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:40.979
they looked bizarrely sharp,

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:44.794
as if someone had turned up
the contrast knob on the TV.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.634
Then I looked offshore,
and I noticed running lights on boats,

00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:52.221
so clearly it was getting dark,

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:53.831
although I hadn't realized it.

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:56.128
Well soon, it was obvious
it was getting dark.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.296
It felt like my eyesight was failing.

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.960
And then all of a sudden,

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:02.348
the lights went out.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.468
Well, at that,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:08.109
a cheer erupted from the beach,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.026
and I took off my eclipse glasses,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.641
because at this point
during the total eclipse,

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:15.760
it was safe to look at the sun
with the naked eye.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.181
And I glanced upward,

00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:22.816
and I was just dumbstruck.

00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.278
Now, consider that, at this point,
I was in my mid-30s.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:36.915
I had lived on earth long enough
to know what the sky looks like.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.820
I mean --

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:39.926
(Laughter)

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.044
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies

00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:47.009
and starry skies and angry skies

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.141
and pink skies at sunrise.

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:52.946
But here was a sky I had never seen.

00:04:54.317 --> 00:04:56.593
First, there were the colors.

00:04:56.617 --> 00:04:59.582
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.019
like twilight.

00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:02.753
But on the horizon it was orange,

00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:04.078
like sunset,

00:05:04.102 --> 00:05:05.696
360 degrees.

00:05:06.426 --> 00:05:09.068
And up above, in the twilight,

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:11.517
bright stars and planets had come out.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.143
So there was Jupiter

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.903
and there was Mercury

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.200
and there was Venus.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.105
They were all in a line.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.482
And there, along this line,

00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:26.754
was this thing,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:30.302
this glorious, bewildering thing.

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:35.077
It looked like a wreath
woven from silvery thread,

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.295
and it just hung out there
in space, shimmering.

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:44.142
That was the sun's outer atmosphere,

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.975
the solar corona.

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.358
And pictures just don't do it justice.

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:52.915
It's not just a ring or halo
around the sun;

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.549
it's finely textured,
like it's made out of strands of silk.

00:05:57.763 --> 00:06:00.264
And although it looked
nothing like our sun,

00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:02.542
of course, I knew that's what it was.

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:06.398
So there was the sun,
and there were the planets,

00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:10.453
and I could see how the planets
revolve around the sun.

00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:13.262
It's like I had left our solar system

00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:15.882
and was standing on some alien world,

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:17.671
looking back at creation.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.170
And for the first time in my life,

00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:25.216
I just felt viscerally connected
to the universe

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.861
in all of its immensity.

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:29.615
Time stopped,

00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:32.935
or it just kind of felt nonexistent,

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:36.043
and what I beheld with my eyes --

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.552
I didn't just see it,

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.182
it felt like a vision.

00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:44.716
And I stood there in this nirvana

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.166
for all of 174 seconds --
less than three minutes --

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.573
when all of a sudden, it was over.

00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:54.948
The sun burst out,

00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:56.634
the blue sky returned,

00:06:56.658 --> 00:06:59.835
the stars and the planets
and the corona were gone.

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:01.676
The world returned to normal.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:04.296
But I had changed.

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:08.875
And that's how I became an umbraphile --

00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:10.747
an eclipse chaser.

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.780
(Laughter)

00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:16.474
So, this is how I spend my time
and hard-earned money.

00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:22.627
Every couple of years, I head off
to wherever the moon's shadow will fall

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:25.041
to experience another couple minutes

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:26.525
of cosmic bliss,

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:28.836
and to share the experience with others:

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.867
with friends in Australia,

00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:33.444
with an entire city in Germany.

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:37.806
In 1999, in Munich,
I joined hundreds of thousands

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.591
who filled the streets and the rooftops
and cheered in unison

00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:44.542
as the solar corona emerged.

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:47.935
And over time, I've become something else:

00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:50.586
an eclipse evangelist.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:52.956
I see it as my job

00:07:53.737 --> 00:07:58.565
to pay forward the advice
that I received all those years ago.

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:01.398
And so let me tell you:

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.763
before you die,

00:08:04.787 --> 00:08:09.765
you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.670
It is the ultimate experience of awe.

00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.364
Now, that word, "awesome,"
has grown so overused

00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:21.552
that it's lost its original meaning.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:26.055
True awe, a sense of wonder
and insignificance

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:28.610
in the face of something
enormous and grand,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:29.869
is rare in our lives.

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.721
But when you experience it, it's powerful.

00:08:34.484 --> 00:08:36.839
Awe dissolves the ego.

00:08:36.863 --> 00:08:38.857
It makes us feel connected.

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:41.976
Indeed, it promotes
empathy and generosity.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.595
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome
than a total solar eclipse.

00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:50.882
Unfortunately, few Americans
have seen one,

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:53.126
because it's been 38 years

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.320
since one last touched
the continental United States

00:08:56.344 --> 00:09:00.412
and 99 years since one last crossed
the breadth of the nation.

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:03.723
But that is about to change.

00:09:03.747 --> 00:09:06.179
Over the next 35 years,

00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:11.138
five total solar eclipses will visit
the continental United States,

00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:14.298
and three of them
will be especially grand.

00:09:15.146 --> 00:09:19.820
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --

00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:22.523
(Applause)

00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:26.633
the moon's shadow will race
from Oregon to South Carolina.

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:32.699
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow
heads north from Texas to Maine.

00:09:32.723 --> 00:09:34.895
In 2045, on August 12,

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.657
the path cuts from California to Florida.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:40.704
I say:

00:09:41.673 --> 00:09:44.264
What if we made these holidays?

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:45.494
What if we --

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.546
(Laughter)

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.252
(Applause)

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:55.333
What if we all stood together,

00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:57.433
as many people as possible,

00:09:57.457 --> 00:09:59.229
in the shadow of the moon?

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:05.093
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe
would help heal our divisions,

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:08.013
get us to treat each other
just a bit more humanely.

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:14.744
Now, admittedly, some folks consider
my evangelizing a little out there;

00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:17.345
my obsession, eccentric.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:22.872
I mean, why focus so much attention
on something so brief?

00:10:22.896 --> 00:10:26.598
Why cross the globe --
or state lines, for that matter --

00:10:26.622 --> 00:10:29.639
for something that lasts three minutes?

00:10:31.165 --> 00:10:32.315
As I said:

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:35.114
I am not a spiritual person.

00:10:36.006 --> 00:10:38.577
I don't believe in God.

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:39.909
I wish I did.

00:10:40.892 --> 00:10:43.131
But when I think of my own mortality --

00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:45.578
and I do, a lot --

00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.551
when I think of everyone I have lost,

00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:52.294
my mother in particular,

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.578
what soothes me

00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:58.694
is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.

00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:02.712
I picture myself on that beach,

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.172
looking at that sky,

00:11:05.037 --> 00:11:07.209
and I remember how I felt.

00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:11.273
My existence may be temporary,

00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:14.485
but that's OK because, my gosh,

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:16.598
look at what I'm a part of.

00:11:18.214 --> 00:11:20.343
And so this is a lesson I've learned,

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:22.930
and it's one that applies
to life in general:

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.205
duration of experience
does not equal impact.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:32.731
One weekend, one conversation --
hell, one glance --

00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:34.888
can change everything.

00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:39.994
Cherish those moments
of deep connection with other people,

00:11:40.018 --> 00:11:41.429
with the natural world,

00:11:41.453 --> 00:11:43.192
and make them a priority.

00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:45.630
Yes, I chase eclipses.

00:11:45.654 --> 00:11:47.671
You might chase something else.

00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:51.001
But it's not about the 174 seconds.

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.000
It's about how they change

00:11:55.024 --> 00:11:56.591
the years that come after.

00:11:57.114 --> 00:11:58.284
Thank you.

00:11:58.308 --> 00:12:02.941
(Applause)
