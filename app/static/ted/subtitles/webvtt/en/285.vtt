00:00:01.523 --> 00:00:04.433
This is a work in process,

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:08.992
based on some comments
that were made at TED two years ago

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:12.665
about the need for the storage of vaccine.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.309
(Video): [On this planet

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.848
1.6 billion people

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:18.837
don't have access to electricity

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.996
refrigeration

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.637
or stored fuels

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.435
this is a problem

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.775
it impacts:

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.487
the spread of disease

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.319
the storage of food and medicine

00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:40.445
and the quality of life.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.535
So here's the plan ...
inexpensive refrigeration

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.823
that doesn't use electricity,
propane, gas, kerosene or consumables

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.491
time for some thermodynamics

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:54.237
And the story of the Intermittent
Absorption Refrigerator]

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:56.887
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago,
I had this thermo teacher

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.014
who talked about absorption
and refrigeration, one of those things

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:02.566
that stuck in my head, a lot
like the Stirling engine:

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.041
it was cool, but you didn't know
what to do with it.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.615
It was invented in 1858,
by this guy Ferdinand CarrÃ©,

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:09.904
but he couldn't actually build
anything with it

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:11.549
because of the tools at the time.

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:15.813
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley
commercialized this thing

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:17.837
called the IcyBall, in 1928.

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.902
It was a really neat idea,
and I'll get to why it didn't work,

00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:22.100
but here's how it works.

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.700
There's two spheres
and they're separated in distance.

00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:27.080
One has a working fluid,
water and ammonia,

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:28.692
and the other is a condenser.

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:30.681
You heat up one side, the hot side.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:33.724
The ammonia evaporates
and it recondenses in the other side.

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:36.286
You let it cool to room temperature,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.473
and then, as the ammonia reevaporates
and combines with the water

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.100
back on the erstwhile hot side,

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:42.978
it creates a powerful cooling effect.

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:45.834
So it was a great idea
that didn't work at all.

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:47.052
They blew up.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:48.611
(Laughter)

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:51.422
Because you're using ammonia,
you get hugely high pressures

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:52.713
if you heated them wrong;

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.492
it topped 400 psi.

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:56.656
The ammonia was toxic,
it sprayed everywhere.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.852
But it was kind of an interesting thought.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.308
So the great thing about 2006,

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:04.187
there's a lot of really great
computational work you can do.

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:08.286
So we got the whole thermodynamics
department at Stanford involved --

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.140
a lot of computational fluid dynamics.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:14.099
We proved that most of the ammonia
refrigeration tables are wrong.

00:02:14.123 --> 00:02:16.176
We found some nontoxic refrigerants

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.311
that worked at very low vapor pressures.

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:20.491
We brought in a team from the UK --

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.490
a lot of great refrigeration people,
it turns out, in the UK --

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:25.794
and built a test rig,
and proved that, in fact,

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:29.061
we could make a low-pressure,
nontoxic refrigerator.

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.433
So this is the way it works.

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:31.869
You put it on a cooking fire.

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:34.003
Most people have
cooking fires in the world,

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:35.581
whether it's camel dung or wood.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.293
It heats up for about 30 minutes,
cools for an hour.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.089
You put it into a container
and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.

00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:44.335
It looks like this.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.176
This is the fifth prototype,
it's not quite done.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.184
It weighs about eight pounds,
and this is the way it works.

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:53.790
You put it into a 15-liter vessel,
about three gallons,

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.286
and it'll cool it down
to just above freezing --

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.788
three degrees above freezing --

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.852
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:02.063
It's really cheap.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:05.163
We think we can build these
in high volumes for about 25 dollars,

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:06.918
in low volumes for about 40 dollars.

00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:10.412
And we think we can make refrigeration
something that everybody can have.

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:11.612
Thank you.

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:13.857
(Applause)
