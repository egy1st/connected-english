00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.444
This is a talk about sugar and cancer.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.166
I became interested in sugar
when I was in college.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.042
Not this kind of sugar.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:14.017
It was the sugar that our biology
professors taught us about

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:18.183
in the context of the coating
of your cells.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.843
Maybe you didn't know that your cells
are coated with sugar.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:24.442
And I didn't know that, either,

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.621
until I took these courses in college,

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:28.057
but back then --

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.640
and this was in, let's just
call it the 1980s --

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.814
people didn't know much about why
our cells are coated with sugar.

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:40.805
And when I dug through my notes,
what I noticed I had written down

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.374
is that the sugar coating on our cells
is like the sugar coating

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:46.604
on a peanut M and M.

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:50.864
And people thought
the sugar coating on our cells

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:52.718
was like a protective coating

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:55.993
that somehow made our cells
stronger or tougher.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.060
But we now know, many decades later,

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:01.360
that it's much more complicated than that,

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:06.367
and that the sugars on our cells
are actually very complex.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:12.695
And if you could shrink yourself down
to a little miniature airplane

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.501
and fly right along
the surface of your cells,

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.891
it might look something like this --

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:21.116
with geographical features.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.170
And now, the complex sugars
are these trees and bushes --

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:27.726
weeping willows that are
swaying in the wind

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.787
and moving with the waves.

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.624
And when I started thinking about
all these complex sugars

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:36.574
that are like this foliage on our cells,

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.715
it became one of the most interesting
problems that I encountered

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.743
as a biologist and also as a chemist.

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:46.592
And so now we tend
to think about the sugars

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.884
that are populating
the surface of our cells

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.703
as a language.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:56.223
They have a lot of information
stored in their complex structures.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:59.711
But what are they trying to tell us?

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.863
I can tell you that we do know
some information

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:05.492
that comes from these sugars,

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.451
and it's turned out already
to be incredibly important

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:10.295
in the world of medicine.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:14.438
For example, one thing
your sugars are telling us

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:15.919
is your blood type.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:21.195
So your blood cells, your red blood
cells, are coated with sugars,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.896
and the chemical structures of those
sugars determine your blood type.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.843
So for example, I know
that I am blood type O.

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.978
How many people are also blood type O?

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.160
Put your hands up.

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:35.377
It's a pretty common one,

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.336
so when so few hands go up,
either you're not paying attention

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.250
or you don't know your blood type,
and both of those are bad.

00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:42.289
(Laughter)

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.976
But for those of you who share
the blood type O with me,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.715
what this means is that we have
this chemical structure

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.777
on the surface of our blood cells:

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:54.019
three simple sugars linked together
to make a more complex sugar.

00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:56.311
And that, by definition, is blood type O.

00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.496
Now, how many people are blood type A?

00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:01.743
Right here.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:04.728
That means you have
an enzyme in your cells

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.168
that adds one more building block,

00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:08.567
that red sugar,

00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.415
to build a more complex structure.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:13.506
And how many people are blood type B?

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:15.463
Quite a few.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.215
You have a slightly different enzyme
than the A people,

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.355
so you build a slightly
different structure,

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.492
and those of you that are AB

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:25.708
have the enzyme from your mother,
the other enzyme from your father,

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:29.507
and now you make both of these structures
in roughly equal proportions.

00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.935
And when this was figured out,

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.697
which is now back in the previous century,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.238
this enabled one of the most important
medical procedures in the world,

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:40.640
which, of course,
is the blood transfusion.

00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:42.560
And by knowing what your blood type is,

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.176
we can make sure,
if you ever need a transfusion,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.721
that your donor has the same blood type,

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.066
so that your body
doesn't see foreign sugars,

00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:54.220
which it wouldn't like
and would certainly reject.

00:03:56.113 --> 00:04:00.355
What else are the sugars on the surface
of your cells trying to tell us?

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:05.805
Well, those sugars might be telling us
that you have cancer.

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.960
So a few decades ago,

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:14.377
correlations began to emerge
from the analysis of tumor tissue.

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:18.912
And the typical scenario is a patient
would have a tumor detected,

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:22.764
and the tissue would be removed
in a biopsy procedure

00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:25.558
and then sent down to a pathology lab

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:29.713
where that tissue would be analyzed
to look for chemical changes

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:34.451
that might inform the oncologist
about the best course of treatment.

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.863
And what was discovered
from studies like that

00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:40.751
is that the sugars have changed

00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:45.772
when the cell transforms
from being healthy to being sick.

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:51.806
And those correlations have come up
again and again and again.

00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:56.963
But a big question in the field
has been: Why?

00:04:56.987 --> 00:05:01.231
Why do cancers have different sugars?
What's the importance of that?

00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:04.616
Why does it happen, and what
can we do about it if it does turn out

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.395
to be related to the disease process?

00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.994
So, one of the changes that we study

00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:18.563
is an increase in the density
of a particular sugar

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:20.916
that's called sialic acid.

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:25.541
And I think this is going to be
one of the most important sugars

00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:26.723
of our times,

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:30.822
so I would encourage everybody
to get familiar with this word.

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:34.467
Sialic acid is not
the kind of sugar that we eat.

00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:36.047
Those are different sugars.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:39.566
This is a kind of sugar
that is actually found

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.718
at certain levels on all
of the cells in your body.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.610
It's actually quite common on your cells.

00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:47.704
But for some reason,

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:53.939
cancer cells, at least in a successful,
progressive disease,

00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:57.072
tend to have more sialic acid

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:59.443
than a normal, healthy cell would have.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:00.909
And why?

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.179
What does that mean?

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:04.728
Well, what we've learned

00:06:04.752 --> 00:06:08.227
is that it has to do
with your immune system.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:12.501
So let me tell you a little bit
about the importance of your immune system

00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:13.689
in cancer.

00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:17.231
And this is something that's, I think,
in the news a lot these days.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:20.161
You know, people are starting
to become familiar with the term

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:22.947
"cancer immune therapy."

00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.782
And some of you might even know people

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:28.713
who are benefiting from these very new
ways of treating cancer.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:33.089
What we now know
is that your immune cells,

00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:37.047
which are the white blood cells
coursing through your bloodstream,

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.727
protect you on a daily basis
from things gone bad --

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:43.092
including cancer.

00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:45.942
And so in this picture,

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:48.687
those little green balls
are your immune cells,

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.659
and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.015
And these immune cells go around
and taste all the cells in your body.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.334
That's their job.

00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:01.668
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:04.196
But once in a while,
a cell might taste bad.

00:07:04.744 --> 00:07:06.555
Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:08.962
and when those immune cells
get the bad taste,

00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:11.795
they launch an all-out strike
and kill those cells.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.783
So we know that.

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:18.223
We also know that if you can
potentiate that tasting,

00:07:18.247 --> 00:07:22.075
if you can encourage those immune cells
to actually take a big old bite

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:23.342
out of a cancer cell,

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:26.957
you get a better job protecting
yourself from cancer every day

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:28.713
and maybe even curing a cancer.

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.355
And there are now a couple of drugs
out there in the market

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.450
that are used to treat cancer patients

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:37.215
that act exactly by this process.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:39.355
They activate the immune system

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.126
so that the immune system
can be more vigorous

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.902
in protecting us from cancer.

00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:45.969
In fact, one of those drugs

00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:48.983
may well have spared
President Jimmy Carter's life.

00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:53.996
Do you remember, President Carter
had malignant melanoma

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.878
that had metastasized to his brain,

00:07:56.902 --> 00:08:00.256
and that diagnosis is one
that is usually accompanied by numbers

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.125
like "months to live."

00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:07.488
But he was treated with one
of these new immune-stimulating drugs,

00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:10.871
and now his melanoma
appears to be in remission,

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:12.536
which is remarkable,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.001
considering the situation
only a few years ago.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.845
In fact, it's so remarkable

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:20.669
that provocative statements like this one:

00:08:20.693 --> 00:08:24.408
"Cancer is having a penicillin moment,"
people are saying,

00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:26.253
with these new immune therapy drugs.

00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:29.475
I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing
to say about a disease

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:32.148
which we've been fighting for a long time

00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:34.252
and mostly losing the battle with.

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:36.384
So this is very exciting.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:39.319
Now what does this have to do with sugars?

00:08:39.343 --> 00:08:42.063
Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.

00:08:42.944 --> 00:08:49.280
When an immune cell snuggles
up against a cancer cell to take a taste,

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.953
it's looking for signs of disease,

00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:53.896
and if it finds those signs,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.166
the cell gets activated and it launches
a missile strike and kills the cell.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:05.079
But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
of that sugar, sialic acid,

00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:08.699
well, it starts to taste pretty good.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:14.151
And there's a protein on immune cells
that grabs the sialic acid,

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:17.976
and if that protein
gets held at that synapse

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.424
between the immune cell
and the cancer cell,

00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:23.156
it puts that immune cell to sleep.

00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:27.111
The sialic acids are telling
the immune cell,

00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:30.336
"Hey, this cell's all right.
Nothing to see here, move along.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.854
Look somewhere else."

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:33.963
So in other words,

00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:38.731
as long as our cells are wearing
a thick coat of sialic acid,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.417
they look fabulous, right?

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:43.388
It's amazing.

00:09:44.524 --> 00:09:47.678
And what if you could strip off that coat

00:09:47.702 --> 00:09:50.000
and take that sugar away?

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:53.023
Well, your immune system

00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.248
might be able to see that cancer cell
for what it really is:

00:09:57.272 --> 00:09:59.496
something that needs to be destroyed.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.186
And so this is what we're doing in my lab.

00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:06.026
We're developing new medicines

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.107
that are basically
cell-surface lawnmowers --

00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:13.514
molecules that go down
to the surface of these cancer cells

00:10:13.538 --> 00:10:16.403
and just cut off those sialic acids,

00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:20.732
so that the immune system
can reach its full potential

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:23.413
in eliminating those cancer
cells from our body.

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:27.114
So in closing,

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:29.972
let me just remind you again:

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.263
your cells are coated with sugars.

00:10:32.972 --> 00:10:37.667
The sugars are telling cells
around that cell

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:39.611
whether the cell is good or bad.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.847
And that's important,

00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.927
because our immune system needs
to leave the good cells alone.

00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:47.421
Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:51.463
But once in a while,
cancers get the ability

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:53.043
to express these new sugars.

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.399
And now that we understand

00:10:54.423 --> 00:10:57.583
how those sugars mesmerize
the immune system,

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:01.792
we can come up with new medicines
to wake up those immune cells,

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:05.043
tell them, "Ignore
the sugars, eat the cell

00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:07.650
and have a delicious snack, on cancer."

00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:09.737
Thank you.

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:12.441
(Applause)
