00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:05.830
Mother Earth: Our end was imminent

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:08.169
yet finality relented.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.653
Wind, water and fire gently revived;

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:16.056
you and I reconciled,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.136
rhythms realigned,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.457
the blues gone green.

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.810
Your care in conserving
in exchange for my fruit

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:30.918
and replenishing this picturous
restoring of painted skies,

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:32.773
mountains rolling,

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:34.417
forest covering --

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:36.403
no more warming.

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:40.802
The purity and simplicity
of how we used to be.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.341
You remember me?

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.033
All I give to humanity?

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:48.823
Housing, land, seas, birds,

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:51.775
beast and all of mankind,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.309
exclusively the interface
where you and the elements meet

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.853
and vibrate harmoniously.

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:02.689
(Piano plays)

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.567
(Violin plays)

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.227
(Music)

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:20.694

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.273

00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:23.178
(Music ends)

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:26.640
(Applause)

00:04:26.664 --> 00:04:27.844
My beauty altered,

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.273
muddied waters, fields stripped bare,

00:04:30.297 --> 00:04:33.050
interior scarred beyond repair,

00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:35.507
our memories eroding.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.513
You once obsessed over my frame

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:39.884
and how I came to be;

00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:42.323
my nature, its polarity --

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:48.027
how my sweet winds whisper softly,
yet assault seas.

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:49.521
You remember me?

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:52.243
All I give to humanity?

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:56.104
Housing, land, seas, birds,

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:59.198
beast and all of mankind --

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:04.548
exclusively the interface
where you and the elements meet

00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:06.907
and vibrate harmoniously.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.706
The unseen traveler forever passing,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.217
carrying life,

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:13.440
moving,

00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:16.908
awning of earth felt and heard,

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:19.440
strong and stirring,

00:05:19.464 --> 00:05:20.779
blowing.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.148
Breathe you in, cleansing wind,

00:05:24.172 --> 00:05:26.139
gentle and still,

00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:27.495
quieter.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:30.181
The source eternally here,

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.680
ascent and descending:

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.679
air.

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.564
Rhythmic flow,

00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:39.650
fluid and graceful,

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.838
waves of serenity,

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:43.988
smooth strings of purity,

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:46.915
rains replenishing rapidly,

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.168
rivers of dreams,

00:05:49.192 --> 00:05:51.819
raging springs
covering earth in abundance,

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:54.328
universal solvent dissolving,

00:05:54.352 --> 00:05:59.295
drink, liquid, life and power:

00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:01.714
water.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.084
Born when the universe was formed,

00:06:04.108 --> 00:06:05.378
warmed mankind,

00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:06.594
gave him light,

00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:09.602
colored rays illuminate ember flickers

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:11.713
incandescent, powerful and brilliant.

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:14.094
Sacred son of air, father of fury,

00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:15.545
heat dancing vigorously

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.416
between perfection and beauty.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.997
Unconfined agility,

00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:21.042
fast and fancy,

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:23.628
sparks of ingenuity rise:

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:25.442
fire.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.619
