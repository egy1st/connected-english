WEBVTT

00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:04.674
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.349
AI researchers have always said

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:10.967
that we humans do not need to worry,

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:14.571
because only menial jobs
will be taken over by machines.

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:16.877
Is that really true?

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:22.192
They have also said
that AI will create new jobs,

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:25.627
so those who lose their jobs
will find a new one.

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:27.619
Of course.

00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:29.815
But the real question is:

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.944
How many of those
who may lose their jobs to AI

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.457
will be able to land a new one,

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:42.331
especially when AI is smart enough
to learn better than most of us?

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.582
Let me ask you a question:

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.464
How many of you think

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:54.582
that AI will pass the entrance examination
of a top university by 2020?

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.293
Oh, so many. OK.

00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:02.675
So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!"

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.503
Now singularity is the issue.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.685
And some others may say, "Maybe,

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.217
because AI already won
against a top Go player."

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:18.894
And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh."

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:23.788
That means we do not know
the answer yet, right?

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:29.228
So that was the reason why
I started Todai Robot Project,

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:33.124
making an AI which passes
the entrance examination

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.737
of the University of Tokyo,

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.298
the top university in Japan.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:42.012
This is our Todai Robot.

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:49.941
And, of course, the brain of the robot
is working in the remote server.

00:01:50.747 --> 00:01:54.969
It is now writing a 600-word essay

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:59.112
on maritime trade in the 17th century.

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:00.901
How does that sound?

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:06.217
Why did I take the entrance exam
as its benchmark?

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:11.839
Because I thought we had to study
the performance of AI

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.977
in comparison to humans,

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.861
especially on the skills and expertise

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:20.973
which are believed
to be acquired only by humans

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:23.332
and only through education.

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:27.825
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.270
you have to pass
two different types of exams.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:36.054
The first one is
a national standardized test

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.481
in multiple-choice style.

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:40.960
You have to take seven subjects

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:42.939
and achieve a high score --

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:47.735
I would say like an 85 percent
or more accuracy rate --

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.846
to be allowed to take
the second stage written test

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.029
prepared by Todai.

00:02:54.994 --> 00:03:00.311
So let me first explain
how modern AI works,

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:03.404
taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge
as an example.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.618
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:

00:03:08.642 --> 00:03:13.103
"Mozart's last symphony
shares its name with this planet."

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:18.208
Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!"
question always asks,

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:21.560
always ends with "this" something:

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.411
"this" planet, "this" country,

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:27.043
"this" rock musician, and so on.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:31.366
In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask
many different types of questions,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.227
but a single type,

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.787
which we call "factoid questions."

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.142
By the way, do you know the answer?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.035
If you do not know the answer
and if you want to know the answer,

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.346
what would you do?

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.292
You Google, right? Of course.

00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:52.796
Why not?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.412
But you have to pick appropriate keywords

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:00.800
like "Mozart," "last"
and "symphony" to search.

00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:03.862
The machine basically does the same.

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:09.117
Then this Wikipedia page
will be ranked top.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.748
Then the machine reads the page.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:12.943
No, uh-uh.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.932
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.924
including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:22.609
is able to read.

00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:27.237
But they are very good
at searching and optimizing.

00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:30.181
It will recognize

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:33.801
that the keywords "Mozart,"
"last" and "symphony"

00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.728
are appearing heavily around here.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.165
So if it can find a word which is a planet

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.837
and which is co-occurring
with these keywords,

00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:47.850
that must be the answer.

00:04:48.762 --> 00:04:53.948
This is how Watson finds
the answer "Jupiter," in this case.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:05:00.482
Our Todai Robot works similarly,
but a bit smarter

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:03.745
in answering history yes-no questions,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.223
like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'
Is this sentence true or false?"

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:15.254
Our robot starts producing
a factoid question,

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:20.177
like: "Charlemagne repelled
[this person type]" by itself.

00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:25.727
Then, "Avars" but not
"Magyars" is ranked top.

00:05:26.357 --> 00:05:29.406
This sentence is likely to be false.

00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:35.632
Our robot does not read,
does not understand,

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:40.479
but it is statistically
correct in many cases.

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.655
For the second stage written test,

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:49.785
it is required to write
a 600-word essay like this one:

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:52.087
[Discuss the rise and fall
of the maritime trade

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:54.533
in East and Southeast Asia
in the 17th century ...]

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:55.944
and as I have shown earlier,

00:05:55.968 --> 00:06:00.162
our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia,

00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.147
combined them together,

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:05.790
and optimized it to produce an essay

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:08.021
without understanding a thing.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:09.782
(Laughter)

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:14.701
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:16.286
than most of the students.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.701
(Laughter)

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.254
How about mathematics?

00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:24.512
A fully automatic math-solving machine

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.167
has been a dream

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:30.870
since the birth of the word
"artificial intelligence,"

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:37.792
but it has stayed at the level
of arithmetic for a long, long time.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.880
Last year, we finally succeeded
in developing a system

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:50.077
which solved pre-university-level
problems from end to end,

00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:51.363
like this one.

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:57.650
This is the original problem
written in Japanese,

00:06:57.674 --> 00:07:02.071
and we had to teach it
2,000 mathematical axioms

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.869
and 8,000 Japanese words

00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:09.451
to make it accept the problems
written in natural language.

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:13.776
And it is now translating
the original problems

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.939
into machine-readable formulas.

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:24.677
Weird, but it is now ready
to solve it, I think.

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.112
Go and solve it.

00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:31.102
Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.610
Even more weird,

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:38.459
but probably this is the most
fun part for the machine.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.834
(Laughter)

00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:43.673
Now it outputs a perfect answer,

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:48.404
though its proof is impossible to read,
even for mathematicians.

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:57.734
Anyway, last year our robot
was among the top one percent

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.832
in the second stage written
exam in mathematics.

00:08:02.652 --> 00:08:05.862
(Applause)

00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:07.723
Thank you.

00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:10.218
So, did it enter Todai?

00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:14.039
No, not as I expected.

00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:16.182
Why?

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:18.845
Because it doesn't understand any meaning.

00:08:20.308 --> 00:08:24.387
Let me show you a typical error
it made in the English test.

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.388
[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.
Just a few more minutes.

00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:30.451
Sunil: Wait. ______ .
Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:31.626
Two people are talking.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.704
For us, who can understand
the situation --

00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:36.477
[1. "We walked for a long time."
2. "We're almost there."

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.533
3. "Your shoes look expensive."
4. "Your shoelace is untied."]

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:42.430
it is obvious number four
is the correct answer, right?

00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:44.692
But Todai Robot chose number two,

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:50.076
even after learning 15 billion
English sentences

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.828
using deep learning technologies.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.772
OK, so now you might
understand what I said:

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.047
modern AIs do not read,

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:04.484
do not understand.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:08.685
They only disguise as if they do.

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:15.848
This is the distribution graph

00:09:15.872 --> 00:09:21.649
of half a million students
who took the same exam as Todai Robot.

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:27.723
Now our Todai Robot
is among the top 20 percent,

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.401
and it was capable to pass

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:35.366
more than 60 percent
of the universities in Japan --

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.767
but not Todai.

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:42.141
But see how it is beyond the volume zone

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:45.029
of to-be white-collar workers.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.918
You might think I was delighted.

00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:55.910
After all, my robot was surpassing
students everywhere.

00:09:57.022 --> 00:09:59.713
Instead, I was alarmed.

00:10:01.086 --> 00:10:06.693
How on earth could this unintelligent
machine outperform students --

00:10:06.717 --> 00:10:08.009
our children?

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.186
Right?

00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:14.503
I decided to investigate
what was going on in the human world.

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:21.271
I took hundreds of sentences
from high school textbooks

00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:25.172
and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,

00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:29.339
and asked thousands
of high school students to answer.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.866
Here is an example:

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.708
[Buddhism spread to ... ,
Christianity to ... and Oceania,

00:10:34.732 --> 00:10:35.883
and Islam to ...]

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:38.647
Of course, the original problems
are written in Japanese,

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.826
their mother tongue.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.365
[ ______ has spread to Oceania.

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:43.806
1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.129
Obviously, Christianity
is the answer, isn't it?

00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:47.367
It's written!

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:53.508
And Todai Robot chose
the correct answer, too.

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:59.637
But one-third of junior
high school students

00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.273
failed to answer this question.

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:07.615
Do you think it is only the case in Japan?

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:09.615
I do not think so,

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:16.010
because Japan is always ranked
among the top in OECD PISA tests,

00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:19.961
measuring 15-year-old
students' performance in mathematics,

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:21.949
science and reading

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.609
every three years.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.443
We have been believing

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:31.510
that everybody can learn

00:11:31.534 --> 00:11:33.439
and learn well,

00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:37.160
as long as we provide
good learning materials

00:11:37.184 --> 00:11:38.639
free on the web

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:41.732
so that they can access
through the internet.

00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:47.615
But such wonderful materials
may benefit only those who can read well,

00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:52.469
and the percentage
of those who can read well

00:11:52.493 --> 00:11:55.871
may be much less than we expected.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.281
How we humans will coexist with AI

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.827
is something we have
to think about carefully,

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:07.988
based on solid evidence.

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:13.040
At the same time,
we have to think in a hurry

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.466
because time is running out.

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:17.268
Thank you.

00:12:17.626 --> 00:12:21.559
(Applause)

00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.291
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.

00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:26.080
Noriko Arai: Thank you.

00:12:26.104 --> 00:12:31.408
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully
give us a sense of how AIs think,

00:12:31.432 --> 00:12:32.996
what they can do amazingly

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.715
and what they can't do.

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.233
But -- do I read you right,

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:41.527
that you think we really need
quite an urgent revolution in education

00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:45.706
to help kids do the things
that humans can do better than AIs?

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.058
NA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:47.082 --> 00:12:51.117
Because we humans
can understand the meaning.

00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:56.047
That is something
which is very, very lacking in AI.

00:12:56.071 --> 00:13:00.439
But most of the students
just pack the knowledge

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:04.366
without understanding
the meaning of the knowledge,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.199
so that is not knowledge,
that is just memorizing,

00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:09.673
and AI can do the same thing.

00:13:09.697 --> 00:13:13.328
So we have to think about
a new type of education.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:16.641
CA: A shift from knowledge,
rote knowledge, to meaning.

00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:17.816
NA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.080
CA: Well, there's a challenge
for the educators. Thank you so much.

00:13:21.104 --> 00:13:22.802
NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:13:22.826 --> 00:13:24.011
(Applause)
