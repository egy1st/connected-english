WEBVTT

00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:04.360
It's Christmas Eve, 1968.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.936
The Apollo 8 spacecraft
has successfully completed

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.680
its first three orbits around the moon.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.656
Launched from Cape Canaveral
three days before,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.376
this is the first time

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.120
that humans have ever traveled
beyond low Earth orbit.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.456
On the vessel's fourth pass,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.176
the Earth slowly comes into view

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.160
and reveals itself
above the Moon's horizon.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.616
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically
asks his crewmates where their camera is,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.056
grabs the Hasselblad,
points it towards the window,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.416
presses the shutter,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.560
and takes one of the most
important photographs of all time:

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.760
"Earthrise."

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.376
When the crew was safely home
a few days later,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.020
they were asked about the mission.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.216
Anders famously replied,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.336
"We went to the moon,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560
but we actually discovered Earth."

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.040
What did he and his fellow crewmates feel

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.240
in this incredible moment?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.376
In a study released just this past year,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.456
a team of researchers
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.096
examined the testimonies
of hundreds of astronauts

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.376
who had the opportunity
to view the Earth from space.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Their analysis uncovered
three common feelings:

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.976
first, a greater appreciation
for Earth's beauty;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.096
second, an increased sense
of connection to all other living beings;

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.480
and third, an unexpected,
often overwhelming sense of emotion.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.616
The researchers believe that seeing
the Earth from a great distance

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.576
provokes someone to develop
new cognitive frameworks

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.280
to understand what they are seeing.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.216
They believe these astronauts
were forever changed

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.096
by this new view,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.016
this new perspective,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280
this new visual truth.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.720
This feeling is commonly referred to
as the "overview effect."

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.360
Only 558 people
have ever been to outer space.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.336
558 people had the opportunity

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.496
to gaze down in awe,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.176
to wonder at our planet

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.816
floating in an infinite sea of darkness.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.616
But what if that number were bigger?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.136
Three years ago,
I set off on my own mission:

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.896
to see if I could bring this feeling
of overwhelming scale and beauty

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.576
to many more people

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.656
just by using one small computer

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880
in my small New York City apartment.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.496
It was then, in 2013,
that I launched "Daily Overview."

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.056
Every day, I have used satellite imagery

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.456
to create one expansive
overhead view of our planet.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.416
More than 1,000 of these images
have been created thus far,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.936
and more than 600,000 people

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.016
tune in for this daily dose
of perspectives.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.136
I create the imagery by curating photos
from the massive archive

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.520
of a satellite company
called Digital Globe.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.856
They operate a constellation
of five satellites,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.496
each roughly the size of an ambulance,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.936
that is constantly
taking pictures of the Earth

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.280
as they orbit at
28,000 kilometers per hour.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
Now, what does this mean?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.976
Each of these satellites
is equipped with a camera

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.896
that has a focal length of 16 meters,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.616
so that's roughly 290 times greater

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.960
than a DSLR camera equipped
with a standard 55 millimeter lens.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.256
So if were able to attach
one of their satellites

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.440
to the roof of this theater in Oxford,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.976
we could take a picture of a football,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.080
clearly, on the pitch
at the stadium in Amsterdam.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.600
That's 450 kilometers away.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.496
That's incredibly powerful technology.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.016
And I decided at the beginning
of this project

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.496
that I would use
that incredible technology

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.416
to focus on the places

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.760
where humans have impacted the planet.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.496
As a species, we dig and scrape
the Earth for resources,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.960
we produce energy,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.200
we raise animals
and cultivate crops for food,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.336
we build cities, we move around,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.696
we create waste.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.016
And in the process
of doing all of these things,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.136
we shape landscapes and seascapes

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.120
and cityscapes with increasing
control and impunity.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.896
So with that in mind,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.600
I would like to share
a few of my overviews with you now.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.176
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.960
waiting outside the entry
to the port of Singapore.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.816
This facility is the second-busiest
in the world by terms of total tonnage,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.216
accounting for one-fifth
of the world's shipping containers

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.696
and one half of the annual supply

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.080
of crude oil.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.696
If you look closely at this overview,
you'll see a lot of little specks.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.576
Those are actually cows at a feedlot

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.120
in Summerfield, Texas,
in the United States.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.296
So once cows reach a particular weight,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.456
roughly 300 kilograms,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.280
they are moved here
and placed on a specialized diet.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.096
Over the next three to four months,
the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.256
before they are shipped off to slaughter.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.696
You're also probably wondering
about this glowing pool at the top there.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.576
That gets its color from a unique
combination of manure, chemicals

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.640
and a particular type of algae
that grows in the stagnant water.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.976
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.296
in the Pilbara region
of Western Australia,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.136
a beautiful yet scary scar
on the face of the Earth.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.216
Of the world's mined iron ore,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.176
98 percent is used to make steel

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.496
and is therefore a major component
in the construction of buildings,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.520
automobiles or appliances
such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.120
This is a solar concentrator
in Seville, Spain.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.576
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.656
which are arrayed in concentric circles
around an 140-meter-tall tower

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.920
at its center.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.936
At the top of the tower,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.176
there is a capsule of molten salt

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.816
that gets heated by the beams
of light reflected upwards

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.160
from the mirrors below.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.256
From there, the salt circulates
to a storage tank underground,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.736
where it produces steam,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.216
which spins turbines

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.736
and generates enough electricity
to power 70,000 homes

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.080
and offsets 30,000 tons
of carbon dioxide emissions every year.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.216
This overview shows deforestation
in Santa Cruz, Bolivia

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.120
immediately adjacent
to untouched tracts of rainforest.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.736
Deforestation in the country
has primarily been driven

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.376
by the expansion of mechanized agriculture

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.056
and cattle ranching,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.296
so as the country tries to meet
the demand of its growing population

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.536
and feed them,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.856
the sacrificial destruction
of its rainforest

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.360
has taken place to do so.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.136
It is estimated that the country
lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.616
in one decade alone

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.840
from 2000 until 2010.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.840
This is the Eixample district
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.416
So the overview perspective
can be incredibly helpful

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.456
to help us understand how cities function

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.416
and how we can devise
smarter solutions for urban planning,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.576
and this will become only more relevant

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.096
as it is expected that 4.9 billion people
will live in cities around the world

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.360
by the year 2030.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.456
This area of Barcelona is characterized
by its strict grid pattern,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.496
apartments with communal courtyards

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.696
and these octagonal intersections

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.736
which allow for more sunlight,
better ventilation

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.640
and additional parking at street level.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.920
And here we see that grid pattern
but under much different circumstances.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.976
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp
in northern Kenya,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.936
the largest such facility
of its kind in the world.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.216
To cope with the influx of refugees
who are fleeing Somalia,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.136
where there is famine and conflict,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.656
the UN has built this area
gridded out at left

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.416
called the LFO extension

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.976
to house more and more refugees

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.976
who are arriving and occupying
these white dots,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.336
which are actually tents

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.840
which will slowly fill up
the area over time.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.576
So if you have one of these overviews,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.400
you have a moment in time.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.136
If we have two overviews, however,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.000
we are able to tell stories
about changes in time.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.096
I call that feature
of the project "Juxtapose,"

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.480
and we'll share a few examples
of it with you now.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.560
So the tulip fields in Netherlands
bloom every year in April.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.256
So we take an image
captured in March a few weeks before

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.800
and contrast it to one
taken a few weeks later.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.000
We're able to watch the flowers bloom
in this magnificent cascade of color.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.440
It is estimated that the Dutch produce
4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.256
In 2015, two dams collapsed

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.976
at an iron ore mine
in southeastern Brazil,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.616
causing one of the worst
environmental disasters

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.069
in the history of the country.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.376
It is estimated that 62 million
cubic meters of waste

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.096
were released when the dams broke,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.536
destroying numerous villages
in the process,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.560
including Bento Rodrigues,
seen here before ...

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.960
and after the flood.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.816
Ultimately, 19 people
were killed in this disaster.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.936
Half a million people did not
have access to clean drinking water

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.976
for an extended period of time,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.456
and the waste soon entered
into the Doce River,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.976
extended for 650 kilometers

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.656
all the way into the sea,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.480
killing unknowable amounts
of plant and animal life along the way.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.216
And lastly, here is a story
related to the crisis in Syria,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.096
a conflict which has claimed the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.440
and displaced millions.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.536
So this patch of desert
is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.256
the year the conflict started,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.920
and when we compare it to an image
captured just this year in 2017,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.320
we see the construction
of the Zaatari refugee camp.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.696
So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.656
watched the Earth rising above
the lunar landscape for the first time,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.856
there is no way
that you could have imagined

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.040
what the places I just showed you
look like from outer space.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.416
And while you may enjoy
the aesthetics of an image,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.696
once you learn exactly
what it is you're seeing,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.600
you may struggle with the fact
that you still like it.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.296
And that's the tension
I want to create with my work,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.456
because I believe
it is that contemplation,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.416
that internal dialogue

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.856
that will lead to greater
interest in our planet

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.120
and more awareness
of what we're doing to it.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.896
I believe that viewing the Earth
from the overview perspective

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.760
is more important now than ever before.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.776
Through the incredible technology
of these high-flying cameras,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.976
we can see, monitor and expose

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.400
the unprecedented impact
that we are having.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.376
And whether we are scientists

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.416
or engineers or policymakers

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.640
or investors or artists,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.856
if we can adopt
a more expansive perspective,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.176
embrace the truth of what is going on

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.440
and contemplate the long-term
health of our planet,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.336
we will create a better

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.136
and safer and smarter future

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.296
for our one and only home.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.536
Thank you.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.880
(Applause)
