00:00:00.811 --> 00:00:05.131
Why do people deliberately
destroy cultural heritage?

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.701
By doing so,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.319
do they believe
they're erasing our history?

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.167
Our cultural memory?

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.247
It's true that we are losing
cultural heritage to erosion

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.080
and natural disasters,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.038
but this is something
that is simply difficult to avoid.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:28.982
I'm here to show you today
how we can use pictures --

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:30.864
your pictures --

00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:34.008
to reclaim the history that is being lost

00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:36.255
using innovative technology

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:38.382
and the effort of volunteers.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.203
In the early 20th century,

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:46.215
archaeologists discovered
hundreds of statues and artifacts

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.973
at the ancient city of Hatra,

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.147
in northern Iraq.

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:53.757
Statues like this one
were found in fragments,

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.918
some of them missing their heads or arms,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.455
yet the clothing that they are wearing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.925
and their pose

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.232
can still tell us their story.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.389
For example,

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:09.147
we believe that by wearing
a knee-length tunic

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.671
and open bare feet,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.276
this was representative of a priest.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:17.783
However, with a closer look
at this particular piece,

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:22.229
we can see that this tunic being worn
was elaborately decorated,

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:25.075
which has led many researchers to believe

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.972
this was actually a statue of a king
performing his religious functions.

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:37.197
When the Mosul Cultural Museum
opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.468
this statue, as well as others,

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:42.656
were placed there to preserve them
for future generations.

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:48.204
Following the US-led invasion
of Iraq in 2003,

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:52.093
a few statues and artifacts
were relocated to Baghdad,

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:54.192
but this statue remained.

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:59.206
Then in February of last year,
a video was released,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.631
and it instantly went viral.

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.346
Maybe some of you remember seeing it.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.903
Here's a short clip.

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:12.827
(Video) (Singing in Arabic)

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:32.789
(Singing ends)

00:02:34.107 --> 00:02:36.499
Not a very pleasant sight, right?

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.319
Did you notice anything
familiar in the video?

00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:43.055
There it is.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.751
There is that very statue,

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:47.518
as it was toppled over,

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.062
breaking into pieces.

00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:52.837
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.129
we were shocked.

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.487
Since we are archaeologists
using innovative technology

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.301
for digital preservation,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:01.884
an idea sprung to mind.

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:07.315
Maybe we can crowdsource the images
that were taken of these artifacts

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.154
before they were destroyed,

00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:11.121
to create digital reconstructions.

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:12.915
If we can do that,

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.030
maybe we can put them
into a virtual museum

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:16.288
to tell that story.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.534
And so two weeks after we saw this video,

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.697
we started the project
called Project Mosul.

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.101
Remember the pictures of the statue
I showed you before?

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:35.848
This is actually the crowdsourced
reconstruction of it

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:37.477
before it was destroyed.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:40.899
Now, many of you may be wondering,

00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:42.661
how exactly does this work?

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.341
Well, the key to this technology
is called photogrammetry,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:48.821
and it was invented here, in Germany.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.296
It is the technology that allows us
to use two-dimensional images

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.269
taken of the same object
from different angles

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:57.688
to create a 3D model.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.468
I know you may be thinking
this sounds like magic -- but it's not.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:05.023
Let me show you how it works.

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:07.818
Here are two crowdsourced images
of the same statue.

00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:10.323
What the computer can do

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:14.562
is it can detect similar features
between the photographs --

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.619
similar features of the object.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.545
Then, by using multiple photos,

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.297
in this case, it can begin
to reconstruct the object in 3D.

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:25.965
In this case,

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:29.421
you have the position of the cameras
when each image was taken,

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:30.623
shown in blue.

00:04:32.282 --> 00:04:35.696
Now, this is a partial
reconstruction, I admit,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.312
but why would I say partial?

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:42.296
Well, simply because the statue
was positioned against a wall.

00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.474
We don't have photographs
taken of it from the back.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:51.291
If I wanted to complete a full
digital reconstruction of this statue,

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.024
I would need a proper camera,

00:04:53.048 --> 00:04:54.793
tripods, proper lighting,

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:57.307
but we simply can't do that
with crowdsourced images.

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:59.299
Think about it:

00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:01.556
How many of you, when you visit a museum,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.821
take photographs
of all parts of the statue,

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.310
even the back side of it?

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.003
Well, maybe if some of you find
Michelangelo's David interesting,

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:11.178
I guess --

00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:12.686
(Laughter)

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:14.657
But the thing is,

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.821
if we can find more images of this object,

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:19.469
we can improve the 3D model.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.307
When we started the project,

00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:25.480
we started it with
the Mosul Museum in mind.

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:27.171
We figured we may get a few images,

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:28.441
some people interested,

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:30.944
make one or two virtual reconstructions,

00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:35.727
but we had no idea that we had sparked
something that would grow so quickly.

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:37.829
Before we knew it,

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:39.884
we realized it was obvious:

00:05:39.908 --> 00:05:43.812
we could apply this same idea
to lost heritage anywhere.

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.574
And so, we decided to change
the name of the project to Rekrei.

00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:52.527
Then, in the summer of last year,

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:55.591
"The Economist" magazine's media lab
reached out to us.

00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:57.847
They asked us,

00:05:57.871 --> 00:06:00.638
"Hey, would you like us
to build a virtual museum

00:06:00.662 --> 00:06:02.527
to put the reconstructions back inside,

00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:03.831
to tell the story?"

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:05.968
Can you imagine us saying no?

00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:07.293
Of course not.

00:06:07.317 --> 00:06:08.468
We said yes!

00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:09.649
We were so excited.

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:12.853
This was exactly
the initial dream of that project.

00:06:13.662 --> 00:06:14.849
And so now,

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:18.487
any of you can experience
RecoVR Mosul on your phone,

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.804
using Google Cardboard

00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:22.475
or a tablet or even YouTube 360.

00:06:23.044 --> 00:06:26.500
Here is a screenshot
from the virtual museum.

00:06:26.524 --> 00:06:27.674
And there it is ...

00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.809
the partial reconstruction of the statue,

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.700
as well as the Lion of Mosul,

00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:36.396
the first reconstruction
completed by our project.

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.329
Although the video doesn't explicitly show
the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:46.486
we have many other examples
of large artifacts being destroyed

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.651
that were simply too large
to have been stolen.

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:51.535
For example,

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.345
the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.

00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:57.516
This is a digital
reconstruction from before,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.905
and this is actually
during the destruction.

00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:05.026
Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria:

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.200
before ...

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:08.051
and after.

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:12.816
Although virtual reconstructions
are primarily the main focus

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.022
of our project,

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:16.109
some people have been asking the question:

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:19.930
Can we print them in 3D?

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:24.812
We believe 3D printing
doesn't offer a straightforward solution

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:26.026
to lost heritage.

00:07:26.338 --> 00:07:28.287
Once an object is destroyed,

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.461
it's gone.

00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:35.079
But 3D printing does offer
an addition to tell that story.

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:38.094
For example, I can show you here ...

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.574
There is the statue from Hatra

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:46.418
and the Lion of Mosul.

00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:53.442
(Applause)

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.020
Thank you.

00:07:55.044 --> 00:07:56.548
Now, if you look closely,

00:07:56.572 --> 00:08:01.079
you'll notice that there are some parts
that have been printed in color,

00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:03.686
and some parts that are in white or gray.

00:08:04.715 --> 00:08:08.517
This part was added
simply to hold the statues up.

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:11.261
This works the same way
if you visit a museum,

00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:13.566
and a statue is found in fragments;

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.860
it's put together
for the people to see it.

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:17.340
This makes sense, right?

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.274
However, we're much more interested

00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:23.693
in what virtual reality
has to offer for lost heritage.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.921
Here is an example
of one of the tower tombs

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:28.820
that was destroyed in Palmyra.

00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:30.798
Using Sketchfab's online viewer,

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:36.477
we can show that we have reconstructed
three parts of the exterior of the tomb,

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.406
but we also have photos of the inside,

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.099
so we're beginning to create
a reconstruction of the wall

00:08:41.123 --> 00:08:42.273
and the ceiling.

00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:45.688
Archaeologists worked there
for many, many years,

00:08:45.712 --> 00:08:50.449
so we also have architectural
drawing plans of this lost heritage.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:58.721
Unfortunately, we are not only losing
cultural heritage to areas of conflict

00:08:58.745 --> 00:08:59.896
and at war --

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.219
we're also losing it to natural disasters.

00:09:02.878 --> 00:09:06.748
This is a 3D model
of Durbar Square in Kathmandu,

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:09.422
before the earthquake
that occurred last April ...

00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:11.547
and this is after.

00:09:12.563 --> 00:09:14.161
You may be thinking,

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.854
you didn't create these 3D models
with only tourist photographs,

00:09:17.878 --> 00:09:19.269
and that's true.

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.769
But what this represents

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:24.539
is the ability for large, public
organizations and private industry

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:26.973
to come together
for initiatives like ours.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:32.847
And so one of the major challenges
of our project, really,

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:36.759
is to find photographs that were taken
before something happens, right?

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.644
Well, the internet is basically a database
with millions of images, right?

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:45.019
Exactly.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:48.478
So we have begun to develop a tool

00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:52.424
that allows us to extract images
from websites like Flickr,

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:53.946
based on their geotags,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.553
to complete reconstructions.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:10:03.159
Because we're not only losing cultural
heritage to natural disasters and in war,

00:10:03.183 --> 00:10:06.152
but we're also losing it
to something else.

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:10.308
Any idea, just looking
at these two pictures?

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:14.289
Maybe it's a little difficult to remember,

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.733
but only a few weeks ago,

00:10:16.757 --> 00:10:21.367
this was the example of human
destruction by human stupidity.

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:27.258
Because a tourist in Lisbon
wanted to climb onto this statue

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:28.647
and take a selfie with it --

00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:29.672
(Laughter)

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.228
and pulled it down with him.

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:33.585
So we're already finding photographs

00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:35.763
to complete a digital
reconstruction of this.

00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:38.260
We need to remember

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:42.831
that the destruction of cultural heritage
isn't a recent phenomenon.

00:10:43.664 --> 00:10:44.982
In the 16th century,

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:51.484
European priests and explorers burned
thousands of Maya books in the Americas,

00:10:51.508 --> 00:10:54.021
of which we only have a handful left.

00:10:55.444 --> 00:10:57.175
Fast-forward to 2001,

00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:00.506
when the Taliban blew up
the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.

00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:03.489
You see,

00:11:03.513 --> 00:11:07.580
cultural heritage
is about our shared global history.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.561
It helps us connect
with our ancestors and their stories,

00:11:12.585 --> 00:11:16.856
but we're losing pieces of it
every day to natural disasters

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.166
and in areas of conflict.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:24.812
Of course, the loss of human life
is the most heartbreaking loss ...

00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:31.578
but cultural heritage offers us a way
to preserve the memory of the people

00:11:31.602 --> 00:11:33.112
for future generations.

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:38.285
We need your help to reclaim
the history that is being lost.

00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:40.589
Will you join us?

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.888
(Applause)
