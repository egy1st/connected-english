00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.153
Do you remember
these glow-in-the-dark little stars

00:00:03.177 --> 00:00:06.067
which you had on the ceiling
when you were a boy or a girl?

00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:07.301
Yes?

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:08.521
It is light.

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:09.729
It is pure light.

00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:11.655
I think I stared at them way too long

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.452
when I was a five-year-old, you know?

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:14.700
It's so beautiful:

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:17.481
no energy bill, no maintenance.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.709
It is there.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.790
So two years ago, we went back to the lab,

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:23.112
making it more durable,
more light-emitting,

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:24.516
with the experts.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.221
And at the same time,
we got a request from this guy --

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.823
Van Gogh, the famous
Van Gogh Foundation --

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:34.823
who wanted to celebrate
his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:37.097
And they came to me and asked,

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:40.922
"Can you make a place
where he feels more alive again

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.152
in the Netherlands?"

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.730
And I liked that question a lot,

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:44.908
so in way,

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:47.981
we sort of started to connect
these two different worlds.

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:50.324
This is how my brain works,

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:51.498
by the way.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:52.573
(Laughter)

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:54.808
I would love to keep on
doing this for an hour,

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:55.983
but OK --

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.015
(Laughter)

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.817
And this is the result that we made:

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.563
a bicycle path which charges
at daytime via the sun

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:03.709
and glows at night, up to eight hours.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.961
(Applause)

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.311
Thank you.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:10.702
... hinting towards a future
which should be energy friendly

00:01:10.726 --> 00:01:12.422
and linking up the local grounds

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.873
as Van Gogh literally walked
and lived there in 1883.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:19.204
And you can go there every night
for free, no ticket needed.

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:22.434
People experience the beauty
of cycling through the starry night,

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.483
thinking about green energy and safety.

00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:28.222
I want to create places
where people feel connected again.

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.854
And it was somehow great
to make these projects happen

00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:34.724
with the industry,
with the infrastructure companies.

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.037
So when these sheikhs of Qatar
started to call:

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:38.562
"How much for 10 kilometers?"

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:39.601
(Laughter)

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:42.337
Yeah, really, that's a weird call
you're going to get.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:43.521
But it's fascinating

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:46.953
that this is not just a sort
of one-off, nice-to-have special.

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.400
I think this kind of creative thinking,
these kinds of connections --

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:51.608
it's the new economy.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.379
The World Economic Forum,
the think tank in Geneva,

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.802
did an interview
with a lot of smart people

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:57.982
all around the world,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.828
asking, "What are the top 10 skills
you and I need to become successful?"

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:05.172
And what is interesting,
what you see here:

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:07.735
it's not about money

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.660
or being really good in C++,

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:13.701
although these are great skills
to have, I have to admit.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.081
But look at number three, creativity;

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.317
number two, critical thinking;

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:21.441
number one, complex problem-solving --

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:25.986
all the things a robot or a computer
is really bad at.

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:30.315
And this makes me very optimistic,
very hopeful for the new world,

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.215
that as we will live
in this hyper-technological world,

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.681
our human skills --

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.049
our desire for empathy,

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.339
our desire for curiosity,

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:40.078
our desire for beauty --

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:41.836
will be more appreciated again,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.676
and we will live in a world
where creativity is our true capital.

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:49.243
And a creative process like that --

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.966
I don't know how it works for you,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.681
but in my brain, it always starts
with a question:

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:54.859
Why?

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.407
Why does a jellyfish emit light?

00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.786
Or a firefly?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.056
Or why do be accept pollution?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.329
This is from my room
in Beijing three years ago.

00:03:04.353 --> 00:03:06.497
Left image is a good day -- Saturday.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.742
I can see the cars
and the people, the birds;

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.358
life is OK in a dense urban city.

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:13.214
And on the right image --

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:15.038
holy moly.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.075
Pollution -- complete layers.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.807
I couldn't even see
the other side of the city.

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:21.667
And this image made me really sad.

00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:24.740
This is not the bright future
we envision here at TED --

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:25.937
this is the horror.

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.712
We live five to six years shorter;

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:30.425
children have lung cancer
when they're six years old.

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:33.314
And so in a weird, beautiful way,

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.492
I, at that moment, became inspired
by Beijing smog.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.332
And the governments all around the world
are fighting their war on smog,

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:43.994
but I wanted to make something
within the now.

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:47.816
So we decided to build
the largest smog vacuum cleaner

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.251
in the world.

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:51.224
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it

00:03:51.248 --> 00:03:52.672
and then releases it.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.386
And we built the first one.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.502
So it sucks up 30,000
cubic meters per hour,

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:01.313
cleans it on the nano level --
the PM2.5, PM10 particles --

00:04:01.337 --> 00:04:03.312
using very little electricity,

00:04:03.336 --> 00:04:05.803
and then releases the clean air,

00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:11.280
so we have parks, playgrounds,
which are 55 to 75 percent more clean

00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:12.871
than the rest of the city.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.564
(Applause)

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.016
Yes!

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.557
(Applause)

00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.478
And every month or so,

00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:24.393
it opens like a spaceship --

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:27.076
like a Marilyn Monroe with the --
well, you know what.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.290
Anyway.

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:29.390
(Laughter)

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.864
So this ...

00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:32.835
this is the stuff we are capturing.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.057
This is Beijing smog.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.378
This is in our lungs right now.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.824
If you live next to a highway,
it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:41.998
Are we insane?

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.605
When did we say yes to that?

00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:47.271
And we had buckets
of this disgusting material

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:48.839
in our studio,

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:51.672
and on a Monday morning,
we were discussing, we were like,

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:54.546
"Shit, what should we do with it?
Should we throw it away?"

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.725
Like, "Help!"

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.910
And then we realized:
no, no, no, no, no --

00:04:57.934 --> 00:04:59.126
waste should not exist.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.578
Waste for the one should be
food for the other.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.502
So, here, maybe show it around.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.433
Do not put this in your coffee.

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.468
(Laughter)

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:10.503
And we realized that 42 percent
is made out of carbon,

00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:12.695
and carbon, of course,
under high pressure,

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.990
you get ...

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.275
diamonds.

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:20.430
So, inspired by that,
we compress it for 30 minutes --

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.541
(Cracking sound)

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:23.645
and make smog-free rings.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.692
(Laughter)

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.692
And so by sharing -- yeah, really!

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:28.354
And so by sharing a ring,

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.984
you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:32.673
to the city the tower is in.

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:33.709
(Applause)

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.963
I have one here --

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:36.167
(Applause)

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.058
A little floating cube.

00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:41.313
I will give one to you.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.567
I'm not going to propose, don't worry.

00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:44.879
(Laughter)

00:05:44.903 --> 00:05:46.068
Are we good?

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.334
You can show it around.

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:50.768
And we put this online --
Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:52.581
And people started to preorder it,

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:55.435
but more importantly,
they started to prepay it.

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.828
So the finance we made with the jewelry
helped us to realize,

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:00.477
to build the first tower.

00:06:00.873 --> 00:06:02.023
And that's powerful.

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:04.684
So the waste the activator,
it was the enabler.

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:06.718
Also, the feedback from the community --

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.558
this is a wedding couple from India,

00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:11.043
where he proposed to her
with the smog-free ring

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:12.340
as a sign of true beauty,

00:06:12.364 --> 00:06:14.233
as a sign of hope.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:16.095
And she said yes.

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:17.834
(Laughter)

00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:21.341
I love this image so much
for a lot of different reasons.

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.592
(Laughter)

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:25.311
And right now, the project
is touring through China,

00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:28.207
actually with the support
of China's central government.

00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:31.324
So the first goal is to create
local clean-air parks,

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:33.348
and that works already quite well --

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:35.632
55, 75 percent more clean.

00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:37.005
And at the same time,

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.426
we team up with the NGOs,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.614
with the governors,

00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:40.838
with the students,

00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:42.013
with the tech people,

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:45.392
to say, "Hey, what do we need to do
to make a whole city smog-free?"

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:47.199
It's about the dream of clean air.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.469
We do workshops. New ideas pop up.

00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:52.287
These are smog-free bicycles
which -- I'm Dutch, yes? --

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.750
I have this "bicycle DNA"
inside of me somewhere.

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:56.424
And so it sucks up polluted air,

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:58.007
it cleans it and releases it,

00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:59.524
in the fight against the car,

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:01.429
in the celebration of the bicycle.

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:05.614
And so right now, we're working
on a sort of "package deal," so to speak,

00:07:05.638 --> 00:07:08.892
where we say, "Smog-free towers,
smog-free rings."

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:11.412
We go to the mayors
or the governors of this world,

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:15.539
and say, "We can guarantee
a short-term reduction of pollution

00:07:15.563 --> 00:07:17.646
between 20 and 40 percent.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.567
Please sign here right now."

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:20.742
Yes?

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:22.493
(Applause)

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:23.667
Thank you.

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.521
(Applause)

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:30.472
So it's all about connecting
new technology with creative thinking.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:32.438
And if you start thinking about that,

00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:34.623
there is so much you can imagine,

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:36.170
so much more you can do.

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:39.505
We worked on dance floors
which produce electricity

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:40.788
when you dance on them.

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:43.290
We did the design for that -- 2008.

00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:45.309
So it moves eight or nine millimeters,

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.011
produces 25 watts.

00:07:47.035 --> 00:07:51.032
The electricity that we generate
is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.

00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:53.720
So some of the sustainability
is about doing more,

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:55.407
not about doing less.

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:56.917
But also on a larger scale,

00:07:56.941 --> 00:08:00.390
the Netherlands, where I'm
from, we live below sea level.

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:02.692
So because of these beauties --

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:08.156
the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers,
built by hand in 1932 --

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.947
we live with the water,

00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:11.501
we fight with the water,

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.671
we try to find harmony,

00:08:13.695 --> 00:08:15.596
but sometimes we forget.

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.106
And therefore, we made "Waterlicht,"

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.350
a combination of LEDs and lenses,

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:22.988
which show how high
the water level would be --

00:08:23.012 --> 00:08:24.293
global change --

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.384
if we stop.

00:08:26.408 --> 00:08:29.109
If, today, we all go home and we say,

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.554
"Oh, whatever, somebody else
will do it for us,"

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:33.598
or we'll wait for government or whomever.

00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:35.488
You know, we're not going to do that.

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:36.671
It goes wrong.

00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:39.411
And we placed this in public spaces
all around the world.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.026
Thousands of people showed up.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.298
(Applause)

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:43.472
Thank you.

00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:47.678
You're too nice, you're too nice.
That's not good for a designer.

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:49.702
So thousands of people showed up,

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.496
and some, actually, were scared.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.861
And they left; they experienced
the floods in 1953.

00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:56.277
And others were mesmerized.

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:58.120
Can we make floating cities?

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:01.631
Can we generate electricity
from the change in tides?

00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:04.995
So I think it's so important
to make experiences --

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:06.553
collective experiences --

00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:10.231
where people feel connected
with a vision, with a future

00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:12.025
and trigger what is possible.

00:09:12.822 --> 00:09:14.192
At the same time,

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:18.710
you know, these kinds of things --
they're not easy, yes?

00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:19.988
It's a struggle.

00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:21.678
And what I experienced in my life

00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:24.101
is that a lot of people say
they want innovation,

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:26.723
and they want the next
and the new, the future.

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:29.784
But the moment you present a new idea,

00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:34.194
there's this weird tendency
to reply to every new idea

00:09:34.218 --> 00:09:36.572
starting with two words.

00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:38.650
Which are?

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:40.020
(Audience guesses)

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:42.226
No, not "How much?" It's more annoying.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.258
(Laughter)

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.435
What is it, guys?

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.000
Or you're really blessed people?
That's really good.

00:09:47.024 --> 00:09:48.220
"Yes, but." Very good.

00:09:48.244 --> 00:09:51.936
"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too
cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.443
it's too beautiful, it's too ugly,
it cannot be done, it already exists."

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:57.554
I heard everything about the same project

00:09:57.578 --> 00:09:58.738
in the same week.

00:09:58.762 --> 00:10:00.691
And I got really, really annoyed.

00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:04.953
I got a bit of gray hair, started to dress
in black like a true architect.

00:10:04.977 --> 00:10:07.425
(Laughter)

00:10:07.449 --> 00:10:10.907
And one morning I woke up
and I said, "Daan, stop.

00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:12.282
This is dragging you down.

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:14.061
You have to do something with this.

00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.780
You have to use it
as an ingredient, as a component."

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:18.769
And so we decided to build,

00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:22.776
to realize the famous "Yes, but" chair.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.437
(Laughter)

00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:29.815
And this is an existing chair
by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.623
But we gave it a little "update,"

00:10:32.647 --> 00:10:34.978
a little "hack," so to speak.

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:38.296
We placed a little voice-recognition
element right here.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.897
So the moment you sit on that chair,

00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:45.207
and you say those two horrible,

00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:49.681
creative-destructive,
annoying little words --

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:50.796
(Laughter)

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.475
you get a short --

00:10:52.499 --> 00:10:54.122
(Laughter)

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.719
but pretty intense

00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:58.558
little shock on the back side
of your bottom.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:10:59.739
(Laughter)

00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:01.152
(Applause)

00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:02.347
And --

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.399
(Applause)

00:11:03.423 --> 00:11:05.221
and that works; yeah, that works.

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:08.020
Some clients have left us,
they got really mad.

00:11:08.044 --> 00:11:10.025
Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.

00:11:10.049 --> 00:11:12.436
And, of course, we also
apply it to ourselves.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.606
But ladies and gentlemen,
let's not be afraid.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.401
Let's be curious, yes?

00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:19.943
And, you know, walking
through TED in these days

00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:21.666
and hearing the other speakers

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.110
and feeling the energy of the crowd,

00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:28.433
I was remembering this quote
of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,

00:11:28.457 --> 00:11:30.472
who once famously said,

00:11:30.496 --> 00:11:32.375
"On spacecraft earth,

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.915
there are no passengers.

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:36.487
We are all crew."

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:39.244
And I think this so beautiful.

00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:40.720
This is so beautiful!

00:11:40.744 --> 00:11:42.990
We're not just consumers; we're makers:

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:44.220
we make decisions,

00:11:44.244 --> 00:11:45.415
we make new inventions,

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:46.669
we make new dreams.

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:48.237
And I think

00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:52.326
if we start implementing
that kind of thinking even more

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.892
within today,

00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:57.199
there's still a whole new world
to be explored.

00:11:58.545 --> 00:11:59.979
All right, thank you.

00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:02.131
(Applause)

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.305
Thank you.

00:12:03.329 --> 00:12:05.329
(Applause)
