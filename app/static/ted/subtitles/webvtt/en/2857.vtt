00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.948
So, my mother's a pediatrician,

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.786
and when I was young,
she'd tell the craziest stories

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.033
that combined science
with her overactive imagination.

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.775
One of the stories she told
was that if you eat a lot of salt,

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.468
all of the blood rushes up your legs,

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:20.744
through your body,

00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:22.847
and shoots out the top of your head,

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:24.573
killing you instantly.

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:25.657
(Laughter)

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.493
She called it "high blood pressure."

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:29.161
(Laughter)

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.095
This was my first experience
with science fiction,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.404
and I loved it.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.078
So when I started to write
my own science fiction and fantasy,

00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:39.596
I was surprised that it
was considered un-African.

00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:42.909
So naturally, I asked, what is African?

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.793
And this is what I know so far:

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:47.257
Africa is important.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:49.454
Africa is the future.

00:00:49.478 --> 00:00:50.744
It is, though.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:55.577
And Africa is a serious place
where only serious things happen.

00:00:55.601 --> 00:01:00.076
So when I present my work somewhere,
someone will always ask,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.671
"What's so important about it?

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.214
How does it deal with real African issues

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:10.606
like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?"

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.839
And it doesn't.

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:17.624
My work is about Nairobi pop bands
that want to go to space

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:20.776
or about seven-foot-tall robots

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.272
that fall in love.

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.886
It's nothing incredibly important.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.293
It's just fun, fierce and frivolous,

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.928
as frivolous as bubble gum --

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:33.287
"AfroBubbleGum."

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.686
So I'm not saying that
agenda art isn't important;

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.985
I'm the chairperson of a charity

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.966
that deals with films and theaters
that write about HIV and radicalization

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.253
and female genital mutilation.

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:51.558
It's vital and important art,

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:55.134
but it cannot be the only art
that comes out of the continent.

00:01:56.372 --> 00:01:58.708
We have to tell more stories

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:00.147
that are vibrant.

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:05.228
The danger of the single story
is still being realized.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.878
And maybe it's because of the funding.

00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:11.805
A lot of art is still dependent
on developmental aid.

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.695
So art becomes a tool for agenda.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.328
Or maybe it's because we've only seen
one image of ourselves for so long

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:22.799
that that's all we know how to create.

00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:25.996
Whatever the reason, we need a new way,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.865
and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.867
It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.665
It's the advocacy of art
that is not policy-driven

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.221
or agenda-driven

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:39.184
or based on education,

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:42.574
just for the sake of imagination:

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:44.151
AfroBubbleGum art.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.215
And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.285
We have to judge our work
for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.562
We have to have tests
that are similar to the Bechdel test,

00:02:57.364 --> 00:02:59.077
and ask questions like:

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:03.223
Are two or more Africans
in this piece of fiction healthy?

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:10.291
Are those same Africans financially stable
and not in need of saving?

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:14.261
Are they having fun and enjoying life?

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:17.383
And if we can answer yes
to two or more of these questions,

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:19.378
then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:21.584
(Laughter)

00:03:21.608 --> 00:03:26.385
(Applause)

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.898
And fun is political,

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:32.699
because imagine if we have
images of Africans who were vibrant

00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:34.766
and loving and thriving

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.078
and living a beautiful, vibrant life.

00:03:37.102 --> 00:03:39.483
What would we think of ourselves then?

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:42.354
Would we think that maybe
we're worthy of more happiness?

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.818
Would we think of our shared humanity
through our shared joy?

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:49.497
I think of these things when I create.

00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:53.148
I think of the people and the places
that give me immeasurable joy,

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:55.155
and I work to represent them.

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:56.816
And that's why I write stories

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.310
about futuristic girls that risk
everything to save plants

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:03.563
or to race camels

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:06.027
or even just to dance,

00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:07.772
to honor fun,

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:09.919
because my world is mostly happy.

00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:13.713
And I know happiness is a privilege
in this current splintered world

00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:17.491
where remaining hopeful
requires diligence.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:24.628
But maybe, if you join me
in creating, curating and commissioning

00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:26.681
more AfroBubbleGum art,

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.483
there might be hope
for a different view of the world,

00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:31.663
a happy Africa view

00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:33.715
where children are strangely traumatized

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:35.682
by their mother's dark sense of humor,

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:36.743
(Laughter)

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:41.329
but also they're claiming fun,
fierce and frivolous art

00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:45.558
in the name of all things
unseriously African.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.712
Because we're AfroBubbleGumists

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:51.589
and there's so many more of us
than you can imagine.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.294
Thank you so much.

00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:57.149
(Applause)
