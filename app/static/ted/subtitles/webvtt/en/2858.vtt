WEBVTT

00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:05.965
Someday, we may have robots
as smart as people,

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.463
artificial intelligence, AI.

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:09.963
How could that happen?

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:13.996
One route is that we'll just keep
accumulating better software,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.012
like we've been doing for 70 years.

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.479
At past rates of progress,
that may take centuries.

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:22.488
Some say it'll happen a lot faster

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:26.003
as we discover grand new
powerful theories of intelligence.

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:27.606
I'm skeptical.

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.669
But a third scenario

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:33.520
is what I'm going to talk about today.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:36.282
The idea is to port the software
from the human brain.

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:40.273
To do this, we're going to need
three technologies to be good enough,

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:41.852
and none of them are there yet.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:47.131
First, we're going to need
lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:53.062
Second, we're going to need
to scan individual human brains

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.324
in fine spatial and chemical detail,

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.376
to see exactly what cells are where,
connected to what, of what type.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.756
And third, we're going to need
computer models

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.002
of how each kind of brain cell works --

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.582
taking input signals,
changing interval state

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:10.900
and sending output signals.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:14.742
If we have good enough models
of all the kinds of brain cells

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.529
and a good enough model of the brain,

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:19.987
we can put it together to make
a good enough model of an entire brain,

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.014
and that model would have the same
input-output behavior as the original.

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:26.523
So if you talk to it, it might talk back.

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:28.644
If you ask it to do things,
it might do them.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.490
And if we could do that,
everything would change.

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:34.082
People have been talking
about this idea for decades,

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:35.895
under the name of "uploads."

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:37.403
I'm going to call them "ems."

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.959
When they talk about it, they say,

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:42.527
"Is this even possible?

00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:46.189
If you made one, would it be conscious?
Or is it just an empty machine?

00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:48.665
If you made one of me,
is that me or someone else?"

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:52.138
These are all fascinating questions
that I'm going to ignore ...

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.527
(Laughter)

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.130
because I see a neglected question:

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:58.764
What would actually happen?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.344
I became obsessed with this question.

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.946
I spent four years trying to analyze it,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.517
using standard academic tools,
to guess what would happen,

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:12.390
and I'm here to tell you what I found.

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:14.310
But be warned --

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:18.129
I'm not offering inspiration,
I'm offering analysis.

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.947
I see my job as telling you
what's most likely to happen

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:22.748
if we did the least to avoid it.

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:27.434
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed
by something I tell you here,

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.052
you're just not paying attention.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:30.427
(Laughter)

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.047
OK, the first thing I can tell you

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:36.204
is that ems spend most
of their life in virtual reality.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.303
This is what you might look like
if you were using virtual reality.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:44.224
And this is what you might see:

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:48.840
sunlight glinting off of water,
you might hear gulls flying above,

00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:51.895
you might even feel the wind
on your cheeks or smell seawater,

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.244
with advanced hardware.

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:56.179
Now, if you were to spend
a lot of time here,

00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:57.469
you might want a dashboard

00:02:57.493 --> 00:02:59.987
where you could do things like
make a phone call,

00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.561
move to a new virtual world,

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.885
check your bank account.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.617
Now, while this is what
you would look like in virtual reality,

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.769
this is what an em
would look like in virtual reality.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:13.549
It's computer hardware
sitting in a server rack somewhere.

00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:16.731
But still, it could see
and experience the same thing.

00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:19.112
But some things are different for ems.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.476
First, while you'll probably always notice
that virtual reality isn't entirely real,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.754
to an em, it can feel as real to them
as this room feels to you now

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:29.416
or as anything ever feels.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.852
And ems also have
some more action possibilities.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.105
For example, your mind just always
runs at the same speed,

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.970
but an em can add more or less
computer hardware to run faster or slower,

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:42.682
and therefore, if the world around them
seems to be going too fast,

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:44.325
they can just speed up their mind,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.699
and the world around them
would seem to slow down.

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:51.564
In addition, an em can make
a copy of itself at that moment.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.217
This copy would remember
everything the same,

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:57.557
and if it starts out with the same speed,
looking at the same speed,

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.232
it might even need to be told,
"You are the copy."

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.352
And em could make archive copies,

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.200
and with enough archives,

00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:06.296
an em can be immortal --

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.510
in principle, though not
usually in practice.

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.943
And an em can move its brain,
the computer that represents its brain,

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.054
from one physical location to another.

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:19.355
Ems can actually move around the world
at the speed of light,

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.911
and by moving to a new location,

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:24.199
they can interact more quickly
with ems near that new location.

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:28.500
So far, I've been talking about
what ems can do.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.127
What do ems choose to do?

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:35.382
To understand that, we'll need
to understand three key facts.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:42.247
First, ems by definition do what
the human they emulate would do

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.572
in the same situation.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:46.948
So their lives and behavior
are very human.

00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:50.269
They're mainly different because
they're living in a different world.

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:53.591
Second, ems need
real resources to survive.

00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:57.278
You need food and shelter or you'll die.

00:04:57.302 --> 00:05:01.612
Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can't exist.

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:04.211
For every subjective minute
that an em experiences,

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:07.509
someone, usually that em,
had to work to pay for it.

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.826
Third, ems are poor.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:14.350
The em population can grow
quicker than the em economy,

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:17.709
so that means wages fall down
to em subsistence levels.

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:20.337
That means ems have to be working
most of the time.

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:23.289
So that means
this is what ems usually see:

00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:26.232
beautiful and luxurious, but desks --

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:27.980
they're working most of the time.

00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:32.252
Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
you might think, is exotic and strange,

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:34.617
but it's actually the usual case
in human history,

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.355
and it's how pretty much
all wild animals have ever lived,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.655
so we know what humans do
in this situation.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.609
Humans basically do
what it takes to survive,

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.942
and this is what lets me say
so much about the em world.

00:05:46.752 --> 00:05:49.141
When creatures are rich, like you,

00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:51.188
you have to know a lot
about what they want

00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:52.553
to figure out what they do.

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:53.747
When creatures are poor,

00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.428
you know that they mostly do
what it takes to survive.

00:05:56.776 --> 00:06:00.400
So we've been talking about the em world
from the point of view of the ems --

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.939
now, let's step back
and look at their whole world.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:06.043
First, the em world grows
much faster than ours,

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.531
roughly a hundred times faster.

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.718
So the amount of change
we would experience in a century or two,

00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:13.600
they would experience in a year or two.

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.662
And I'm not really willing to project
this age much beyond that,

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:20.123
because plausibly by then something else
will happen, I don't know what.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.505
Second, the typical emulation
runs even faster,

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.718
roughly a thousand times human speed.

00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:30.656
So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.872
and for them, the world around them
is actually changing more slowly

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.838
than your world seems to change for you.

00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:40.761
Third, ems are crammed together
in a small number of very dense cities.

00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:44.251
This is not only how they see
themselves in virtual reality,

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:47.171
it's also how they actually are
physically crammed together.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:51.360
So at em speeds, physical travel
feels really painfully slow,

00:06:51.384 --> 00:06:53.706
so most em cities are self-sufficient,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.480
most war is cyber war,

00:06:55.504 --> 00:06:58.195
and most of the rest of the earth
away from the em cities

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.893
is left to the humans, because the ems
really aren't that interested in it.

00:07:02.252 --> 00:07:03.760
Speaking of humans,

00:07:03.784 --> 00:07:05.568
you were wanting to hear about that.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:10.058
Humans must retire, at once, for good.

00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:12.410
They just can't compete.

00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:15.990
Now, humans start out owning
all of the capital in this world.

00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:18.883
The economy grows very fast,
their wealth grows very fast.

00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:21.291
Humans get rich, collectively.

00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:25.467
As you may know, most humans today
don't actually own that much

00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:27.332
besides their ability to work,

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:30.904
so between now and then,
they need to acquire sufficient assets,

00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:32.761
insurance or sharing arrangements,

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.246
or they may starve.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.285
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:37.594
(Laughter)

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:39.688
Now, you might wonder,

00:07:39.712 --> 00:07:41.190
why would ems let humans exist?

00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:42.929
Why not kill them, take their stuff?

00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.778
But notice we have many
unproductive retirees around us today,

00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:48.907
and we don't kill them
and take their stuff.

00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:50.565
(Laughter)

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:55.009
In part, that's because it would disrupt
the institutions we share with them.

00:07:55.524 --> 00:07:57.640
Other groups would wonder who's next,

00:07:57.664 --> 00:08:02.390
so plausibly, ems may well let humans
retire in peace during the age of em.

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:05.463
You should worry more that
the age of em only lasts a year or two

00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:07.315
and you don't know what happens next.

00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:11.573
Ems are very much like humans,

00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:13.906
but they are not like the typical human.

00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:20.421
The typical em is a copy
of the few hundred most productive humans.

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:24.909
So in fact, they are as elite,
compared to the typical human,

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:27.195
as the typical billionaire,
Nobel Prize winner,

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.568
Olympic gold medalist, head of state.

00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:34.829
Ems look on humans
perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,

00:08:34.853 --> 00:08:36.361
but not so much respect,

00:08:36.385 --> 00:08:39.580
which is, if you think about it,
how you think about your ancestors.

00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:42.871
We know many things about how humans
differ in terms of productivity.

00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:45.314
We can just use those
to predict features of ems --

00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:48.434
for example, they tend to be smart,
conscientious, hard-working,

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:50.143
married, religious, middle-aged.

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:52.073
These are features of ems.

00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:54.325
Em world also contains enormous variety.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.378
Not only does it continue on with most
of the kinds of variety that humans do,

00:08:58.402 --> 00:09:00.797
including variety of industry
and profession,

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:02.983
they also have many new kinds of variety,

00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:05.352
and one of the most important
is mind speed.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:09.546
Ems can plausibly go from human speed

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.450
up to a million times
faster than human speed,

00:09:12.474 --> 00:09:15.251
and down to a billion times
slower than human speed.

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:18.992
Faster ems tend to have
markers of high status.

00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:21.176
They embody more wealth.
They win arguments.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.863
They sit at premium locations.

00:09:22.887 --> 00:09:24.707
Slower ems are mostly retirees,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.981
and they are like the ghosts
of our literature.

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.046
If you recall, ghosts are all around us --

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.340
you can interact with them
if you pay the price.

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.793
But they don't know much,
they can't influence much,

00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:36.515
and they're obsessed with the past,
so what's the point?

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:37.690
(Laughter)

00:09:37.714 --> 00:09:40.671
Ems also have more variety
in the structure of their lives.

00:09:40.695 --> 00:09:43.377
This is your life: you start
and you end, really simple.

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:45.014
This is the life of an em,

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:47.331
who every day splits off
some short-term copies

00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.313
to do short-term tasks and then end.

00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:53.464
We'll talk more about
those short term versions in a moment,

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:55.098
but they are much more efficient

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:57.487
because they don't have to rest
for the next day.

00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:59.019
This em is more opportunistic.

00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:02.330
They make more copies of themselves
when there's more demand for that.

00:10:02.354 --> 00:10:04.451
They don't know which way
the future's going.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:05.774
This is an em designer,

00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:07.400
who conceives of a large system

00:10:07.424 --> 00:10:10.909
and then breaks recursively into copies
who elaborate that,

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:14.345
so ems can implement
larger, more coherent designs.

00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:15.727
This an emulation plumber

00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.196
who remembers that every day,
for the last 20 years,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.001
they only ever worked
two hours a day, a life of leisure.

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:24.122
But what really happened is,
every day they had a thousand copies,

00:10:24.146 --> 00:10:26.099
each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:28.288
and only one of them
went on to the next day.

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:31.311
Objectively, they're working
well over 99 percent of the time.

00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.525
Subjectively, they remember
a life of leisure.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:34.557
(Laughter)

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:36.669
This, again, is you.
You start and you end.

00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:38.805
This could be you
if at the start of party,

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:41.640
you took a drug that meant
you would not remember that party

00:10:41.664 --> 00:10:43.282
ever after that day.

00:10:43.306 --> 00:10:45.235
Some people do this, I'm told.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.305
Toward the end of the party,

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:50.255
will you say to yourself,
"I'm about to die, this is terrible.

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:53.582
That person tomorrow isn't me,
because they won't remember what I do."

00:10:53.606 --> 00:10:57.567
Or you could say, "I will go on tomorrow.
I just won't remember what I did."

00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.020
This is an em who splits off
a short-term copy

00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:01.908
to do a short-term task and then end.

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:04.138
They have the same two
attitude possibilities.

00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:07.841
They can say, "I'm a new short-term
creature with a short life. I hate this."

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:10.999
Or "I'm a part of a larger creature
who won't remember this part."

00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:13.141
I predict they'll have
that second attitude,

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:16.841
not because it's philosophically correct,
but because it helps them get along.

00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:19.193
Today, if the president says
we must invade Iraq,

00:11:19.217 --> 00:11:20.368
and you say, "Why?"

00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:21.774
and they say, "State secret,"

00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:23.648
you're not sure if you can trust them,

00:11:23.672 --> 00:11:27.288
but for ems, a copy of the president
and a copy of you can go inside a safe,

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.966
explain all their secret reasons,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.521
and then one bit comes out
from your copy to yourself,

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:33.401
telling you if you were convinced.

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.648
So now you can know
there is a good reason.

00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:38.521
I know you guys are all eager
to evaluate this world.

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:40.879
You're eager to decide
if you love it or hate it.

00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:43.446
But think: your ancestors
from thousands of years ago

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.223
would have loved or hated your world

00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:47.668
based on the first few things
they heard about it,

00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:49.545
because your world
is really just weird.

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:53.397
So before judging a strange future world,
you should really learn a lot about it,

00:11:53.417 --> 00:11:54.987
maybe read a whole book about it,

00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:57.375
and then, if you don't like it,
work to change it.

00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:58.428
Thank you.

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:03.285
(Applause)
