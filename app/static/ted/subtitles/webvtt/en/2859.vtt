00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.896
Whether you like it or not,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.296
radical transparency and algorithmic
decision-making is coming at you fast,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.296
and it's going to change your life.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.136
That's because it's now easy
to take algorithms

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.056
and embed them into computers

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.016
and gather all that data
that you're leaving on yourself

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.416
all over the place,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.136
and know what you're like,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.096
and then direct the computers
to interact with you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.240
in ways that are better
than most people can.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.776
Well, that might sound scary.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.440
I've been doing this for a long time
and I have found it to be wonderful.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.816
My objective has been
to have meaningful work

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.696
and meaningful relationships
with the people I work with,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.776
and I've learned that I couldn't have that

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.080
unless I had that radical transparency
and that algorithmic decision-making.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.696
I want to show you why that is,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.416
I want to show you how it works.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.536
And I warn you that some of the things
that I'm going to show you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.227
probably are a little bit shocking.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240
Since I was a kid,
I've had a terrible rote memory.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.296
And I didn't like following instructions,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.736
I was no good at following instructions.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
But I loved to figure out
how things worked for myself.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.056
When I was 12,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.360
I hated school but I fell in love
with trading the markets.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.576
I caddied at the time,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.176
earned about five dollars a bag.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.400
And I took my caddying money,
and I put it in the stock market.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.616
And that was just because
the stock market was hot at the time.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.096
And the first company I bought

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.720
was a company by the name
of Northeast Airlines.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.096
Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.816
that was selling for less
than five dollars a share.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.816
(Laughter)

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.696
And I figured I could buy more shares,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.816
and if it went up, I'd make more money.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680
So, it was a dumb strategy, right?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.816
But I tripled my money,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.960
and I tripled my money
because I got lucky.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.336
The company was about to go bankrupt,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.456
but some other company acquired it,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.936
and I tripled my money.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.160
And I was hooked.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.000
And I thought, "This game is easy."

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.416
With time,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400
I learned this game is anything but easy.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.016
In order to be an effective investor,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.936
one has to bet against the consensus

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.216
and be right.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.096
And it's not easy to bet
against the consensus and be right.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.456
One has to bet against
the consensus and be right

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.120
because the consensus
is built into the price.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.576
And in order to be an entrepreneur,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.216
a successful entrepreneur,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.720
one has to bet against
the consensus and be right.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.336
I had to be an entrepreneur
and an investor --

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.560
and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.256
So I made a lot of painful mistakes,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.536
and with time,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.520
my attitude about those mistakes
began to change.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.256
I began to think of them as puzzles.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.216
That if I could solve the puzzles,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.680
they would give me gems.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.816
And the puzzles were:

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.720
What would I do differently in the future
so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.856
And the gems were principles

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.016
that I would then write down
so I would remember them

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.612
that would help me in the future.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.696
And because I wrote them down so clearly,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.056
I could then --

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.656
eventually discovered --

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.440
I could then embed them into algorithms.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.856
And those algorithms
would be embedded in computers,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.216
and the computers would
make decisions along with me;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.376
and so in parallel,
we would make these decisions.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.376
And I could see how those decisions
then compared with my own decisions,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.496
and I could see that
those decisions were a lot better.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.256
And that was because the computer
could make decisions much faster,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.536
it could process a lot more information

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.960
and it can process decisions much more --

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.080
less emotionally.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.680
So it radically improved
my decision-making.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.336
Eight years after I started Bridgewater,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.896
I had my greatest failure,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.120
my greatest mistake.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.816
It was late 1970s,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.816
I was 34 years old,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.496
and I had calculated that American banks

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.376
had lent much more money
to emerging countries

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.216
than those countries
were going to be able to pay back

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.936
and that we would have
the greatest debt crisis

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.320
since the Great Depression.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.416
And with it, an economic crisis

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480
and a big bear market in stocks.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.680
It was a controversial view at the time.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.600
People thought it was
kind of a crazy point of view.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.696
But in August 1982,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.680
Mexico defaulted on its debt,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.776
and a number of other countries followed.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.200
And we had the greatest debt crisis
since the Great Depression.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.856
And because I had anticipated that,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.216
I was asked to testify to Congress
and appear on "Wall Street Week,"

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.216
which was the show of the time.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.176
Just to give you a flavor of that,
I've got a clip here,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.120
and you'll see me in there.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.176
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.576
it's a great pleasure and a great honor
to be able to appear before you

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.080
in examination with what
is going wrong with our economy.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.576
The economy is now flat --

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.736
teetering on the brink of failure.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.256
Martin Zweig: You were recently
quoted in an article.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.616
You said, "I can say this
with absolute certainty

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.256
because I know how markets work."

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.376
Ray Dalio: I can say
with absolute certainty

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.256
that if you look at the liquidity base

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.656
in the corporations
and the world as a whole,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.776
that there's such reduced
level of liquidity

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.016
that you can't return
to an era of stagflation."

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.136
I look at that now, I think,
"What an arrogant jerk!"

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160
(Laughter)

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.216
I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.816
I mean, while the debt crisis happened,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.816
the stock market and the economy
went up rather than going down,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.856
and I lost so much money
for myself and for my clients

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.296
that I had to shut down
my operation pretty much,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.200
I had to let almost everybody go.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.376
And these were like extended family,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.016
I was heartbroken.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.856
And I had lost so much money

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.216
that I had to borrow
4,000 dollars from my dad

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.160
to help to pay my family bills.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.000
It was one of the most painful
experiences of my life ...

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.016
but it turned out to be
one of the greatest experiences of my life

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.720
because it changed my attitude
about decision-making.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.416
Rather than thinking, "I'm right,"

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.016
I started to ask myself,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.840
"How do I know I'm right?"

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.416
I gained a humility that I needed

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.000
in order to balance my audacity.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.096
I wanted to find the smartest
people who would disagree with me

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.016
to try to understand their perspective

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.640
or to have them
stress test my perspective.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.176
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.416
In other words,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.256
not an autocracy in which
I would lead and others would follow

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.896
and not a democracy in which everybody's
points of view were equally valued,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.016
but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy
in which the best ideas would win out.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.296
And in order to do that,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.896
I realized that we would need
radical truthfulness

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.536
and radical transparency.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.416
What I mean by radical truthfulness
and radical transparency

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.096
is people needed to say
what they really believed

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120
and to see everything.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.416
And we literally
tape almost all conversations

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.056
and let everybody see everything,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.496
because if we didn't do that,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.600
we couldn't really have
an idea meritocracy.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.456
In order to have an idea meritocracy,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.856
we have let people speak
and say what they want.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.256
Just to give you an example,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.976
this is an email from Jim Haskel --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.376
somebody who works for me --

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.776
and this was available
to everybody in the company.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.336
"Ray, you deserve a 'D-'

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.616
for your performance
today in the meeting ...

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.336
you did not prepare at all well

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.920
because there is no way
you could have been that disorganized."

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.736
Isn't that great?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.976
(Laughter)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.216
That's great.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.176
It's great because, first of all,
I needed feedback like that.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.816
I need feedback like that.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.296
And it's great because if I don't let Jim,
and people like Jim,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.896
to express their points of view,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.976
our relationship wouldn't be the same.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.056
And if I didn't make that public
for everybody to see,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.040
we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.040
So for that last 25 years
that's how we've been operating.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.696
We've been operating
with this radical transparency

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.016
and then collecting these principles,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.096
largely from making mistakes,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.536
and then embedding
those principles into algorithms.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.256
And then those algorithms provide --

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.296
we're following the algorithms

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.760
in parallel with our thinking.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.456
That has been how we've run
the investment business,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.216
and it's how we also deal
with the people management.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.976
In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.336
I'd like to take you into a meeting

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.496
and introduce you to a tool of ours
called the "Dot Collector"

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.800
that helps us do this.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.816
A week after the US election,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.936
our research team held a meeting

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.280
to discuss what a Trump presidency
would mean for the US economy.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.856
Naturally, people had
different opinions on the matter

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.920
and how we were
approaching the discussion.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.616
The "Dot Collector" collects these views.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.936
It has a list of a few dozen attributes,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.976
so whenever somebody thinks something
about another person's thinking,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.936
it's easy for them
to convey their assessment;

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.480
they simply note the attribute
and provide a rating from one to 10.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.776
For example, as the meeting began,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.920
a researcher named Jen rated me a three --

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.656
in other words, badly --

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.056
(Laughter)

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.240
for not showing a good balance
of open-mindedness and assertiveness.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.536
As the meeting transpired,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.800
Jen's assessments of people
added up like this.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.096
Others in the room
have different opinions.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.336
That's normal.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.280
Different people are always
going to have different opinions.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.200
And who knows who's right?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.680
Let's look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.816
Some people thought I did well,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.040
others, poorly.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.416
With each of these views,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.760
we can explore the thinking
behind the numbers.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.680
Here's what Jen and Larry said.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.376
Note that everyone
gets to express their thinking,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.056
including their critical thinking,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.200
regardless of their position
in the company.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.216
Jen, who's 24 years old
and right out of college,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.080
can tell me, the CEO,
that I'm approaching things terribly.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.256
This tool helps people
both express their opinions

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.376
and then separate themselves
from their opinions

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.440
to see things from a higher level.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.536
When Jen and others shift their attentions
from inputting their own opinions

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.136
to looking down on the whole screen,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.880
their perspective changes.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.816
They see their own opinions
as just one of many

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.376
and naturally start asking themselves,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.400
"How do I know my opinion is right?"

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.536
That shift in perspective is like going
from seeing in one dimension

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.816
to seeing in multiple dimensions.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.936
And it shifts the conversation
from arguing over our opinions

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.360
to figuring out objective criteria
for determining which opinions are best.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.520
Behind the "Dot Collector"
is a computer that is watching.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.296
It watches what all
these people are thinking

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.896
and it correlates that
with how they think.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.440
And it communicates advice
back to each of them based on that.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.936
Then it draws the data
from all the meetings

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.176
to create a pointilist painting
of what people are like

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.440
and how they think.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.880
And it does that guided by algorithms.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.560
Knowing what people are like helps
to match them better with their jobs.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.336
For example,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.096
a creative thinker who is unreliable

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.200
might be matched up with someone
who's reliable but not creative.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.616
Knowing what people are like
also allows us to decide

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.896
what responsibilities to give them

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.400
and to weigh our decisions
based on people's merits.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.640
We call it their believability.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.536
Here's an example of a vote that we took

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.400
where the majority
of people felt one way ...

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.856
but when we weighed the views
based on people's merits,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.720
the answer was completely different.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.496
This process allows us to make decisions
not based on democracy,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.656
not based on autocracy,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.920
but based on algorithms that take
people's believability into consideration.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.216
Yup, we really do this.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.536
(Laughter)

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.416
We do it because it eliminates

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.896
what I believe to be
one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.080
and that is people arrogantly,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.216
naïvely holding opinions
in their minds that are wrong,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.496
and acting on them,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.280
and not putting them out there
to stress test them.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.336
And that's a tragedy.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.776
And we do it because it elevates ourselves
above our own opinions

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.696
so that we start to see things
through everybody's eyes,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.640
and we see things collectively.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.696
Collective decision-making is so much
better than individual decision-making

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.920
if it's done well.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.976
It's been the secret sauce
behind our success.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.176
It's why we've made
more money for our clients

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.136
than any other hedge fund in existence

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.880
and made money
23 out of the last 26 years.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.416
So what's the problem
with being radically truthful

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.680
and radically transparent with each other?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.480
People say it's emotionally difficult.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.480
Critics say it's a formula
for a brutal work environment.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.256
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do
with how are brains are prewired.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.496
There's a part of our brain
that would like to know our mistakes

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.480
and like to look at our weaknesses
so we could do better.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.560
I'm told that that's
the prefrontal cortex.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.896
And then there's a part of our brain
which views all of this as attacks.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.880
I'm told that that's the amygdala.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.496
In other words,
there are two you's inside you:

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.936
there's an emotional you

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.736
and there's an intellectual you,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.536
and often they're at odds,

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.480
and often they work against you.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.896
It's been our experience
that we can win this battle.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.240
We win it as a group.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.336
It takes about 18 months typically

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.416
to find that most people
prefer operating this way,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.456
with this radical transparency

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.816
than to be operating
in a more opaque environment.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.136
There's not politics,
there's not the brutality of --

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.536
you know, all of that hidden,
behind-the-scenes --

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.496
there's an idea meritocracy
where people can speak up.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.776
And that's been great.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.456
It's given us more effective work,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.880
and it's given us
more effective relationships.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.720
But it's not for everybody.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.616
We found something like
25 or 30 percent of the population

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.376
it's just not for.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.616
And by the way,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.456
when I say radical transparency,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.816
I'm not saying transparency
about everything.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.656
I mean, you don't have to tell somebody
that their bald spot is growing

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.296
or their baby's ugly.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.416
So, I'm just talking about --

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.656
(Laughter)

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.856
talking about the important things.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.096
So --

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.320
(Laughter)

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.016
So when you leave this room,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.480
I'd like you to observe yourself
in conversations with others.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.040
Imagine if you knew
what they were really thinking,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.360
and imagine if you knew
what they were really like ...

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.816
and imagine if they knew
what you were really thinking

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.680
and what were really like.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.736
It would certainly clear things up a lot

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.616
and make your operations
together more effective.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.880
I think it will improve
your relationships.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.896
Now imagine that you can have algorithms

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.736
that will help you gather
all of that information

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.320
and even help you make decisions
in an idea-meritocratic way.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.976
This sort of radical transparency
is coming at you

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.960
and it is going to affect your life.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.656
And in my opinion,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.016
it's going to be wonderful.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.376
So I hope it is as wonderful for you

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.600
as it is for me.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.416
Thank you very much.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.800
(Applause)
