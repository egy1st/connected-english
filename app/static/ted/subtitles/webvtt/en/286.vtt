00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.527
Probably a lot of you know
the story of the two salesmen

00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:06.469
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:09.133
They were sent down to find
if there was any opportunity

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.365
for selling shoes,

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.717
and they wrote telegrams
back to Manchester.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.551
And one of them wrote,

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.737
"Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:19.904
And the other one wrote,

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:22.936
"Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.260
(Laughter)

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.443
Now, there's a similar situation
in the classical music world,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:31.376
because there are some people who think
that classical music is dying.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.712
And there are some of us
who think you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.976
And rather than go
into statistics and trends,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.737
and tell you about all the orchestras
that are closing,

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.217
and the record companies that are folding,

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.593
I thought we should do
an experiment tonight.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.319
Actually, it's not really an experiment,
because I know the outcome.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.602
(Laughter)

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.022
But it's like an experiment.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.871
Now, before we start --

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:59.976
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.438
Before we start, I need to do two things.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:06.537
One is I want to remind you
of what a seven-year-old child

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.572
sounds like when he plays the piano.

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.705
Maybe you have this child at home.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.186
He sounds something like this.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.776
(Music)

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:32.289
(Music ends)

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:34.487
I see some of you recognize this child.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.536
Now, if he practices for a year
and takes lessons, he's now eight

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.742
and he sounds like this.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.091
(Music)

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:47.085
(Music ends)

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.976
He practices for another year
and takes lessons -- he's nine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.628
(Music)

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:56.641
(Music ends)

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:59.949
Then he practices for another year
and takes lessons -- now he's 10.

00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:02.194
(Music)

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.881
(Music ends)

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:07.658
At that point, they usually give up.

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:08.976
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.269
(Applause)

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:14.976
Now, if you'd waited for one more year,
you would have heard this.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.105
(Music)

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.405
(Music ends)

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.609
Now, what happened was not
maybe what you thought,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.432
which is, he suddenly
became passionate, engaged,

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:34.339
involved, got a new teacher,
he hit puberty, or whatever it is.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:37.861
What actually happened
was the impulses were reduced.

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:41.482
You see, the first time, he was playing
with an impulse on every note.

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:44.386
(Music)

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.758
And the second,
with an impulse every other note.

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:48.896
(Music)

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.816
You can see it by looking at my head.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.556
(Laughter)

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.852
The nine-year-old put
an impulse on every four notes.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.976
(Music)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.869
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:01.976
(Music)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.385
And the 11-year-old,
one impulse on the whole phrase.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.128
(Music)

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:10.620
I don't know how
we got into this position.

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:12.686
(Laughter)

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.833
I didn't say, "I'm going to move
my shoulder over, move my body."

00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:17.447
No, the music pushed me over,

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.796
which is why I call it
one-buttock playing.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.523
(Music)

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:22.903
It can be the other buttock.

00:03:22.927 --> 00:03:25.904
(Music)

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:29.872
You know, a gentleman was once
watching a presentation I was doing,

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.816
when I was working with a young pianist.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.175
He was the president
of a corporation in Ohio.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.462
I was working with
this young pianist, and said,

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.966
"The trouble with you
is you're a two-buttock player.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.750
You should be a one-buttock player."

00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:42.654
I moved his body while he was playing.

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:45.076
And suddenly, the music took off.
It took flight.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.548
The audience gasped
when they heard the difference.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:49.548
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:50.833
He said, "I was so moved.

00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:53.076
I went back and I transformed
my entire company

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.504
into a one-buttock company."

00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:57.976
(Laughter)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.896
Now, the other thing I wanted
to do is to tell you about you.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.976
There are 1,600 people, I believe.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.690
My estimation is that probably 45 of you

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:09.600
are absolutely passionate
about classical music.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:14.346
You adore classical music.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.976
You have CDs in your car,
and you go to the symphony,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.896
your children are playing instruments.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.595
You can't imagine your life
without classical music.

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:23.643
That's the first group, quite small.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.491
Then there's another bigger group.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.626
The people who don't mind classical music.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.660
(Laughter)

00:04:28.684 --> 00:04:30.729
You know, you've come home
from a long day,

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:33.436
and you take a glass of wine,
and you put your feet up.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.080
A little Vivaldi in the background
doesn't do any harm.

00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:37.445
That's the second group.

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:38.777
Now comes the third group:

00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.001
people who never listen
to classical music.

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.976
It's just simply not part of your life.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.845
You might hear it like second-hand
smoke at the airport ...

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:46.976
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.286
-- and maybe a little bit
of a march from "Aida"

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.690
when you come into the hall.

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:52.301
But otherwise, you never hear it.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.960
That's probably the largest group.

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:55.729
And then there's a very small group.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:58.571
These are the people
who think they're tone-deaf.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.325
Amazing number of people think
they're tone-deaf.

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.706
Actually, I hear a lot,
"My husband is tone-deaf."

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.731
(Laughter)

00:05:04.755 --> 00:05:06.810
Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.056
Nobody is tone-deaf.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.560
If you were tone-deaf,
you couldn't change the gears

00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:12.463
on your car, in a stick shift car.

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:14.400
You couldn't tell the difference between

00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:16.424
somebody from Texas
and somebody from Rome.

00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:18.958
And the telephone. The telephone.

00:05:18.982 --> 00:05:20.316
If your mother calls

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.516
on the miserable telephone,
she calls and says, "Hello,"

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.253
you not only know who it is,
you know what mood she's in.

00:05:26.841 --> 00:05:30.588
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.

00:05:30.612 --> 00:05:32.510
So nobody is tone-deaf.

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:33.685
But I tell you what.

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.663
It doesn't work for me
to go on with this thing,

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:40.433
with such a wide gulf
between those who understand,

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:42.863
love and are passionate
about classical music,

00:05:42.887 --> 00:05:45.609
and those who have
no relationship to it at all.

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:48.116
The tone-deaf people,
they're no longer here.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.110
But even between those three categories,

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:51.438
it's too wide a gulf.

00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:55.880
So I'm not going to go on
until every single person in this room,

00:05:55.904 --> 00:06:00.595
downstairs and in Aspen,
and everybody else looking,

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.464
will come to love
and understand classical music.

00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:06.683
So that's what we're going to do.

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:12.281
Now, you notice that there is not
the slightest doubt in my mind

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.025
that this is going to work,
if you look at my face, right?

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.976
It's one of the characteristics
of a leader that he not doubt

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.976
for one moment the capacity
of the people he's leading

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.163
to realize whatever he's dreaming.

00:06:25.893 --> 00:06:28.814
Imagine if Martin Luther King
had said, "I have a dream.

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:31.048
Of course, I'm not sure
they'll be up to it."

00:06:31.072 --> 00:06:33.976
(Laughter)

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.341
All right. So I'm going
to take a piece of Chopin.

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:38.626
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.666
Some of you will know it.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.508
(Music)

00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:13.434
Do you know what I think
probably happened here?

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:16.136
When I started, you thought,
"How beautiful that sounds."

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.532
(Music)

00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:31.071
"I don't think we should
go to the same place

00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:32.900
for our summer holidays next year."

00:07:32.924 --> 00:07:35.544
(Laughter)

00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:36.933
It's funny, isn't it?

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:42.203
It's funny how those thoughts
kind of waft into your head.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:43.457
And of course --

00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:45.341
(Applause)

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:48.176
Of course, if the piece is long
and you've had a long day,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.619
you might actually drift off.

00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.812
Then your companion
will dig you in the ribs

00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:54.867
and say, "Wake up! It's culture!"
And then you feel even worse.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.953
(Laughter)

00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:58.966
But has it ever occurred to you
that the reason you feel sleepy

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.802
in classical music is not
because of you, but because of us?

00:08:01.826 --> 00:08:03.663
Did anybody think while I was playing,

00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:05.647
"Why is he using so many impulses?"

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.778
If I'd done this with my head you
certainly would have thought it.

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:10.942
(Music)

00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:15.698
(Music ends)

00:08:15.722 --> 00:08:18.878
And for the rest of your life,
every time you hear classical music,

00:08:18.902 --> 00:08:22.682
you'll always be able to know
if you hear those impulses.

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:25.076
So let's see what's really going on here.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.013
We have a B. This is a B.

00:08:28.037 --> 00:08:29.322
The next note is a C.

00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:31.976
And the job of the C is to make the B sad.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.601
And it does, doesn't it?

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:35.373
(Laughter)

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:36.608
Composers know that.

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:39.211
If they want sad music,
they just play those two notes.

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:42.976
(Music)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.531
But basically, it's just a B,
with four sads.

00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:47.976
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.402
Now, it goes down to A.

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:52.436
Now to G.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.686
And then to F.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.769
So we have B, A, G, F.

00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:57.976
And if we have B, A, G, F,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.587
what do we expect next?

00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.721
(Music)

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.588
That might have been a fluke.

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:05.774
Let's try it again.

00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:08.563
(Music)

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:10.722
Oh, the TED choir.

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:13.904
(Laughter)

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.794
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?

00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:18.020
Nobody is.

00:09:18.044 --> 00:09:19.889
You know, every village in Bangladesh

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:24.771
and every hamlet in China
-- everybody knows:

00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:27.236
da, da, da, da -- da.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.212
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:31.435
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,

00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:32.990
because what will have happened?

00:09:33.814 --> 00:09:36.181
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?

00:09:36.205 --> 00:09:37.413
Act One, scene three,

00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:39.455
he finds out his uncle killed his father.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.217
He keeps on going up
to his uncle and almost killing him.

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:45.408
And then he backs away,
he goes up to him again, almost kills him.

00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:47.476
The critics sitting in the back row there,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.976
they have to have an opinion,
so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.525
Or they say, "Hamlet has
an Oedipus complex."

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.798
No, otherwise the play
would be over, stupid.

00:09:55.822 --> 00:09:56.907
(Laughter)

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.523
That's why Shakespeare puts
all that stuff in Hamlet --

00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:01.612
Ophelia going mad,
the play within the play,

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:03.596
and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.263
That's in order to delay --

00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:06.922
until Act Five, he can kill him.

00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:08.857
It's the same with the Chopin.

00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.293
He's just about to reach the E,

00:10:11.317 --> 00:10:13.920
and he says, "Oops, better
go back up and do it again."

00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:16.063
So he does it again.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.768
Now, he gets excited.

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:19.985
(Music)

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:21.976
That's excitement, don't worry about it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.831
Now, he gets to F-sharp,
and finally he goes down to E,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.136
but it's the wrong chord --

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.373
because the chord
he's looking for is this one,

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:31.969
and instead he does ...

00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:35.152
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.388
because it deceives us.

00:10:36.412 --> 00:10:38.903
I tell my students,
"If you have a deceptive cadence,

00:10:38.927 --> 00:10:41.146
raise your eyebrows,
and everybody will know."

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.078
(Laughter)

00:10:43.102 --> 00:10:46.783
(Applause)

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:48.474
Right.

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:50.420
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.

00:10:50.444 --> 00:10:51.639
Now, he tries E again.

00:10:51.663 --> 00:10:53.125
That chord doesn't work.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:55.545
Now, he tries the E again.
That chord doesn't work.

00:10:55.569 --> 00:10:57.678
Now, he tries E again,
and that doesn't work.

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.274
And then finally ...

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:05.019
There was a gentleman
in the front row who went, "Mmm."

00:11:05.043 --> 00:11:06.293
(Laughter)

00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:09.673
It's the same gesture
he makes when he comes home

00:11:09.697 --> 00:11:12.383
after a long day, turns off
the key in his car and says,

00:11:12.407 --> 00:11:13.659
"Aah, I'm home."

00:11:13.683 --> 00:11:15.309
Because we all know where home is.

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:18.573
So this is a piece which goes
from away to home.

00:11:18.597 --> 00:11:21.796
I'm going to play it all the way through
and you're going to follow.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.444
B, C, B, C, B, C, B --

00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:25.160
down to A, down to G, down to F.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.772
Almost goes to E, but otherwise
the play would be over.

00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:29.811
He goes back up to B,
he gets very excited.

00:11:29.835 --> 00:11:31.299
Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:33.377
It's the wrong chord.
It's the wrong chord.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.742
And finally goes to E, and it's home.

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:39.202
And what you're going to see
is one-buttock playing.

00:11:39.226 --> 00:11:40.976
(Laughter)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.176
Because for me, to join the B to the E,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.119
I have to stop thinking
about every single note along the way,

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:54.897
and start thinking about the long,
long line from B to E.

00:11:55.508 --> 00:12:00.012
You know, we were just in South Africa,
and you can't go to South Africa

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.632
without thinking of Mandela
in jail for 27 years.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:05.148
What was he thinking about? Lunch?

00:12:05.538 --> 00:12:08.976
No, he was thinking
about the vision for South Africa

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.545
and for human beings.

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:13.522
This is about vision.
This is about the long line.

00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:15.807
Like the bird who flies over the field

00:12:15.831 --> 00:12:19.573
and doesn't care about the fences
underneath, all right?

00:12:19.597 --> 00:12:22.692
So now, you're going to follow
the line all the way from B to E.

00:12:22.716 --> 00:12:26.065
And I've one last request before I play
this piece all the way through.

00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:30.447
Would you think of somebody who you adore,

00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:31.847
who's no longer there?

00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:34.876
A beloved grandmother, a lover --

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.023
somebody in your life
who you love with all your heart,

00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:41.116
but that person is no longer with you.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.224
Bring that person into your mind,

00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:46.225
and at the same time,

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:49.707
follow the line all the way from B to E,

00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:52.789
and you'll hear everything
that Chopin had to say.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.360
(Music)

00:14:45.079 --> 00:14:46.561
(Music ends)

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
(Applause)

00:14:56.522 --> 00:14:58.516
Now, you may be wondering --

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.540
(Applause)

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.820
(Applause ends)

00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:06.733
You may be wondering why I'm clapping.

00:15:06.757 --> 00:15:08.671
Well, I did this at a school in Boston

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:11.892
with about 70 seventh
graders, 12-year-olds.

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:14.253
I did exactly what I did with you,

00:15:14.277 --> 00:15:16.134
and I explained the whole thing.

00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:17.976
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.786
I was clapping. They were clapping.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.668
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"

00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:24.026
And one of them said,
"Because we were listening."

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.976
(Laughter)

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.194
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,

00:15:31.218 --> 00:15:33.558
involved in all sorts of different things,

00:15:33.582 --> 00:15:37.407
listening, understanding and being moved

00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:38.748
by a piece by Chopin.

00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:40.757
Now, that is something.

00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:43.488
Am I sure that every single
person followed that,

00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:45.107
understood it, was moved by it?

00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:46.432
Of course, I can't be sure.

00:15:46.456 --> 00:15:48.717
But I'll tell you what happened
to me in Ireland

00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:50.392
during the Troubles, 10 years ago,

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.341
and I was working with some Catholic
and Protestant kids

00:15:53.365 --> 00:15:55.796
on conflict resolution.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.502
And I did this with them --

00:15:57.526 --> 00:16:00.009
a risky thing to do,
because they were street kids.

00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:03.465
And one of them came to me
the next morning

00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:04.690
and he said,

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.587
"You know, I've never listened
to classical music in my life,

00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.720
but when you played
that shopping piece ..."

00:16:09.744 --> 00:16:11.514
(Laughter)

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:15.000
He said, "My brother was shot last year
and I didn't cry for him.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:17.783
But last night,
when you played that piece,

00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:19.621
he was the one I was thinking about.

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:22.580
And I felt the tears
streaming down my face.

00:16:22.604 --> 00:16:25.133
And it felt really
good to cry for my brother."

00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.182
So I made up my mind at that moment

00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:32.063
that classical music is for everybody.

00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:34.079
Everybody.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.497
Now, how would you walk --

00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:41.330
my profession, the music profession
doesn't see it that way.

00:16:41.774 --> 00:16:44.989
They say three percent of the population
likes classical music.

00:16:45.013 --> 00:16:48.267
If only we could move it to four percent,
our problems would be over.

00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:49.330
(Laughter)

00:16:49.354 --> 00:16:52.980
How would you walk?
How would you talk? How would you be?

00:16:53.004 --> 00:16:56.339
If you thought, "Three percent
of the population likes classical music,

00:16:56.363 --> 00:16:58.363
if only we could move it to four percent."

00:16:58.387 --> 00:17:00.504
How would you walk or talk?
How would you be?

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:02.963
If you thought, "Everybody
loves classical music --

00:17:02.987 --> 00:17:04.998
they just haven't found out about it yet."

00:17:05.403 --> 00:17:07.990
See, these are totally different worlds.

00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:10.662
Now, I had an amazing experience.

00:17:10.686 --> 00:17:11.928
I was 45 years old,

00:17:11.952 --> 00:17:13.735
I'd been conducting for 20 years,

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:15.959
and I suddenly had a realization.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.613
The conductor of an orchestra
doesn't make a sound.

00:17:20.478 --> 00:17:22.835
My picture appears
on the front of the CD --

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.761
(Laughter)

00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.786
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.633
He depends, for his power,

00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:32.509
on his ability to make
other people powerful.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.389
And that changed everything for me.

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:37.146
It was totally life-changing.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.683
People in my orchestra said,

00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:40.939
"Ben, what happened?"
That's what happened.

00:17:40.963 --> 00:17:45.663
I realized my job was to awaken
possibility in other people.

00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:49.402
And of course, I wanted to know
whether I was doing that.

00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:50.615
How do you find out?

00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:51.950
You look at their eyes.

00:17:51.974 --> 00:17:54.926
If their eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.

00:17:55.873 --> 00:17:58.236
You could light up a village
with this guy's eyes.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.276
(Laughter)

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.549
Right. So if the eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:05.261
If the eyes are not shining,
you get to ask a question.

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:06.691
And this is the question:

00:18:06.715 --> 00:18:09.279
who am I being

00:18:09.303 --> 00:18:11.572
that my players' eyes are not shining?

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:13.453
We can do that with our children, too.

00:18:13.477 --> 00:18:16.349
Who am I being,

00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:18.539
that my children's eyes are not shining?

00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:21.451
That's a totally different world.

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:26.540
Now, we're all about to end
this magical, on-the-mountain week,

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.300
we're going back into the world.

00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:32.580
And I say, it's appropriate
for us to ask the question,

00:18:32.604 --> 00:18:36.877
who are we being as we go back
out into the world?

00:18:37.571 --> 00:18:39.921
And you know, I have
a definition of success.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:41.181
For me, it's very simple.

00:18:41.205 --> 00:18:43.211
It's not about wealth and fame and power.

00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:45.664
It's about how many shining eyes
I have around me.

00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:48.574
So now, I have one last thought,

00:18:48.598 --> 00:18:52.930
which is that it really makes
a difference what we say --

00:18:52.954 --> 00:18:54.747
the words that come out of our mouth.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:58.281
I learned this from a woman
who survived Auschwitz,

00:18:58.305 --> 00:18:59.773
one of the rare survivors.

00:18:59.797 --> 00:19:02.694
She went to Auschwitz
when she was 15 years old.

00:19:04.003 --> 00:19:05.153
And ...

00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.007
And her brother was eight,

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:10.764
and the parents were lost.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:16.152
And she told me this, she said,

00:19:16.176 --> 00:19:18.628
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,

00:19:18.652 --> 00:19:21.525
and I looked down and saw
my brother's shoes were missing.

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:25.405
I said, 'Why are you so stupid,
can't you keep your things together

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:26.647
for goodness' sake?'"

00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:29.338
The way an elder sister might speak
to a younger brother.

00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:34.000
Unfortunately, it was the last
thing she ever said to him,

00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:35.548
because she never saw him again.

00:19:35.572 --> 00:19:36.839
He did not survive.

00:19:37.372 --> 00:19:39.897
And so when she came out
of Auschwitz, she made a vow.

00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:41.458
She told me this.

00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:44.902
She said, "I walked out
of Auschwitz into life

00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:46.309
and I made a vow.

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.933
And the vow was,

00:19:47.957 --> 00:19:53.095
"I will never say anything that couldn't
stand as the last thing I ever say."

00:19:54.573 --> 00:19:56.170
Now, can we do that? No.

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:59.050
And we'll make ourselves wrong
and others wrong.

00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:02.594
But it is a possibility to live into.

00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:04.911
Thank you.

00:20:04.935 --> 00:20:07.935
(Applause)

00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:12.895
Shining eyes.

00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:14.336
(Applause)

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.736
Shining eyes.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.760
(Applause)

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.468
Thank you, thank you.
