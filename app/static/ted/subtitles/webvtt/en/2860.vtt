00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.576
So I want to start this talk
by showing y'all a photo,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
and it's a photo many of you
have probably seen before.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.816
So I want you all to take a moment

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.536
and look at this photo,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.015
and really reflect on some
of the things that come to mind,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.240
and what are some
of those things, those words.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.040
Now, I'm going to ask you all
to look at me.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.320
What words come to mind
when you look at me?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.296
What separates that man up there

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.520
from me?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.736
The man in that photo is named David Kirby

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.256
and it was taken in 1990
as he was dying from AIDS-related illness,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.920
and it was subsequently
published in "Life Magazine."

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.696
The only real thing
separating me from Kirby

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.360
is about 30 years of medical advancements
in the way that we treat HIV and AIDS.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.040
So what I want to ask next is this:

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.856
If we have made such exponential progress

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.616
in combatting HIV,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.760
why haven't our perceptions
of those with the virus evolved alongside?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.960
Why does HIV elicit this reaction from us
when it's so easily managed?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.176
When did the stigmatization even occur,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.320
and why hasn't it subsided?

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.976
And these are not
easy questions to answer.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.736
They're the congealing
of so many different factors and ideas.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.016
Powerful images, like this one of Kirby,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.656
these were the faces of the AIDS crisis
in the '80s and '90s,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.816
and at the time the crisis
had a very obvious impact

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.936
on an already stigmatized group of people,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.440
and that was gay men.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.016
So what the general straight public saw
was this very awful thing

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.280
happening to a group of people who
were already on the fringes of society.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.496
The media at the time began
to use the two almost interchangeably --

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.176
gay and AIDS --

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.296
and at the 1984
Republican National Convention,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.680
one of the speakers joked
that gay stood for: "Got AIDS yet?"

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.720
And that was the mindset at the time.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.976
But as we started
to understand the virus more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.616
and how it was transmitted,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.720
we realized that that risk
had increased its territory.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.056
The highly profiled case
of Ryan White in 1985,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.016
who was a 13-year-old hemophiliac

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.936
who had contracted HIV
from a contaminated blood treatment,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.720
and this marked the most profound shift
in America's perception of HIV.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.096
No longer was it restricted
to these dark corners of society,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.056
to queers and drug users,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.576
but now it was affecting people

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.816
that society deemed
worthy of their empathy,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.136
to children.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.536
But that permeating fear
and that perception, it still lingers.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.776
And I want a show of hands
for these next few questions.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.536
How many of you in here
were aware that with treatment,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.896
those with HIV not only
fend off AIDS completely,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.000
but they live full and normal lives?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.576
Y'all are educated.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.776
(Laughter)

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.096
How many of you are aware
that with treatment,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.816
those with HIV can reach
an undetectable status,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.360
and that makes them
virtually uninfectious?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440
Much less.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.056
How many of you were aware
of the pre- and postexposure treatments

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.696
that are available
that reduce the risk of transmission

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.160
by over 90 percent?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.936
See, these are incredible advancements
that we have made in fighting HIV,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.616
yet they have not managed
to dent the perception

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
that most Americans have
of the virus and those living with it.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.416
And I don't want you to think
I'm downplaying the danger of this virus,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.880
and I am not ignorant of
the harrowing past of the AIDS epidemic.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.576
I am trying to convey
that there is hope for those infected

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.840
and HIV is not the death sentence
it was in the '80s.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.576
And now you may ask, and I asked
this question myself initially:

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.376
Where are the stories?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.216
Where are these people living with HIV?
Why haven't they been vocal?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.376
How can I believe these successes,
or these statistics,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.600
without seeing the successes?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.720
And this is actually
a very easy question for me to answer.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.976
Fear, stigma and shame:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.760
these keep those living with HIV
in the closet, so to speak.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.096
Our sexual histories are as personal
to us as our medical histories,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.536
and when you overlap the two,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.120
you can find yourself
in a very sensitive space.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.296
The fear of how others
perceive us when we're honest

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.096
keeps us from doing many things in life,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.800
and this is the case
for the HIV-positive population.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.136
To face social scrutiny and ridicule
is the price that we pay for transparency,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.616
and why become a martyr

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.056
when you can effectively pass
as someone without HIV?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.736
After all, there are no
physical indications you have the virus.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.360
There's no sign that you wear.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.656
There is safety in assimilation,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.840
and there is safety in invisibility.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.600
I'm here to throw back that veil
and share my story.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.016
So in the fall of 2014,
I was a sophomore in college

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.696
and like most college students,
I was sexually active,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.136
and I generally took precautions
to minimize the risk that sex carries.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.600
Now, I say generally,
because I wasn't always safe.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.336
It only takes a single misstep
before we're flat on the ground,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.176
and my misstep is pretty obvious.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.440
I had unprotected sex,
and I didn't think much of it.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.816
Fast-forward about three weeks,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.256
and it felt like I'd been trampled
by a herd of wildebeest.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.400
The aches in my body were
like nothing I have felt before or since.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.696
I would get these bouts
of fever and chill.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.640
I would reel with nausea,
and it was difficult to walk.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.616
Being a biology student,
I had some prior exposure to disease,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.056
and being a fairly informed gay man,
I had read a bit on HIV,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.536
so to me, it clicked
that this was seroconversion,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.576
or as it's sometimes called,
acute HIV infection.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.096
And this is the body's reaction

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.000
in producing antibodies
to the HIV antigen.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.656
It's important to note that not everybody
goes through this phase of sickness,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.760
but I was one of the lucky ones who did.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.696
And I was lucky as in,
there were these physical symptoms

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.616
that let me know, hey, something is wrong,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.440
and it let me detect
the virus pretty early.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.416
So just to clarify,
just to hit the nail on head,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.000
I got tested on campus.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.696
And they said they would call me
the next morning with the results,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.136
and they called me,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.416
but they asked me to come in
and speak to the doctor on staff.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.720
And the reaction I received from her
wasn't what I was expecting.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.536
She reassured me what I already knew,
that this wasn't a death sentence,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.376
and she even offered
to put me in contact with her brother,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.760
who had been living with HIV
since the early '90s.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.336
I declined her offer,
but I was deeply touched.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.376
I was expecting to be reprimanded.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.976
I was expecting pity and disappointment,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.776
and I was shown compassion
and human warmth,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.360
and I'm forever grateful
for that first exchange.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.416
So obviously for a few weeks,
I was a physical mess.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.656
Emotionally, mentally, I was doing OK.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.000
I was taking it well.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.536
But my body was ravaged,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.000
and those close to me,
they weren't oblivious.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.896
So I sat my roommates down,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.816
and I let them know
I'd been diagnosed with HIV,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.560
that I was about to receive treatment,
and I didn't want them to worry.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.560
And I remember the look on their faces.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.176
They were holding each other
on the couch and they were crying,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.776
and I consoled them.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.536
I consoled them about my own bad news,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.560
but it was heartwarming
to see that they cared.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.816
But from that night, I noticed a shift

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.680
in the way that I was treated at home.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.376
My roommates wouldn't
touch anything of mine,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.760
and they wouldn't eat
anything I had cooked.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.176
Now, in South Louisiana,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.416
we all know that you don't refuse food.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.496
(Laughter)

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.616
And I'm a damn good cook,
so don't think that passed me by.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.056
(Laughter)

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.216
But from these first silent hints,
their aversion got gradually more obvious

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.480
and more offensive.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.216
I was asked to move my toothbrush
from the bathroom,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.616
I was asked to not share towels,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.760
and I was even asked
to wash my clothes on a hotter setting.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.296
This wasn't head lice, y'all.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.775
This wasn't scabies. This was HIV.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.176
It can be transmitted through blood,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.976
sexual fluids like semen or vaginal fluids

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.296
and breast milk.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.176
Since I wasn't sleeping with my roommates,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.016
I wasn't breastfeeding them --

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.256
(Laughter)

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.376
and we weren't reenacting "Twilight,"

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.656
I was of no risk to them

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.136
and I made this aware to them,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.936
but still, this discomfort, it continued,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.200
until eventually I was asked to move out.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.216
And I was asked to move out

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.856
because one of my roommates
had shared my status with her parents.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.360
She shared my personal
medical information to strangers.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.576
And now I'm doing that
in a roomful of 300 of y'all,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.056
but at the time, this was not
something I was comfortable with,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.720
and they expressed their discomfort
with their daughter living with me.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.736
So being gay, raised
in a religious household

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.136
and living in the South,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.920
discrimination wasn't new to me.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.176
But this form was,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.016
and it was tremendously disappointing

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.040
because it came
from such an unlikely source.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.576
Not only were these
college-educated people,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.376
not only were they other members
of the LGBT community,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.240
but they were also my friends.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.856
So I did. I moved out
at the end of the semester.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.776
But it wasn't to appease them.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.600
It was out of respect for myself.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.736
I wasn't going to subject myself to people

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.936
who were unwilling
to remedy their ignorance,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.856
and I wasn't going to let something
that was now a part of me

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.760
ever be used as a tool against me.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.976
So I opted for transparency
about my status,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.960
always being visible.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.976
And this is what I like to call
being the everyday advocate.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.296
The point of this transparency,
the point of this everyday advocacy,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.416
was to dispel ignorance,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.416
and ignorance is a very scary word.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.896
We don't want to be seen as ignorant,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.496
and we definitely
don't want to be called it.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.536
But ignorance is not
synonymous with stupid.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.936
It's not the inability to learn.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.096
It's the state you're in before you learn.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.456
So when I saw someone
coming from a place of ignorance,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.696
I saw an opportunity for them to learn.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.856
And hopefully, if I could
spread some education,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.096
then I could mitigate
situations for others

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.176
like I had experienced with my roommates

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.320
and save someone else
down the line that humiliation.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.880
So the reactions I received
haven't been all positive.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.016
Here in the South,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.416
we have a lot stigma
due to religious pressures,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.336
our lack of a comprehensive sex education

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.936
and our general conservative outlook
on anything sexual.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.920
We view this as a gay disease.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.016
Globally, most new HIV infections
occur between heterosexual partners,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.896
and here in the States,
women, especially women of color,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.200
are at an increased risk.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.896
This is not a gay disease.
It never has been.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.120
It's a disease we should
all be concerned with.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.576
So initially, I felt limited.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.680
I wanted to expand my scope
and reach beyond what was around me.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.056
So naturally,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.896
I turned to the dark underworld
of online dating apps,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.096
to apps like Grindr,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.056
and for those of you who are unfamiliar,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.376
these are dating apps
targeted towards gay men.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.256
You can upload a profile and a picture

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.976
and it will show you
available guys within a radius.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.296
Y'all have probably heard of Tinder.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.256
Grindr has been around for a lot longer,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.376
since it was much harder
to meet your future gay husband

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.536
at church or the grocery store,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.416
or whatever straight people did

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.016
before they found out
they could date on their phones.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.176
(Laughter)

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.296
So on Grindr, if you liked
what you saw or read,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.376
you could send someone a message,
you can meet up, you can do other things.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.776
So on my profile,
I obviously stated that I had HIV,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.096
I was undetectable, and I welcomed
questions about my status.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.136
And I received a lot of questions

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.680
and a lot of comments,
both positive and negative.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.016
And I want to start with the negative,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.080
just to frame some of this ignorance
that I've mentioned before.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.536
And most of these negative comments
were passing remarks or assumptions.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.096
They would assume things
about my sex life or my sex habits.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.600
They would assume
I put myself or others at risk.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.120
But very often I would just be met
with these passing ignorant remarks.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.696
In the gay community,
it's common to hear the word "clean"

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.536
when you're referring to someone
who is HIV negative.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.136
Of course the flip side to that
is being unclean, or dirty,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.816
when you do have HIV.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.296
Now, I'm not sensitive

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.160
and I'm only truly dirty
after a day in the field,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.056
but this is damaging language.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.496
This is a community-driven stigma

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.776
that keeps many gay men
from disclosing their status,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.456
and it keeps those newly diagnosed

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.776
from seeking support
within their own community,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.840
and I find that truly distressing.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.416
But thankfully, the positive responses
have been a lot more numerous,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.576
and they came from guys who were curious.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.616
And they were curious
about the risks of transmission,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.256
or what exactly "undetectable" meant,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.016
or where they could get tested,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.256
or some guys would ask me
about my experiences,

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.080
and I could share my story with them.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.136
But most importantly,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.376
I would get approached by guys
who were newly diagnosed with HIV

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.616
and they were scared, and they were alone,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.160
and they didn't know
what step to take next.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.616
They didn't want to tell their family,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.496
they didn't want to tell their friends

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.080
and they felt damaged,
and they felt dirty.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.576
And I did whatever I could
to immediately calm them,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.416
and then I would put them in contact
with AcadianaCares,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.656
which is a wonderful resource
we have in our community

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.040
for those with HIV.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.376
And I'd put them in contact
with people I knew personally

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.856
so that they could not only
have this safe space to feel human again,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.376
but so they could also have
the resources they needed

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.056
in affording their treatment.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.416
And this was by far
the most humbling aspect

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.416
of my transparency,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.856
that I could have some positive impact
on those who were suffering like I did,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.456
that I could help those
who were in the dark,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.400
because I had been there,
and it wasn't a good place to be.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.576
These guys came from
all different backgrounds,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.296
and many of them
weren't as informed as I had been,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.560
and they were coming to me
from a place of fear.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.696
Some of these people I knew personally,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.256
or they knew of me,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.616
but many more, they were anonymous.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.216
They were these blank profiles
who were too afraid to show their faces

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.600
after what they had told me.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.176
And on the topic of transparency,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.240
I want to leave y'all with a few thoughts.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.216
I found that with whatever risk
or gamble I took

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.216
in putting my face out there,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.456
it was well worth any negative comment,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.840
any flak I received,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.440
because I felt I was able to make
this real and this tangible impact.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.536
And it showed me that our efforts resound,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.336
that we can alter the lives
that we encounter for the good,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.440
and they in turn can take that momentum
and push it even further.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.256
And if any of you or anyone you know
is dealing with HIV,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.336
or if you want to see what resources
you have in your community,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.920
or just educate yourself
more on the disease,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.896
here are some wonderful national sites
that you can access

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.576
and you are more than welcome
to find me after this talk

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.240
and ask me anything you'd like.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.160
We've all heard the phrase
"to see the forest through the trees,"

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.280
so I implore all of you here to really
see the human through the disease.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.056
It's a very easy thing
to see numbers and statistics

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.640
and only see the perceived dangers.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.080
It's a much harder thing to see
all the faces behind those numbers.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.416
So when you find yourself
thinking those things, those words,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.840
what you might have thought
looking at David Kirby,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.296
I ask you instead,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.520
think son,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.520
or think brother,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.640
think friend

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.600
and most importantly, think human.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.816
Seek education when faced with ignorance,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.736
and always be mindful,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.000
and always be compassionate.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.776
Thank you.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.560
(Applause)
