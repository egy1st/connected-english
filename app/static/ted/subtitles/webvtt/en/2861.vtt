00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:02.183
I used to think

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:05.941
the whole purpose of life
was pursuing happiness.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.064
Everyone said the path
to happiness was success,

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:12.586
so I searched for that ideal job,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.641
that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment.

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:19.996
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.624
I felt anxious and adrift.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.204
And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.989
Eventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:36.233
to learn what truly makes people happy.

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:39.627
But what I discovered there
changed my life.

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:45.062
The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.224
And what really struck me was this:

00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:51.845
the suicide rate has been rising
around the world,

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.960
and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America.

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:58.516
Even though life is getting
objectively better

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.230
by nearly every conceivable standard,

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:03.453
more people feel hopeless,

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.602
depressed and alone.

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:09.027
There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people,

00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.321
and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it.

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:15.245
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.016
Is this all there is?

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.373
And according to the research,
what predicts this despair

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:24.224
is not a lack of happiness.

00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:26.090
It's a lack of something else,

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.755
a lack of having meaning in life.

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:33.355
But that raised some questions for me.

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.454
Is there more to life than being happy?

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:39.639
And what's the difference
between being happy

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:41.554
and having meaning in life?

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:47.479
Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease,

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:49.392
feeling good in the moment.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.756
Meaning, though, is deeper.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.842
The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:59.513
meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.220
and from developing the best within you.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:06.212
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:10.343
but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.296
And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.730
they're more resilient,

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:17.311
they do better in school and at work,

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:18.942
and they even live longer.

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.006
So this all made me wonder:

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.504
How can we each live more meaningfully?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.658
To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.583
and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology,

00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:34.708
neuroscience and philosophy.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:37.155
Bringing it all together,

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:42.520
I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life.

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:44.978
And we can each create lives of meaning

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:48.351
by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives.

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:51.616
The first pillar is belonging.

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:54.685
Belonging comes
from being in relationships

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.414
where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically

00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.551
and where you value others as well.

00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:04.908
But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging;

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:06.825
you're valued for what you believe,

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.095
for who you hate,

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.664
not for who you are.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.203
True belonging springs from love.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.212
It lives in moments among individuals,

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:20.081
and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:22.268
Here's an example.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:25.847
Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.089
from the same street vendor in New York.

00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:30.782
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:33.489
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.419
and treat each other like humans.

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:39.432
But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change,

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:40.676
and the vendor said,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.220
"Don't worry about it."

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.731
But Jonathan insisted on paying,

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.767
so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.252
to make change.

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:52.615
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.161
the vendor drew back.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.098
He was hurt.

00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:58.564
He was trying to do something kind,

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:00.835
but Jonathan had rejected him.

00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:06.264
I think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it.

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.486
I do.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.573
I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them.

00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:13.244
I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me.

00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.607
These acts devalue others.

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.384
They make them feel
invisible and unworthy.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.882
But when you lead with love,
you create a bond

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:23.578
that lifts each of you up.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.658
For many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning,

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:30.680
those bonds to family and friends.

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:35.181
For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose.

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:38.759
Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.031
as finding that job that makes you happy.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.979
Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give.

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:49.491
A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:51.226
Many parents tell me,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.186
"My purpose is raising my children."

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:57.571
The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.889
Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work.

00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:04.892
That's how we contribute and feel needed.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:08.776
But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.213
unemployment,

00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:12.464
low labor force participation --

00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:16.179
these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too.

00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:19.034
Without something worthwhile to do,

00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:20.359
people flounder.

00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:24.109
Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work,

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.862
but purpose gives you
something to live for,

00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:28.966
some "why" that drives you forward.

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:34.447
The third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself,

00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:36.313
but in a completely different way:

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:37.924
transcendence.

00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:40.325
Transcendent states are those rare moments

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.761
when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life,

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:45.490
your sense of self fades away,

00:05:45.514 --> 00:05:48.288
and you feel connected
to a higher reality.

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:52.904
For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art.

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:55.458
For another person, it was at church.

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:59.036
For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.130
Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:07.903
These transcendent
experiences can change you.

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:12.451
One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:13.676
for one minute.

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:16.417
But afterwards
they felt less self-centered,

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:18.385
and they even behaved more generously

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.479
when given the chance to help someone.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:25.302
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.

00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:29.097
Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found,

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.876
tends to surprise people.

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:34.100
The fourth pillar is storytelling,

00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:36.989
the story you tell yourself
about yourself.

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:41.760
Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity.

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:44.820
It helps you understand
how you became you.

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.765
But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.952
and can change the way we're telling them.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.467
Your life isn't just a list of events.

00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:56.707
You can edit, interpret
and retell your story,

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:58.951
even as you're constrained by the facts.

00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:04.309
I met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.379
After his injury, Emeka told himself,

00:07:07.403 --> 00:07:10.108
"My life was great playing football,

00:07:10.132 --> 00:07:12.256
but now look at me."

00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:16.294
People who tell stories like this --

00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:18.842
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:21.688
tend to be more anxious and depressed.

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:24.041
And that was Emeka for a while.

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:27.964
But with time, he started
to weave a different story.

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.148
His new story was,

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:33.439
"Before my injury,
my life was purposeless.

00:07:33.463 --> 00:07:36.716
I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.448
But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:45.029
That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life.

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:47.484
After telling the new story to himself,

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.430
Emeka started mentoring kids,

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:51.820
and he discovered what his purpose was:

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:53.234
serving others.

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.479
The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a "redemptive story,"

00:07:57.503 --> 00:07:59.786
where the bad is redeemed by the good.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:02.810
People leading meaningful
lives, he's found,

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.765
tend to tell stories about their lives

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:07.811
defined by redemption, growth and love.

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:11.185
But what makes people
change their stories?

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.653
Some people get help from a therapist,

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:15.487
but you can do it on your own, too,

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.271
just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully,

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:20.382
how your defining experiences shaped you,

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:22.143
what you lost, what you gained.

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.123
That's what Emeka did.

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.058
You won't change your story overnight;

00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:29.427
it could take years and be painful.

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:32.385
After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle.

00:08:32.957 --> 00:08:37.296
But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.385
to finding that good that sustains you.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:47.117
Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling:

00:08:47.863 --> 00:08:50.594
those are the four pillars of meaning.

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:53.232
When I was younger,

00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:56.894
I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars.

00:08:57.381 --> 00:09:01.921
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal.

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:07.169
Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:08.586
and the poet Rumi.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.005
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:15.789
to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories.

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:19.166
Their practice also involved
serving all of creation

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.000
through small acts of love,

00:09:21.024 --> 00:09:24.365
which meant being kind
even when people wronged you.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:27.543
But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego.

00:09:28.912 --> 00:09:31.528
Eventually, I left home for college

00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:35.254
and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life,

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:36.866
I felt unmoored.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.478
And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living.

00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:42.615
That's what set me on this journey.

00:09:43.012 --> 00:09:44.769
Looking back, I now realize

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:48.035
that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning.

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:50.565
The pillars were part of the architecture,

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.815
and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply.

00:09:54.414 --> 00:09:56.735
Of course, the same principle applies

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.960
in other strong communities as well --

00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:01.006
good ones and bad ones.

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.585
Gangs, cults:

00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:06.622
these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars

00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:10.024
and give people
something to live and die for.

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:12.915
But that's exactly why we as a society

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:15.048
must offer better alternatives.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:18.823
We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:21.429
to help people become their best selves.

00:10:22.524 --> 00:10:25.110
But living a meaningful life takes work.

00:10:25.134 --> 00:10:27.009
It's an ongoing process.

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:30.762
As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives,

00:10:30.786 --> 00:10:32.355
adding to our story.

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:35.580
And sometimes we can get off track.

00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:38.273
Whenever that happens to me,

00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:41.686
I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.468
Several months after
I graduated from college,

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:50.350
my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:54.247
He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.893
as he faced death,

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.600
he said all he could think about
was needing to live

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.762
so he could be there
for my brother and me,

00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:03.375
and this gave him the will
to fight for life.

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:07.361
When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery,

00:11:07.385 --> 00:11:09.715
instead of counting backwards from 10,

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:12.909
he repeated our names like a mantra.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.601
He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:18.850
if he died.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:24.645
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.732
It's a humble life,

00:11:26.756 --> 00:11:28.025
but a good life.

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:32.476
Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live:

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.908
love.

00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:36.383
His sense of belonging within his family,

00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:38.136
his purpose as a dad,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.174
his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names --

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:43.979
these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived.

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:46.442
That's the story he tells himself.

00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.897
That's the power of meaning.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:53.435
Happiness comes and goes.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.308
But when life is really good

00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:57.221
and when things are really bad,

00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:00.294
having meaning gives you
something to hold on to.

00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:01.546
Thank you.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.152
