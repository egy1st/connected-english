WEBVTT

00:00:01.786 --> 00:00:03.485
As you heard, I'm a physicist.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.494
And I think the way we talk about physics
needs a little modification.

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:10.879
I am from just down the road here;
I don't live here anymore.

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:15.410
But coming from round here means
that I have a northern nana,

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:16.601
my mum's mom.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.652
And Nana is very bright;
she hasn't had much formal education,

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:21.844
but she's sharp.

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:25.946
And when I was a second-year undergraduate
studying physics at Cambridge,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.813
I remember spending an afternoon
at Nana's house in Urmston

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:32.219
studying quantum mechanics.

00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:34.534
And I had these folders
open in front of me

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.456
with this, you know,
hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.184
And Nana came along,
and she looked at this folder,

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.799
and she said, "What's that?"

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:47.179
I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:52.009
And I tried to explain something
about what was on the page.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:56.022
It was to do with the nucleus
and Einstein A and B coefficients.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:57.836
And Nana looked very impressed.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:00:59.903
And then she said, "Oh.

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:03.053
What can you do when you know that?"

00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:05.077
(Laughter)

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:08.724
"Don't know, ma'am."

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:09.812
(Laughter)

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.836
I think I said something about computers,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.938
because it was all
I could think of at the time.

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:18.606
But you can broaden that question out,
because it's a very good question --

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.532
"What can you do when you know that?"
when "that" is physics?

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:25.024
And I've come to realize that when
we talk about physics in society

00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:26.450
and our sort of image of it,

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:29.626
we don't include the things
that we can do when we know that.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.363
Our perception of what physics is
needs a bit of a shift.

00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:34.291
Not only does it need a bit of a shift,

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:39.871
but sharing this different perspective
matters for our society,

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.103
and I'm not just saying that
because I'm a physicist and I'm biased

00:01:43.127 --> 00:01:45.894
and I think we're the most
important people in the world.

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:47.069
Honest.

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:50.735
So, the image of physics -- we've got
an image problem, let's be honest --

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.573
it hasn't moved on much from this.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:56.729
This is a very famous photograph
that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.

00:01:56.753 --> 00:02:00.998
This is when the great minds
of physics were grappling

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.268
with the nature of determinism

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.372
and what it means
only to have a probability

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.107
that a particle might be somewhere,

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:08.713
and whether any of it was real.

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.204
And it was all very difficult.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:13.191
And you'll notice they're all
very stern-looking men in suits.

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:16.125
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying,
"Marie Antoinette,"

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.113
which would be a turn-up for the books --

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.733
Marie Curie, third from the left
on the bottom there,

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:23.472
she was allowed in,
but had to dress like everybody else.

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:24.521
(Laughter)

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:28.435
So, this is what physics is like --
there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.632
these are to do with waves and particles.

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:33.836
That is an artist's impression
of two black holes colliding,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.148
which makes it look
worth watching, to be honest.

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.564
I'm glad I didn't have to write
the risk assessment

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:40.120
for whatever was going on there.

00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.497
The point is: this is
the image of physics, right?

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:43.720
It's weird and difficult,

00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:46.868
done by slightly strange people
dressed in a slightly strange way.

00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:48.893
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:50.727
and fundamentally, why should I care?

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.519
And the problem with that
is that I'm a physicist,

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:57.016
and I study this.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.326
This -- this is my job, right?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.050
I study the interface
between the atmosphere and the ocean.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:05.362
The atmosphere is massive,
the ocean is massive,

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.487
and the thin layer
that joins them together

00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:08.673
is really important,

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:11.914
because that's where things go
from one huge reservoir to the other.

00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:15.652
You can see that the sea surface --
that was me who took this video --

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.811
the average height of those waves
by the way, was 10 meters.

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:21.330
So this is definitely physics
happening here --

00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:23.902
there's lots of things --
this is definitely physics.

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:27.476
And yet it's not included
in our cultural perception of physics,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.326
and that bothers me.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.678
So what is included
in our cultural perception of physics?

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:35.512
Because I'm a physicist,
there has to be a graph, right?

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:36.692
That's allowed.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:40.977
We've got time along the bottom here,
from very fast things there,

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:44.442
to things that take a long time over here.

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:46.961
Small things at the bottom,
big things up there.

00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:50.010
So, our current cultural image
of physics looks like this.

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:52.555
There's quantum mechanics
down in that corner,

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.579
it's very small, it's very weird,

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:56.604
it happens very quickly,

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:59.909
and it's a long way down
in the general ...

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:02.767
on the scale of anything that matters
for everyday life.

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:05.123
And then there's cosmology,
which is up there;

00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:06.458
very large, very far away,

00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:08.482
also very weird.

00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:10.506
And if you go to some places

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.594
like black holes
in the beginning of the universe,

00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:16.620
we know that these are frontiers
in physics, right?

00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:19.399
There's lots of work being done
to discover new physics

00:04:19.423 --> 00:04:20.849
in these places.

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:24.834
But the thing is, you will notice
there's a very large gap in the middle.

00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:27.016
And in that gap, there are many things.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.683
There are planets and toasts
and volcanoes and clouds

00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:31.844
and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:35.127
and all sorts of things
that make up our everyday life.

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:38.264
And these are also run by physics,
you'd be surprised --

00:04:38.288 --> 00:04:41.587
there is physics in the middle,
it's just that nobody talks about it.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:45.582
And the thing about all of these
is that they all run

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:49.137
on a relatively small number
of physical laws,

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:51.039
things like Newton's laws of motion,

00:04:51.063 --> 00:04:52.226
thermodynamics,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.965
some rotational dynamics.

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:57.517
The physics in the middle
applies over a huge range,

00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:00.162
from very, very small things
to very, very big things.

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:02.560
You have to try very hard
to get outside of this.

00:05:02.584 --> 00:05:06.385
And there is also a frontier
in research physics here,

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.212
it's just that nobody talks about it.

00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:09.913
This is the world of the complex.

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:12.184
When these laws work together,
they bring about

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:15.038
the beautiful, messy,
complex world we live in.

00:05:15.062 --> 00:05:18.735
Fundamentally, this is the bit
that really matters to me

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.949
on an everyday basis.

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:22.152
And this is the bit
that we don't talk about.

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:24.510
There's plenty of physics
research going on here.

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:26.908
But because it doesn't involve
pointing at stars,

00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:29.014
people for some reason
think it's not that.

00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:32.520
Now, the cool thing about this
is that there are so many things

00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:34.544
in this middle bit,

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:37.402
all following the same physical laws,

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:39.751
that we can see those laws at work

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:41.775
almost all the time around us.

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.214
I've got a little video here.

00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:47.201
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw
and one of them has been boiled.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.225
I want you to tell me which one is which.

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:52.515
Which one's raw?

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:53.685
(Audience responds)

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:55.183
The one on the left -- yes!

00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:58.047
And even though you might not
have tried that, you all knew.

00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.621
The reason for that is,
you set them spinning,

00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:03.828
and when you stop the cooked egg,
the one that's completely solid,

00:06:03.852 --> 00:06:05.004
you stop the entire egg.

00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:07.591
When you stop the other one,
you only stop the shell;

00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:10.961
the liquid inside is still rotating
because nothing's made it stop.

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:15.267
And then it pushes the shell round again,
so the egg starts to rotate again.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.333
This is brilliant, right?

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:19.622
It's a demonstration
of something in physics

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:22.992
that we call the law of conservation
of angular momentum,

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.738
which basically says
that if you set something spinning

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:26.917
about a fixed axis,

00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:30.036
that it will keep spinning
unless you do something to stop it.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.240
And that's really fundamental
in how the universe works.

00:06:33.264 --> 00:06:35.864
And it's not just eggs that it applies to,

00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:38.700
although it's really useful
if you're the sort of person --

00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:40.667
and apparently, these people do exist --

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.478
who will boil eggs
and then put them back in the fridge.

00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:46.607
Who does that? Don't admit to it --
it's OK. We won't judge you.

00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:49.700
But it's also got much
broader applicabilities.

00:06:49.724 --> 00:06:51.696
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.912
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field,
which is a very tiny part of the sky.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:58.057
Hubble has been floating
in free space for 25 years,

00:06:58.081 --> 00:06:59.649
not touching anything.

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.379
And yet it can point
to a tiny region of sky.

00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:06.705
For 11 and a half days,
it did it in sections,

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.383
accurately enough
to take amazing images like this.

00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:10.566
So the question is:

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.004
How does something
that is not touching anything

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:14.189
know where it is?

00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:17.174
The answer is that right in the middle
of it, it has something

00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:19.569
that, to my great disappointment,
isn't a raw egg,

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:21.132
but basically does the same job.

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:23.035
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.863
and because of the law
of conservation of angular momentum,

00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:28.461
they keep spinning
with the same axis, indefinitely.

00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:31.574
Hubble kind of rotates around them,
and so it can orient itself.

00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:35.742
So the same little physical law
we can play with in the kitchen and use,

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:40.319
also explains what makes possible
some of the most advanced technology

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:42.094
of our time.

00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:45.725
So this is the fun bit of physics,
that you learn these patterns

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.310
and then you can apply them
again and again and again.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:51.210
And it's really rewarding
when you spot them in new places.

00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:52.727
This is the fun of physics.

00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:57.205
I have shown that egg video
to an audience full of businesspeople once

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.879
and they were all dressed up very smartly
and trying to impress their bosses.

00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:05.682
And I was running out of time,
so I showed the egg video and then said,

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:08.566
"Well, you can work it out,
and ask me afterwards to check."

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.747
Then I left the stage.

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:10.924
And I had, literally,

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.525
middle-aged grown men
tugging on my sleeve afterwards,

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:15.185
saying, "Is it this? Is it this?"

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:17.213
And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"

00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:18.257
(Laughter)

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.739
The joy that you get
from spotting these patterns

00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:22.880
doesn't go away when you're an adult.

00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:24.659
And that's really important,

00:08:24.683 --> 00:08:27.162
because physics is all about patterns,

00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:29.832
and a small number of patterns
give you access

00:08:29.856 --> 00:08:33.323
to almost all of the physics
in our everyday world.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:36.918
The thing that's best about this
is it involves playing with toys.

00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:40.433
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed
as the mundane little things

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:43.543
that we just give the kids to play with
on a Saturday afternoon

00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:44.732
to keep them quiet.

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:47.012
This is the stuff
that actually really matters,

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:50.060
because this is the laws of the universe
and it applies to eggs

00:08:50.084 --> 00:08:53.363
and toast falling butter-side down
and all sorts of other things,

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:55.821
just as much as it applies
to modern technology

00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:58.058
and anything else
that's going on in the world.

00:08:58.082 --> 00:09:01.796
So I think we should play
with these patterns.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.035
Basically, there are a small
number of concepts

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.064
that you can become familiar with
using things in your kitchen,

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.853
that are really useful
for life in the outside world.

00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:13.434
If you want to learn about thermodynamics,
a duck is a good place to start,

00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:15.510
for example, why their feet
don't get cold.

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:18.085
Once you've got a bit
of thermodynamics with the duck,

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:19.528
you can also explain fridges.

00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:22.313
Magnets that you can play with
in your kitchen

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:26.377
get you to wind turbines
and modern energy generation.

00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.445
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always
a good thing to play with.

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:32.748
If you're at a boring party,
fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.772
put them in some lemonade.

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:36.383
It's got three consequences.

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:38.774
First thing is, it's quite good
to watch; try it.

00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:41.313
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.

00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:43.700
Thirdly, it brings
the interesting people to you.

00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:45.087
You win on all fronts.

00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.458
And then there's spin
and gas laws and viscosity.

00:09:48.482 --> 00:09:51.974
There's these little patterns,
and they're right around us everywhere.

00:09:51.998 --> 00:09:55.559
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:59.235
Everybody has access to the same physics;
you don't need a big, posh lab.

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:03.213
When I wrote the book,
I had the chapter on spin.

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.919
I had written a bit
about toast falling butter-side down.

00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:09.015
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine
who's not a scientist,

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.153
for him to read and tell me
what he thought,

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:14.255
and he took the chapter away.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.488
He was working overseas.

00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:18.489
I got this text message back from him
a couple of weeks later,

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:22.722
and it said, "I'm at breakfast
in a posh hotel in Switzerland,

00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:25.478
and I really want
to push toast off the table,

00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:28.044
because I don't believe what you wrote."

00:10:28.068 --> 00:10:30.383
And that was the good bit --
he doesn't have to.

00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:33.863
He can push the toast off the table
and try it for himself.

00:10:33.887 --> 00:10:37.724
And so there's two important things
to know about science:

00:10:37.748 --> 00:10:42.062
the fundamental laws we've learned
through experience and experimentation,

00:10:42.086 --> 00:10:43.240
work.

00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:45.246
The day we drop an apple and it goes up,

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.186
then we'll have a debate about gravity.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.800
Up to that point,
we basically know how gravity works,

00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:51.358
and we can learn the framework.

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:53.669
Then there's the process
of experimentation:

00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:55.896
having confidence in things,
trying things out,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.389
critical thinking -- how we move
science forward --

00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:00.413
and you can learn both of those things

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:03.532
by playing with toys
in the everyday world.

00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:05.703
And it's really important,

00:11:05.727 --> 00:11:07.942
because there's all this talk
about technology,

00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:09.967
we've heard talks about quantum computing

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:11.992
and all these mysterious, far-off things.

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:15.850
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies
that are about this size,

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:18.811
we still walk about,
sit on chairs that are about this size,

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:20.835
we still live in the physical world.

00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:24.807
And being familiar with these concepts
means we're not helpless.

00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:27.682
And I think it's really important
that we're not helpless,

00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:29.914
that society feels it can look at things,

00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:32.604
because this isn't
about knowing all the answers.

00:11:32.628 --> 00:11:36.045
It's about having the framework
so you can ask the right questions.

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:39.583
And by playing with these fundamental
little things in everyday life,

00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:42.342
we gain the confidence
to ask the right questions.

00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:44.052
So, there's a bigger thing.

00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:45.450
In answer to Nana's question

00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:47.484
about what can you do
when you know that --

00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:49.961
because there's lots of stuff
in the everyday world

00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:51.682
that you can do when you know that,

00:11:51.706 --> 00:11:54.160
especially if you've got
eggs in the fridge --

00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:56.506
there's a much deeper answer.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.694
And so there's all the fun
and the curiosity

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.680
that you could have playing with toys.

00:12:00.704 --> 00:12:04.252
By the way -- why should kids have
all the fun, right?

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:06.276
All of us can have fun playing with toys,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.300
and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.

00:12:08.324 --> 00:12:10.202
You can blame me, it's fine.

00:12:10.226 --> 00:12:15.635
So when it comes to reasons
for studying physics, for example,

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:18.550
here is the best reason I can think of:

00:12:18.574 --> 00:12:22.406
I think that each of us has
three life-support systems.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.787
We've got our own body, we've got a planet

00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.578
and we've got our civilization.

00:12:26.602 --> 00:12:29.641
Each of those is an independent
life-support system,

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.665
keeping us alive in its own way.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:34.856
And they all run
on the fundamental physical laws

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.280
that you can learn in the kitchen
with eggs and teacups and lemonade,

00:12:38.304 --> 00:12:40.183
and everything else you can play with.

00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:41.808
This is the reason, for example,

00:12:41.832 --> 00:12:44.737
why something like climate change
is such a serious problem,

00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:47.293
because It's two of these
life-support systems,

00:12:47.317 --> 00:12:49.085
our planet and our civilization,

00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:51.064
kind of butting up against each other;

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:53.980
they're in conflict,
and we need to negotiate that boundary.

00:12:54.004 --> 00:12:56.520
And the fundamental physical laws
that we can learn

00:12:56.544 --> 00:12:58.724
that are the way
the world around us works,

00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:01.168
are the tools at the basis of everything;

00:13:01.192 --> 00:13:02.554
they're the foundation.

00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:04.749
There's lots of things
to know about in life,

00:13:04.773 --> 00:13:07.569
but knowing the foundations
is going to get you a long way.

00:13:07.593 --> 00:13:11.234
And I think this, if you're not interested
in having fun with physics

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:15.309
or anything like that -- strange,
but apparently, these people exist --

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:19.420
you surely are interested
in keeping yourself alive

00:13:19.444 --> 00:13:21.495
and in how our life-support systems work.

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:26.294
The framework for physics
is remarkably constant;

00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:28.994
it's the same in lots and lots
of things that we measure.

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:30.856
It's not going to change anytime soon.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.143
They might discover
some new quantum mechanics,

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:35.823
but apples right here
are still going to fall down.

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:37.970
So, the question is --

00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:40.283
I get asked sometimes: How do you start?

00:13:40.307 --> 00:13:41.528
What's the place to start

00:13:41.552 --> 00:13:44.808
if you're interested in the physical
world, in not being helpless,

00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:46.669
and in finding some toys to play with?

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.097
Here is my suggestion to you:

00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:54.520
the place to start is that moment --
and adults do this --

00:13:54.544 --> 00:13:56.406
you're drifting along somewhere,

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.021
and you spot something
and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."

00:14:00.045 --> 00:14:03.669
And then your consciousness goes,
"You're an adult. Keep going."

00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.532
And that's the point --
hold that thought --

00:14:06.556 --> 00:14:09.184
that bit where your brain went,
"Oh, that's a bit odd,"

00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:11.261
because there's something
there to play with,

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.003
and it's worth you playing with it,

00:14:13.027 --> 00:14:14.423
so that's the place to start.

00:14:14.447 --> 00:14:16.813
But if you don't have
any of those little moments

00:14:16.837 --> 00:14:18.433
on your way home from this event,

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.142
here are some things to start with.

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:22.328
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade;
highly entertaining.

00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:24.352
Watch a coffee spill dry.

00:14:24.376 --> 00:14:26.980
I know that sounds a little bit
like watching paint dry,

00:14:27.004 --> 00:14:30.469
but it does do quite weird things;
it's worth watching.

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:34.688
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties
if there are teacups around.

00:14:34.712 --> 00:14:38.152
There are so many things you can do
to play with teacups, it's brilliant.

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:41.585
The most obvious one
is to get a teacup, get a spoon,

00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:43.927
tap the teacup around the rim and listen,

00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:45.746
and you will hear something strange.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.070
And the other thing is,
push your toast off the table

00:14:49.094 --> 00:14:51.503
because you can,
and you'll learn stuff from it.

00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:53.479
And if you're feeling really ambitious,

00:14:53.503 --> 00:14:57.630
try and push it off in such a way
that it doesn't fall butter-side down,

00:14:57.654 --> 00:14:59.210
which is possible.

00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:01.936
The point of all of this is that,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.053
first of all, we should all
play with toys.

00:15:04.077 --> 00:15:07.501
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate
the physical world for ourselves

00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:08.775
with the tools around us,

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:10.579
because we all have access to them.

00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:13.222
It matters, because if we want
to understand society,

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.805
if we want to be good citizens,

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:18.907
we need to understand the framework
on which everything else must be based.

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:20.950
Playing with toys is great.

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:24.087
Understanding how to keep
our life-support systems going is great.

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:26.504
But fundamentally, the thing
that we need to change

00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:28.356
in the way that we talk about physics,

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.539
is we need to understand

00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:31.879
that physics isn't out there
with weird people

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:33.383
and strange hieroglyphics

00:15:33.407 --> 00:15:35.029
for somebody else in a posh lab.

00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:38.103
Physics is right here; it's for us,
and we can all play with it.

00:15:38.127 --> 00:15:39.293
Thank you very much.

00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:41.317
(Applause)
