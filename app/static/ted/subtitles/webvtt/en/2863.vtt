00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.760
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120
[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.570
[whose wealth and resources
surpass all that Europe ever had,]

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.960
[whose altar is filled with gold.]

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.960
This chant is called the oríkì.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.000
My grandmother used to sing it
to me when I was a child in Nigeria.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.216
See, an oríkì is the song of praise
of the Yoruba people,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.000
and this particularly speaks
of treasures that the West does not have.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.936
Mama -- that's what
I call my grandmother --

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.440
told me many stories
about Yoruba mythology.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.936
You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group
from the southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.096
and I was always fascinated
by these stories.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.320
I was always intrigued.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.960
And Yoruba culture has inspired
my art since I was a child.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
You see, African art is not just what
you buy at Harlem markets in New York.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.576
Every artist has a name,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.000
and every artist has a story.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.000
This is my story.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.256
See, mama had tattoos
on her arms and her legs.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.536
As a child, I thought
she was born with them,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.840
with beautiful black lines
and detailed symbols.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.496
And then she told me

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.360
that they were actually symbols
from the Yoruba mythology.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.760
I never knew how this was going
to influence the artist that I am today.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.936
You see, as a young child,
I saw art everywhere.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.696
I remember the house we lived in
in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.296
We had marble floors,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.896
and you know, I would look
at the marble floors,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.576
and I would see all sorts
of patterns and designs in it,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.496
and I thought everybody could see them.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.776
So I would call my brother,
and I would be like,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.336
"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design,
see this pattern, see this mask."

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.816
And he would tell me,
"Laolu, I don't see anything."

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.936
So I would use ink, and I would trace out
what I saw on the floor.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.536
And then when my mom noticed,
she got really upset.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.136
(Laughter)

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.416
But that didn't stop me.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.096
I switched from ink to chalk,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.096
because I got in trouble a lot
with my teachers and my parents.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.016
So I remember my mom said,
"Laolu, we are Christians.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.856
Why don't you draw like other people?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.176
Why don't you draw landscapes
or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.440
or maybe even draw Jesus?"

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.136
You know, I could paint
the whole house if I had a chance,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.096
but when I grew up,
I knew being an artist was not an option,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.096
so I wanted to be the person
my parents wanted me to be,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.696
so I went to law school.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.400
Of course, that's my dad there.
He was so proud that day.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.816
And this was what my notebooks
looked like in law school.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.416
(Laughter)

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.936
Of course I would miss classes,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.240
and I would make up excuses
why I wasn't going to class.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.856
But when I started working
at the Human Rights Commission

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.216
as a human rights attorney,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.440
my mind was elsewhere.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.800
I saw a very tough reality.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.376
I worked with children

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.216
who had to choose
between getting an education

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.160
and actually being forced into marriage.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.536
I was so frustrated
seeing all the injustice around me,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.136
and my only outlet was art,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
so I started painting.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.016
This piece is called "Dreamscape."

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.656
So when you zoom into this piece,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.400
you're going to see a girl child

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.936
and the accidental birth,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.920
the fact that our future
is controlled by where we are born.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.096
Now, the next one you see
a man and a man holding hands,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.976
a woman and a woman holding hands.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.136
You see, in Nigeria,
same-sex relationship is criminalized.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.040
You can actually get 14 years for that.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.696
With my art, I like to tell stories.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.936
Through my art,
I like to start a conversation.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.176
So in this one, you see the map of Africa,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.056
you see the questions, you see crying,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.256
and there you see syringes
plugged into Africa

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.376
and the natural resources
being drained out.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.936
So I asked myself, where does it go?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.440
Who benefits from all of this?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.896
You see, with my art,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.776
the way I weave my art around
the patterns, the masks, the stories,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.136
and the way I use my lines,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.896
it's all from the Yoruba culture.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.456
So in 2013, I made a big gamble.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.816
I quit my job and I moved to New York City
to practice art full time.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.390
Of course, my parents were like,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.140
"Oh, [it's just a phase.]
He'll come back."

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.096
But life as an artist
in New York was not easy,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.136
because I was broke,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.096
no money, no gallery agents,
no representation,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.736
so no gallery would show my work.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.896
So I thought to myself, I need to survive.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.640
So I started painting on clothes
to make a living.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.880
I started painting on shoes.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.815
I started customizing things for people.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.536
And then soon I realized the power,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.216
because people were so proud
to wear their stories.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.176
So I started painting on everything.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.736
I painted on guitars,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.976
I started doing murals,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.056
anything I could find
my hand on I painted,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.896
and everything became my canvas.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.216
So one day, I was just going
on my Instagram feed,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.696
and I saw this picture.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.816
It was Reign. She took a picture
standing in front my art,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.576
and the moment I saw that photo,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.256
something happened in that moment.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.696
I could actually see my artwork
go into her and come out of her literally,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.080
and that's how I started painting
on human bodies.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.776
As a child I saw art on the marble floors,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.416
I saw art on walls,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.160
but now I see art on people's faces
and people's bodies.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.200
I remember my grandmother,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.816
and I realized that
most of my creative instincts

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.920
were actually based
on my childhood memories

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.720
and the art on my grandmother's skin.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.536
Now I look at all the people I painted,
and I think to myself, like,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.776
what would it look like
if we all walked around

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.976
like gods and goddesses
from Yoruba mythology?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.776
And boom, that's how
The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.296
You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.376
means your soul, it means your essence,
it means your instincts.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.896
And I realized that only
when you tap into your Ori,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.456
then you can actually move mountains.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.240
So there's something so immediate
about painting on human bodies.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.456
It's like art in motion.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.536
It's like a 3D experience.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.336
So one day, I was just doing
my regular work in Brooklyn,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.056
and I got an email that said,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.376
"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.416
Would you like to paint
for my music video?

00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.697
Signed, Beyoncé."

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.176
Like, Beyoncé emailed me.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.536
I was like, what?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.216
(Laughter)

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.296
I was like, what,
how did she even know me?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.336
I thought this can't be true.
Of course I thought it was a scam.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.976
The Nigerian in me was like, nah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.216
(Laughter)

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.376
(Applause)

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.856
But incredibly enough,
it was real, it was true,

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.456
and things happened really fast.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.976
You see, Beyoncé wanted
to pay homage to New Orleans,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.256
and my art reminded her
of her creole origins.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.616
So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.480
boom, everything just went
from zero to 100 real fast.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.576
People featured me in magazines,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.816
interviews.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.416
People stopped me in the street.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.896
People knew my name, like --

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.496
And sometimes I had to step back

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.576
and just chill,
and, like, take everything in.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.016
You know, as artists,
we work so hard all our lives

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.456
for our art to be recognized,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.840
and for this I feel blessed.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.296
However, the attorney
in me is still there,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.000
so I use my art
to fight for what I believe in.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.280
My Yoruba heritage is always there.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.736
I'd like to share with you tonight
some of my art in motion.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.096
Please, welcome with me on stage.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.856
(Music)

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.120
(Applause)

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.776
Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.096
These are the first two people
I ever painted in my life,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.400
and I spent the past day painting on them.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.040
Tonight, they represent
my hopes and my fears.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.160
Now, I put my fears on the back.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.600
I put my hopes in front.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.120
What are my hopes?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.696
I hope that people know

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.936
that Africa is not just
one huge, nameless continent

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.536
that is all the same.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.936
I also hope that people know

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.936
that in Nigeria, we have
over 350 ethnic groups and languages,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.080
and I am just one artist from one of them.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.376
(Applause)

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.376
I also hope that you know
that I hope I will be able to change

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.376
the way people talk about African art
on the continent and here,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.136
and I hope you know that African art

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.656
is not just what you buy
at Harlem markets in New York

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.536
and that every piece of art
you see has a story,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.176
and every artist has a name.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.416
Thank you very much.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.880
(Applause)
