WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.016
I'm Chetan Bhatt

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.240
and when I give my name,
I'm often asked, "Where are you from?"

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.920
And I normally say London.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.816
(Laughter)

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.336
But of course, I know
what they're really asking,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.376
so I say something like,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.976
"Well, my grandparents and my mum
were born in India,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.656
my dad and I were born in Kenya,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.576
and I was brought up in London.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.096
And then they've got me mapped.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.936
"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.
I've worked with one of those."

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.176
(Laughter)

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.576
And from my name they probably
assume that I'm a Hindu.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560
And this sort of fixes me for them.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.456
But what about the Christians

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.776
and the Muslims and the atheists

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.296
that I grew up with?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.816
Or the socialists and the liberals,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.416
even the occasional Tory?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.456
(Laughter)

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.296
Indeed, all kinds of women and men --

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.256
vegetable sellers, factory workers,
cooks, car mechanics --

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.776
living in my working class area,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.336
in some profoundly important way,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.056
they are also a part of me

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.640
and are here with me.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.176
Maybe that's why I find it hard
to respond to questions about identity

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.616
and about origin.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.520
And it's not just a sort of
teenage refusal to be labeled.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.696
It's about our own most identities,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.016
the ones that we put our hands up to,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.656
the ones that we cheer for,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.376
the ones that we fight for,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.216
the ones that we love or hate.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.336
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.016
as well as others.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.696
And it's about identities
we just assume that we have

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.960
without thinking too much about them.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.136
But our responses
to questions of identity and origin

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.920
have substantial
social and political importance.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.496
We see the wars, the rages of identity
going on all around us.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.976
We see violent religious,
national and ethnic disputes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.640
And often the conflict is based
on old stories of identity

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.136
and belonging

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.656
and origins.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.376
And these identities are based on myths,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.096
typically about ancient,
primordial origins.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.536
And these could be about Adam and Eve

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.496
or about the supremacy
of a caste or gender

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.416
or about the vitality of a supposed race

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.856
or about the past glories
of an empire or civilization

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.576
or about a piece of land

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.080
that some imagined deity has gifted.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.216
Now, people say

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.480
that origin stories and identity myths
make us feel secure.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.656
What's wrong with that?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.336
They give us a sense of belonging.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.066
Identity is your cultural clothing,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.300
and it can make you feel
warm and fuzzy inside.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.336
But does it really?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.336
Do we really need
identity myths to feel safe?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.376
Because I see religious,
national, ethnic disputes

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.680
as adding to human misery.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.136
Can I dare you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.096
to refuse every origin myth

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.320
that claims you?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.056
What if we reject
every single primordial origin myth

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.496
and develop a deeper sense of personhood,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.936
one responsible to humanity as a whole

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.416
rather than to a particular tribe,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.776
a radically different idea of humanity

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.776
that exposes how origin myths mystify,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.136
disguise global power,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.016
rapacious exploitation,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.976
poverty, the worldwide oppression
of women and girls,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
and of course massive,
accelerating inequalities?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.016
Now, origin myths
are closely linked to tradition,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.496
and the word tradition
points to something old

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.456
and permanent, almost natural,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.216
and people assume tradition
is just history,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.520
simply the past
condensed into a nice story.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.936
But let's not confuse
tradition with history.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600
The two are often in severe conflict.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.976
Origin stories are usually recently
created fictions of ancient belonging,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.256
and they're absurd

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.936
given the complexity of humanity

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.416
and our vastly interconnected,
even if very unequal world.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.016
And today we see claims to tradition

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.536
that claim to be ancient

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.440
changing rapidly in front of our eyes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.055
I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.096
with Asian, English, Caribbean,
Irish families living in our street,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.216
and the neo-Nazi National Front
was massive then

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.736
with regular marches and attacks on us

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.976
and a permanent threat

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.736
and often a frequent reality
of violence against us

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.960
on the streets, in our homes,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.336
typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.696
And I remember during a general election
a leaflet came through our letter box

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.240
with a picture of the National Front
candidate for our area.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.856
And the picture

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.400
was of our next-door neighbor.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.096
He threatened to shoot me once
when I played in the garden as a kid,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.816
and many weekends, shaven-headed
National Front activists

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.256
arrived at his house

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.496
and emerged with scores of placards

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.920
screaming that they wanted us
to go back home.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.640
But today he's one of my mum's best mates.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.696
He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.416
and at some point in his
political journey out of fascism

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.840
he embraced a broader idea of humanity.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.576
There was a Hindu family
that we got to know well --

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.976
and you have to understand
that life in our street

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.736
was a little bit like the setting
for an Asian soap opera.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.656
Everyone knew everyone else's business,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.376
even if they didn't want it
to be known by anyone at all.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.336
You really had no choice in this matter.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.976
But in this family,
there was a quiet little boy

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.816
who went to the same school as I did,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.656
and after I left school,
I didn't hear much more about him,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.600
except that he'd gone off to India.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.576
Now around 2000,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.840
I remember seeing this short book.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.456
The book was unusual

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.216
because it was written
by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.296
and in it the author calls
for attacks in Britain.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.256
This is in 1999,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.416
so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq
was still in the future,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.256
and he helped scout
New York bombing targets.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.096
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb
to use on the London Underground,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.560
and he plotted a massive bombing campaign
in London's shopping areas.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.256
He's a very high-risk security
prisoner in the UK

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.640
and one of the most important Al Qaeda
figures to be arrested in Britain.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.336
The author of that book

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.816
was the very same quiet little boy

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.040
who went to my school.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.296
So a Hindu boy from Britain

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.056
became an Al Qaeda fighter

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.136
and a most-wanted international terrorist,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.256
and he rejected what people would call
his Hindu or Indian or British identity,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.136
and he became someone else.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.016
He refused to be who he was.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.336
He recreated himself,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.656
and this kind of journey is very common

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.136
for young men and women

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.256
who become involved
in Al Qaeda or Islamic State

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.576
or other transnational armed groups.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.456
Al Qaeda's media spokesman
is a white American

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.936
from a Jewish and Catholic
mixed background,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.736
and neither he nor the boy from my school

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.456
were from Muslim backgrounds.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.216
There's no point in asking them
where are they from.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680
A more important question is
where they're going.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.256
And I would also put it to you

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.416
that exactly the same journey
occurs for those young men and women

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.376
who were brought up
in Muslim family backgrounds.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.216
Most of those who join Al Qaeda

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.216
and other Salafi jihadi groups
from Europe, Asia, North America,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.136
even in many cases the Middle East

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.096
are those who have comprehensively
rejected their backgrounds

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.200
to become, in essence, new people.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.136
They spend an enormous amount of time
attacking their parents' backgrounds

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.176
as profane, impure, blasphemous,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.496
the wrong type of Islam,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.016
and their vision instead

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.616
is a fantastical view
of cosmic apocalypse.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.976
It's a born again vision.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.416
Discard your past,
your society, your family and friends

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.600
since they're all impure.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.320
Instead, become someone else,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.520
your true self,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.760
your authentic self.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.056
Now, this isn't
about a return to the past.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.296
It's about using a forgery of the past

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.816
to envision an appalling future
which begins today at year zero.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.336
This is why over 80 percent of the victims
of Al Qaeda and Islamic State

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.056
are people from Muslim backgrounds.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.416
The first act by Salafi jihadi groups
when they take over an area

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.536
is to destroy existing Muslim institutions

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.520
including mosques,
shrines, preachers, practices.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.896
Their main purpose is to control
and punish people internally,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.616
to dictate the spaces that women may go,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.776
their clothing, family relations,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.096
beliefs, even the minute detail
of how one prays.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.216
And you get the impression in the news

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.496
that they are after us in the West,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.080
but they are actually mainly after
people from other Muslim backgrounds.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.336
In their view, no other Muslim
can ever be pure enough,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.456
so ordinary beliefs and practices
that have existed for centuries

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.456
are attacked as impure

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.656
by teenagers from Birmingham or London

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.400
who know nothing

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.880
about the histories
that they so joyously obliterate.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.656
Now here, their claim to tradition
is at war with history,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.736
but they're nevertheless
very certain about their purity

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.080
and about the impurity of others.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.720
Purity,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.256
certainty,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.016
the return to authentic tradition,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.336
the quest for these
can lead to lethal visions

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.376
of perfect societies and perfected people.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.656
This is what the main Hindu
fundamentalist organization in India

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.960
looks like today at its mass rally.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.056
Maybe it reminds you
of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.296
and the movement's roots
are indeed in fascism.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.056
It was a member of the same
Hindu fundamentalist movement

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.920
who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.176
Hindu fundamentalists today
view this murderer as a national hero,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.016
and they want to put up
statues of him throughout India.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.656
They've been involved for decades

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.216
in large-scale mass violence
against minorities.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.856
They ban books, art, films.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.136
They attack romantic couples
on Valentine's Day,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.216
Christians on Christmas Day.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.136
They don't like others talking critically

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.776
about what they see
as their ancient culture

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.296
or using its images

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.936
or caricaturing it

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.520
or drawing cartoons about it.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.176
But the people making
the strongest possible claims

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.096
about ancient, timeless Hindu religion

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.736
are dressed in brown shorts
and white shirts

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.416
while claiming, oddly,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.296
to be the original Aryan race,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.736
just like the violent Salafi jihadis

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.736
who make their claims
about their primordial religion

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.216
while dressed in black military uniforms

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.760
and wearing balaclavas.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.336
These people are manufacturing
pure, pristine identities of conviction

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.576
and of certainty.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.160
Fundamentalists see religion and culture
as their sole property, a property.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.576
But religions and cultures are processes.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.976
They're not things. They're impermanent.
They're messy. They're impure.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.736
Look at any religion
and you'll see disputes and arguments

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760
going all the way down.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.560
Any criticism of religion in any form

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.296
has to therefore be

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.896
part of the expansive sense of humanity

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.120
we should aspire to.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.856
I respect your right
to have and to express your religion

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.496
or your culture or your opinion,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.376
but I don't necessarily
have to respect the content.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.656
I might like some of it.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.496
I might like how an old church
looks, for example,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.040
but this isn't the same thing.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.576
Similarly, I have a human right

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.736
to say something
that you may find offensive,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.240
but you do not have a human right
not to be offended.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.016
In a genuine democracy,
we're constantly offended

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.816
since people express
different views all the time.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.680
They also change their views,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.896
so their views are impermanent.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.216
You cannot fix someone's political views

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.360
based on their religious
or national or cultural background.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.656
Now, these points about religious purity

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.080
also apply to nationalism and to racism.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.520
I'm always puzzled

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.480
to have pride in your national
or ethnic identity,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.320
pride in the accident of birth
from a warm and cozy womb,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.960
belief in your superiority
because of the accident of birth.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.536
These people have very firm ideas

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.560
about what belongs and what doesn't belong

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.256
inside the cozy national cultures
that they imagine.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.096
And I'm going to caricature a bit here,
but only a little bit.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.376
I want you to imagine
the supporter of some Little Englander

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.296
or British nationalist political party,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.696
and he's sitting at home

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.576
and he's screaming about foreigners

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.416
invading his country

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.376
while watching Fox News,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.576
an American cable channel

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.056
owned by an Australian

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.216
on his South Korean television set

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.816
which was bought
by his Spanish credit card

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.096
which is paid off monthly
by his high-street British bank

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.760
which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.416
He supports a British football team
owned by a Russian.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.176
His favorite brand of fish and chips

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.856
is owned by a Swedish
venture capitalist firm.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.376
The church he sometimes goes to

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.840
has its creed decided
in meetings in Ghana.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.360
His Union Jack underpants

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.536
were made in India.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.816
(Laughter)

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.056
And --

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.016
(Applause)

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.256
Thank you.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.216
And they're laundered regularly

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.016
by a very nice Polish lady.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.240
(Laughter)

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.016
There is no pure ethnicity,
national culture,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.136
and the ethical choices we have today

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.136
are far wider than being forced to choose

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.616
between racist right
and religious right visions,

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.720
dismal visions of culture.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.696
Now, culture isn't just
about language, food, clothing and music,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.016
but gender relations, ancient monuments,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.560
a heritage of sacred texts.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.896
But culture can also be
what has been decided to be culture

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.696
by those who have a political stake

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.360
in pounding culture
into the shape of a prison.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.256
Big political identity claims
are elite bids for power.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.376
They're not answers to social
or economic or political injustices.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.000
They often obscure them.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.296
And what about the large number
of people across the globe

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.496
who can't point
to a monument from their past,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.856
who don't possess a sacred written text,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.936
who can't hark back

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.656
to the past glories
of a civilization or empire?

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.640
Are these people less a part of humanity?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.136
What about you,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.416
now, listening to this?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.096
What about you and your identity,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.496
because you stitch your experiences
and your thoughts into a continuous person

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.616
moving forward in time.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.496
And this is what you are when you say,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.520
"I," "am," or "me."

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.736
But this also includes
all of your hopes and dreams,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.256
all of the you's that could have been,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.616
and it includes all the other people

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.896
and the things that are
in the biography of who you are.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.936
They, the others,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.736
are also a part of you,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.720
moving forward with you.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.496
Your authentic self,
if such a thing exists,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.656
is a complex, messy and uncertain self,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.840
and that is a very good thing.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.456
Why not value those
impurities and uncertainties?

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.296
Maybe clinging to pure identities
is a sign of immaturity,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.416
and ethnic, nationalist
and religious traditions are bad for you.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.296
Why not be skeptical
about every primordial origin claim

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.776
made on your behalf?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.480
Why not reject the identity myths
that call on you to belong,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.536
that politicians and community leaders,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.376
so-called community leaders,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.656
place on you?

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.336
If we don't need origin stories
and fixed identities,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.656
we can challenge ourselves
to think creatively

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.256
about each other and our future.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.216
And here culture
always takes care of itself.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.696
I'm not worried about culture.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.136
Cultures are creative, dynamic processes,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.200
not imposed laws and boundaries.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.616
This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad
ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.576
a very senior Muslim judge and thinker
in Cordoba in the 12th century,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.736
and his writings were considered
deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.136
Long after he died,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.536
followers of his work
were ruthlessly hunted down,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.296
banished and killed over several centuries

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.760
by the most powerful religious institution
of the medieval period.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.400
That institution was
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.256
Why?

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.016
Because ibn Rushd said
that something true in religion

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.376
may conflict with something

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.400
that your reason
finds to be true on earth,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.880
but the latter is still true.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.536
There are two distinct worlds of truth,

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.456
one based on our reason and evidence,
and one that is divine,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.376
and the state, political power, social law
are in the realm of reason.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.336
Religious life is a different realm.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.096
They should be kept separated.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.696
Social and political life
should be governed by our reason,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.176
not by religion.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.896
And you can see why the church
was upset by his writings,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.416
as indeed were some Muslims
during his lifetime,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.960
because he gives us
a strong statement of secularism

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.080
of a kind which is normal in Europe today.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.656
Now, history plays many tricks on us.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.376
It undermines our fixed truths

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.216
and what we believe
to be our culture and their culture.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.696
Ibn Rushd, someone
who happens to be a Muslim,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.656
is considered one of the key influences

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.320
in the introduction and spread
of secularism in Europe.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.216
So against religious, nationalist
and racial purists of all kinds,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.456
can you make his story a part of your own,

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.376
not because he happened to be a Muslim,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.376
not because he happened to be an Arab,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.120
but because he was a human being

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.776
with some very good ideas

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.160
that shook his world

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.120
and ours.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.016
Thank you.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.680
(Applause)
