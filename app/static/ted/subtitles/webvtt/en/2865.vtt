00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.674
This is my favorite place on earth,

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:05.698
Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:10.408
And when it's covered
in a thin layer of water,

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.599
it reflects the clouds.

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:16.047
There are days when you feel
as if you're floating among the clouds.

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:19.449
But there are days
when the horizon disappears;

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:21.893
there's no longer a top or a bottom.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.938
You feel immersed in something bigger.

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:30.421
It was there that one night
I woke up from a dream,

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:33.329
and I saw that the stars
were also reflected on the water.

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:35.437
And that wasn't a dream.

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.274
It was as if you could walk
among the stars.

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:41.645
With every step I took,
the stars reverberated under my feet.

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:46.597
It was like I was floating in the universe
among clouds of galaxies.

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:50.983
But what's floating there today
are not just clouds of galaxies

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.189
but also clouds of plastic.

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:56.140
These are the footprints
we're leaving on the planet.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.006
They're signs of an era

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.984
in which the behavior of some humans
is making a global impact

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.471
on our ecosystems.

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:08.870
This era is called the Anthropocene.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:13.004
There's also another type
of toxic clouds that float in the air,

00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:15.964
like the ones that form
from carbon dioxide emissions

00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:19.427
and from the burning of fossil fuels --
oil, carbon, gas --

00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.641
clouds that, when we see them,

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.231
pollute our dreams.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:25.874
I don't know about all of you,

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.510
but I've always dreamed of floating
among the clouds.

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:32.107
Maybe today we can imagine together
other types of clouds,

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.914
clouds we can live with.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.171
If you're wondering
about that photo, I'll explain:

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:40.138
it looks like a collage
or photomontage -- something weird.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.518
No; it's reality.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.068
But sometimes I ask myself:
What is reality?

00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:45.761
According to Alexander Kluge:

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.349
"Human beings are not
interested in reality.

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:51.631
They canâ€™t be; itâ€™s part
of the human essence.

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:53.136
They have desires.

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.381
These desires are totally opposed
to any form of reality.

00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.097
They prefer to lie

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.314
than to become divorced
from their desires."

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.392
But how can we learn
to float among the clouds?

00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:11.894
As an artist, I thought we could start
building a flying museum.

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.602
You're probably wondering:
With plastic bags?

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:17.566
In 2007, with a community of people
all over the world,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.468
we began to collect used plastic bags --

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:22.056
not new ones.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
And we washed them,

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:26.298
we cut them up,

00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:27.749
we glued them together,

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.717
and we began to draw on them,

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:31.564
creating a huge canvas.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.588
We made a collection of drawings,

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:34.890
of personal stories

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:36.518
and of friendships.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.354
And when you join them,

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:40.378
bend them and fold them,

00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:42.773
it creates a space full of air.

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.991
When the sun comes up from the horizon,

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.173
the museum rises up to the sky.

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.508
That's why we call it,
"The Aero-Solar Museum."

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:51.849
And from this simple idea,

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.760
we learned how to float in the air
in a radically new way,

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:57.004
without using any type of fuel.

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.719
The difference in temperature
between the interior and the exterior

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.743
is what makes us rise up.

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:04.262
That way,

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:09.479
we don't use fossil fuels
or helium or hydrogen;

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:11.669
we don't use solar panels

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:13.693
or batteries or motors.

00:03:14.248 --> 00:03:19.538
We discovered a way that's simple,
clean and accessible to the whole world

00:03:19.562 --> 00:03:20.952
to lift ourselves up.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:25.706
I remember when I was at NASA in 2009
with 120 engineers.

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:28.995
You guys know, too,
when you go up in a plane,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.082
the control panels are gigantic.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:34.722
And what we're doing is really complex,

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.718
and when I started coming in
with the plastic bags, saying,

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:39.401
"But we have a different way ..."

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:41.765
people had a hard time
understanding the concept.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.333
Seeing the power of this idea,

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:44.996
we started to initiate a new era;

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.994
one that would leave behind
the violence of the Anthropocene

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:49.505
and give way to a new era,

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.599
which we call the "Aerocene" --

00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:54.439
an era of ecological awareness,

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.640
in which we learn to float together,
live together in the air,

00:03:57.664 --> 00:03:59.329
and come to an ethical commitment

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:01.501
with the atmosphere and with planet earth.

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:04.598
That's why I've brought
this backpack today.

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:05.786
Let's see ...

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:18.384
OK. This is a balloon
that we also refer to as a sculpture.

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:21.298
And if it's sunny out tomorrow,
we can go out and fly --

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:23.634
though, no, the weather
in Vancouver isn't --

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:25.114
(Laughter)

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:27.206
it's not very ...

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.415
very favorable.

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.599
So, what other features does it have?

00:04:31.623 --> 00:04:33.986
It has sensors that, when it moves,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.010
make sort of drawings in the air.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.693
It also has other sensors.

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:40.917
I always think that first
you have to feel it,

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:42.588
and then you can measure it;

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:45.325
you need to hear the sounds
of the atmosphere,

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.883
of the climate, of the hot air,

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:48.978
in order to then measure the ozone,

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.795
the carbon dioxide.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.360
We're developing these sensors

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.061
together with different communities
all over the world

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:58.890
in order to reconnect with the climate,
the temperature and the environment,

00:04:58.914 --> 00:05:01.128
because there are other
species in the air;

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:03.200
in these excursions
towards the atmosphere,

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:04.387
we're not alone.

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:06.171
The air is full of clouds of life.

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:09.031
We live at the bottom of an ocean of air.

00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:11.268
And this same sculpture,

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:14.060
this exact one in my hands,

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.861
flew 375 miles -- 12 hours --
from Germany to Poland,

00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:18.063
on a fuel-free trip.

00:05:18.087 --> 00:05:20.240
But it wasn't free from crossing borders.

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:23.130
The trip was much more complicated
than what we imagined;

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:25.272
air space is as regulated and militarized

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:26.827
as land space.

00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:29.872
To fly using the winds,
the heat of the sun

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.634
and the radiant energy of the earth

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.269
is complex and beautiful.

00:05:33.943 --> 00:05:36.317
But even more complex
will be getting the permits

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.381
to cross the air space
of each of the different countries

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.196
that we fly over using wind.

00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:45.597
At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,

00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:47.743
we presented these spherical sculptures

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:50.293
that could transport us
all over the world.

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:54.199
But how can we fly using the wind
to arrive at our destination?

00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:56.672
Together with MIT, we developed a program

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.776
that predicts how we can navigate
the wind highways.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.821
For example, if I had to return
to Berlin from Vancouver,

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.536
the first thing I would need to do
is choose an altitude.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.248
At different altitudes,
there are different directions

00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:11.135
and different speeds.

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:15.158
The red line is tomorrow
and the orange, the day after tomorrow.

00:06:15.182 --> 00:06:16.350
And there it goes.

00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:19.436
You can see, the best day
to fly back to Berlin --

00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:23.075
so now, traveling using only wind --

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:25.555
is in six days.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:28.637
And we can get to 105 miles
from the center of Berlin

00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:30.570
without burning a single drop of fuel,

00:06:30.594 --> 00:06:33.481
being transported only by wind currents.

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:37.383
So we thought that these trajectories
that we drew with the wind

00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:42.040
could become signatures, declaring
"Independence from Fossil Fuels Day."

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:45.378
More and more of us
are experiencing the air

00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:46.608
in a different way.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.260
You're all familiar with Earth Day.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.024
We think we should also celebrate Air Day:

00:06:52.048 --> 00:06:54.034
it's a pact that we make with the earth,

00:06:54.058 --> 00:06:56.170
an ethical commitment to the atmosphere.

00:06:57.853 --> 00:06:59.905
But let's keep thinking and dreaming.

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:03.094
We've learned that the bigger
the sculptures are,

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.857
the more weight they can lift.

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.074
Remember,

00:07:08.647 --> 00:07:13.196
they rise up only with hot air
that's been heated by the sun.

00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:17.735
Using this approach, we can learn
to build gardens in the air.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.718
Could we one day live in a garden
the size of the earth?

00:07:21.448 --> 00:07:24.563
Could we live in an ecosystem
floating among the clouds?

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:29.071
Answering these questions
isn't just a technological challenge;

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:33.288
it's a way to reexamine
the freedom of movement between countries,

00:07:34.302 --> 00:07:38.089
and of overcoming the political,
social, cultural and military restrictions

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:39.801
of contemporary societies.

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.498
Because in the end,

00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:43.219
the air belongs to everybody

00:07:43.243 --> 00:07:45.576
and doesn't answer to any government.

00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:52.848
(Applause)

00:07:53.388 --> 00:07:54.709
And like we said earlier,

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:58.864
our imagination is the force
that allows us to create these places.

00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:00.579
This is an installation I did

00:08:00.603 --> 00:08:03.010
at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York.

00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:04.311
It asks the question:

00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:07.079
What might these transnational
spaces be like?

00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:11.238
And once we inhabit those spaces,
we need to learn how to move within them,

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:14.039
to walk among the clouds,

00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:17.944
where every movement affects
everyone else's movements;

00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:21.145
the body weight and proximity
between people

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:23.193
will cause the space to expand ...

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:24.564
or contract.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.525
There we are, suspended
72 feet in the air.

00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:32.763
When two or more people
get too close together,

00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:36.192
even those farthest away are affected --

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:38.517
everyone falls to the same spot.

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:40.722
These are fragile ecosystems.

00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:46.289
And it's between these spheres
that we build nets that connect us.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.731
There are moments
when we have to face the void,

00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:51.755
and fear can paralyze us.

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.912
One of the most beautiful things
about this exhibit

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:56.713
is the sense of solidarity generated

00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:59.157
when we face these new "aero-graphs."

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:01.449
Finally,

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.473
let me tell you one last story.

00:09:03.497 --> 00:09:05.671
On July 16, 1945,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.695
on the White Sands of New Mexico,

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:10.935
an atomic bomb was detonated
for the first time.

00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:13.311
As a result of this explosion,

00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:17.909
a cloud of radioactive particles
disseminated all over the earth,

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.802
marking the beginning
of the Anthropocene era.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.737
Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:26.315
in the same place,

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:27.723
another event occurred.

00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.315
For the first time in history,

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:33.497
we lifted a person into the air
using only the sun,

00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:36.294
without burning any fossil fuels.

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:38.820
As the sun rose up above the horizon,

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.481
we rose up, too,

00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:42.169
silently,

00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:43.360
slowly,

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.890
with no explosions.

00:09:44.914 --> 00:09:47.550
We felt as if gravity had been inverted;

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.951
it wasn't pulling us
toward the center of the earth,

00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:52.679
but toward the universe.

00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:56.016
If Neil Armstrong said,
when he walked on the moon,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.806
"That's one small step for man,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.830
one giant leap for mankind,"

00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:02.631
perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:

00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:05.355
What steps do we need to take today?

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.811
In the Aerocene era,

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:11.505
our steps are much smaller,
but radically different;

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.252
they're steps that began with a bag
full of air and wishes,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.210
but that can carry us
to independence from fossil fuels

00:10:21.234 --> 00:10:23.243
and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:26.584
steps that won't leave footprints
on other planets

00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:30.859
until we've learned to walk
in the atmosphere of this one.

00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:32.938
The landscapes are tiny

00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:34.532
and the steps are tiny,

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:36.954
but I hope we can take them together.

00:10:36.978 --> 00:10:40.802
And I'm sure that these steps will lead us
much further than the moon,

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:44.726
so we can learn to float
with our feet on the ground.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.912
Thank you.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:49.706
(Applause)
