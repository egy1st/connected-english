WEBVTT

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.960
We are all activists now.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.896
(Applause)

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.120
Thank you.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.016
I'll just stop here.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.216
(Laughter)

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
From the families who are fighting
to maintain funding for public schools,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.016
the tens of thousands of people
who joined Occupy Wall Street

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.216
or marched with Black Lives Matter

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.800
to protest police brutality
against African Americans,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.256
families that join rallies,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.280
pro-life and pro-choice,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.336
those of us who are afraid

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.736
that our friends and neighbors
are going to be deported

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.736
or that they'll be added to lists

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.080
because they are Muslim,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.720
people who advocate for gun rights
and for gun control

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.136
and the millions of people
who joined the women's marches

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.936
all across the country this last January.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.616
(Applause)

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.736
We are all activists now,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.240
and that means that we all have something
to worry about from surveillance.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.016
Surveillance means
government collection and use

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.256
of private and sensitive data about us.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.216
And surveillance is essential

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.336
to law enforcement
and to national security.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.336
But the history of surveillance

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.856
is one that includes surveillance abuses

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.336
where this sensitive information
has been used against people

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.896
because of their race,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.696
their national origin,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.776
their sexual orientation,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.976
and in particular,
because of their activism,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.600
their political beliefs.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.376
About 53 years ago,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.936
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
gave his "I have a dream" speech

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.240
on the Mall in Washington.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.736
And today the ideas behind this speech
of racial equality and tolerance

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.696
are so noncontroversial

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.400
that my daughters
study the speech in third grade.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.496
But at the time,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.920
Dr. King was extremely controversial.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.016
The legendary and notorious
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.856
or wanted to believe,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.455
that the Civil Rights Movement
was a Soviet communist plot

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.640
intended to destabilize
the American government.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.336
And so Hoover had his agents
put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.896
and those bugs picked up conversations
between civil rights leaders

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.360
talking about the strategies and tactics
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.296
They also picked up sounds of Dr. King

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.176
having sex with women
who were not his wife,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.936
and J. Edgar Hoover
saw the opportunity here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.600
to discredit and undermine
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.016
The FBI sent a package of these recordings

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120
along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.560
and a draft of this note
was found in FBI archives years later,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.016
and the letter said,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.816
"You are no clergyman and you know it.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.400
King, like all frauds,
your end is approaching."

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.880
The letter even seemed
to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.336
saying, "King, there is
only one thing left for you to do.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.936
You know what it is.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.296
You better take it before
your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.176
is bared to the nation."

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.616
But the important thing is,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.320
Dr. King was not abnormal.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.040
Every one of us has something
that we want to hide from somebody.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.816
And even more important,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.320
J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.016
The history of surveillance abuses

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.440
is not the history
of one bad, megalomaniacal man.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.096
Throughout his decades at the FBI,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.856
J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support
of the presidents that he served,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.160
Democratic and Republican alike.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.016
After all, it was John F. Kennedy
and his brother Robert Kennedy

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000
who knew about and approved
the surveillance of Dr. King.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.056
Hoover ran a program
called COINTELPRO for 15 years

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.856
which was designed
to spy on and undermine civic groups

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.616
that were devoted
to things like civil rights,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.376
the Women's Rights Movement,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.136
and peace groups and anti-war movements.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.519
And the surveillance didn't stop there.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.656
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.696
during the election campaign,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.696
had the campaign airplane
of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.520
as part of his effort
to win that election.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.880
And then, of course, there was Watergate.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.976
Burglars were caught

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.856
breaking into the Democratic
National Committee headquarters

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.416
at the Watergate Hotel,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.616
the Nixon administration was involved
in covering up the burglary,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.120
and eventually Nixon
had to step down as president.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.776
COINTELPRO and Watergate
were a wake-up call for Americans.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.656
Surveillance was out of control

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.520
and it was being used
to squelch political challengers.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.776
And so Americans rose to the occasion

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.240
and what we did was
we reformed surveillance law.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.536
And the primary tool we used
to reform surveillance law

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.256
was to require a search warrant

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.240
for the government to be able to get
access to our phone calls and our letters.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.576
Now, the reason why
a search warrant is important

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.936
is because it interposes a judge

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.576
in the relationship
between investigators and the citizens,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.576
and that judge's job is to make sure

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.216
that there's good cause
for the surveillance,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.656
that the surveillance
is targeted at the right people,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.176
and that the information that's collected

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.816
is going to be used
for legitimate government purposes

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.776
and not for discriminatory ones.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.016
This was our system,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.296
and what this means is

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.136
that President Obama
did not wiretap Trump Tower.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.976
The system is set up to prevent
something like that from happening

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.840
without a judge being involved.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.080
But what happens when we're not talking
about phone calls or letters anymore?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.216
Today, we have technology

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.416
that makes it cheap and easy
for the government to collect information

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.120
on ordinary everyday people.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.256
Your phone call records

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.896
can reveal whether you have an addiction,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.376
what your religion is,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.056
what charities you donate to,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.560
what political candidate you support.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.136
And yet, our government
collected, dragnet-style,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.120
Americans' calling records for years.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.456
In 2012, the Republican
National Convention

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.856
highlighted a new technology
it was planning to use,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.376
facial recognition,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.376
to identify people
who were going to be in the crowd

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.856
who might be activists or troublemakers

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.440
and to stop them ahead of time.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.896
Today, over 50 percent of American adults

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.320
have their faceprint
in a government database.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.216
The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.776
concocted a plan

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.336
to find out what Americans
were going to gun shows

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.856
by using license plate detectors

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.976
to scan the license plates of cars

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.240
that were in the parking lots
of these events.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.296
Today, we believe that over 70 percent
of police departments

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.416
have automatic license plate
detection technology

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.880
that they're using to track people's cars
as they drive through town.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.576
And all of this information,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.536
the license plates, the faceprints,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.136
the phone records,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.976
your address books, your buddy lists,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.416
the photos that you upload
to Dropbox or Google Photos,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.416
and sometimes even
your chats and your emails

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.000
are not protected
by a warrant requirement.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.336
So what that means is we have
all of this information on regular people

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.560
that's newly available
at very low expense.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120
It is the golden age for surveillance.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.776
Now, every parent is going
to understand what this means.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.936
When you have a little baby

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.896
and the baby's young,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.176
that child is not able
to climb out of its crib.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.096
But eventually your little girl gets older

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.056
and she's able to climb out of the crib,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.856
but you tell her,
"Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.056
And every parent knows
what's going to happen.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.080
Some of those babies
are going to climb out of the crib.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:38.216
Right? That's the difference
between ability and permission.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.856
Well, the same thing is true
with the government today.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.655
It used to be that our government
didn't have the ability

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.256
to do widespread, massive surveillance
on hundreds of millions of Americans

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.840
and then abuse that information.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.376
But now our government has grown up,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.360
and we have that technology today.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.776
The government has the ability,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.376
and that means the law
is more important than ever before.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.136
The law is supposed to say

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.176
when the government
has permission to do it,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.336
and it's supposed to ensure
that there's some kind of ramification.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.856
We notice when those laws are broken

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.576
and there's some of kind of
ramification or punishment.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.016
The law is more important than ever
because we are now living in a world

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.136
where only rules
are stopping the government

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.600
from abusing this information.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.440
But the law has fallen down on the job.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.776
Particularly since September 11
the law has fallen down on the job,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.480
and we do not have
the rules in place that we need.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.840
And we are seeing
the ramifications of that.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.456
So fusion centers
are these joint task forces

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.776
between local, state
and federal government

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.016
that are meant to ferret out
domestic terrorism.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.536
And what we've seen
is fusion center reports

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.336
that say that you might be dangerous

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.296
if you voted for a third-party candidate,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.496
or you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.280
or you watched movies that are anti-tax.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.656
These same fusion centers have spied
on Muslim community groups' reading lists

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.000
and on Quakers who are resisting
military recruiting in high schools.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.856
The Internal Revenue Service
has disproportionately audited

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.536
groups that have "Tea Party"
or "Patriot" in their name.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.136
And now customs and border patrol

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.936
is stopping people
as they come into the country

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.136
and demanding our social
networking passwords

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.736
which will allow them
to see who our friends are,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.976
what we say

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.720
and even to impersonate us online.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.176
Now, civil libertarians like myself

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.336
have been trying to draw
people's attention to these things

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.936
and fighting against them for years.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.160
This was a huge problem
during the Obama administration,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.240
but now the problem is worse.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.976
When the New York Police Department

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.696
spies on Muslims

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.576
or a police department
uses license plate detectors

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.496
to find out where
the officers' spouses are

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.776
or those sorts of things,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.240
that is extremely dangerous.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.976
But when a president repurposes the power

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.496
of federal surveillance
and the federal government

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.576
to retaliate against political opposition,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.800
that is a tyranny.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.800
And so we are all activists now,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.960
and we all have something
to fear from surveillance.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.536
But just like in the time
of Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.640
we can reform the way things are.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.320
First of all, use encryption.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.016
Encryption protects your information

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.856
from being inexpensively
and opportunistically collected.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.000
It rolls back the golden age
for surveillance.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.840
Second, support surveillance reform.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.896
Did you know that if you have a friend

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.016
who works for the French
or German governments

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.176
or for an international human rights group

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.576
or for a global oil company

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.560
that your friend is a valid
foreign intelligence target?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.056
And what that means is that when
you have conversations with that friend,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.240
the US government
may be collecting that information.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.576
And when that information is collected,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.776
even though it's
conversations with Americans,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.896
it can then be funneled to the FBI

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.376
where the FBI is allowed
to search through it

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.776
without getting a warrant,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.456
without probable cause,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.696
looking for information about Americans

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.136
and whatever crimes we may have committed

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.200
with no need to document
any kind of suspicion.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.896
The law that allows some of this to happen

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.016
is called Section 702
of the FISA Amendments Act,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.576
and we have a great opportunity this year,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.336
because Section 702
is going to expire at the end of 2017,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.976
which means that
Congress's inertia is on our side

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.576
if we want reform.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.296
And we can pressure our representatives

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.816
to actually implement
important reforms to this law

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.200
and protect our data
from this redirection and misuse.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.576
And finally, one of the reasons
why things have gotten so out of control

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.496
is because so much
of what happens with surveillance --

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.056
the technology, the enabling rules
and the policies

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.656
that are either there
or not there to protect us --

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.096
are secret or classified.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.336
We need transparency,
and we need to know as Americans

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.896
what the government is doing in our name

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.496
so that the surveillance that takes place
and the use of that information

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.000
is democratically accounted for.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.496
We are all activists now,

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.160
which means that we all have something
to worry about from surveillance.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.136
But like in the time
of Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.456
there is stuff that we can do about it.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.400
So please join me, and let's get to work.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.216
Thank you.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.000
(Applause)
