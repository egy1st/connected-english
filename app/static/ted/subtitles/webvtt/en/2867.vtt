00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.576
When someone mentions Cuba,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.800
what do you think about?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.256
Classic, classic cars?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.600
Perhaps good cigars?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.696
Maybe you think
of a famous baseball player.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.056
What about when somebody
mentions North Korea?

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.175
You think about those missile tests,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.096
maybe their notorious leader

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.136
(Laughter)

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.496
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.280
is a vision of a country,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.216
an open economy,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.759
whose citizens have access to a wide range
of affordable consumer products.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.856
I'm not here to argue how these countries
got to where they are today.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.576
I simply want to use them
as an example of countries and citizens

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.816
who have been affected,
negatively affected,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.120
by a trade policy that restricts imports

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.480
and protects local industries.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.376
Recently we've heard a number of countries

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.576
talk about restricting imports

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.616
and protecting their local,
domestic industries.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.896
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.160
but what it really is is protectionism.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.920
We heard a lot about this
during the 2016 presidential election.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.056
We heard about it
during the Brexit debates

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.400
and most recently
during the French elections.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.416
In fact, it's been
a really important topic

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.576
being talked about around the world,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.016
and many aspiring political leaders

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.600
are running on platforms
positioning protectionism as a good thing.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.576
Now, I could see why they think
protectionism is good,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.720
because sometimes
it seems like trade is unfair.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.056
Some have blamed trade

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.216
for some of the problems
we've been having here at home in the US.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.616
For years we've been hearing

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.840
about the loss of high-paying
US manufacturing jobs.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.136
Many think that manufacturing
is declining in the US

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.296
because companies are moving
their operations offshore

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.736
to markets with lower-cost labor

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.320
like China, Mexico and Vietnam.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.376
They also think trade agreements
sometimes are unfair,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.096
like NAFTA

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.936
and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.416
because these trade agreements
allow companies

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.680
to reimport those cheaply
produced goods back into the US

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.856
and other countries
from where the jobs were taken.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.976
So it kind of feels like the exporters win

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the importers lose.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.176
Now, the reality is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.120
output in the manufacturing
sector in the US

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.816
is actually growing,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.416
but we are losing jobs.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.680
We're losing lots of them.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.096
In fact, from 2000 to 2010,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.760
5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.120
But they're not being lost
for the reasons you might think.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.960
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.056
didn't lose his jobs at the factory

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.536
to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.776
No.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.080
Mike lost his job to a machine.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.896
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.736
have been eliminated
because we've made improvements

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.320
in our own productivity
through automation.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.416
So that means that one out of 10
lost manufacturing jobs

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
was due to offshoring.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.096
Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.336
No.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.696
In fact, automation is spreading
to every production line

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.640
in every country around the world.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.336
But look, I get it:

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.856
if you just lost your job

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.536
and then you read in the newspaper

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.176
that your old company
just struck up a deal with China,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.656
it's easy to think you were just replaced

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.880
in a one-for-one deal.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.056
When I hear stories like this,
I think that what people picture

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.360
is that trade happens
between only two countries.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.536
Manufacturers in one country

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.496
produce products and they export them

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.160
to consumers in other countries,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.016
and it feels like
the manufacturing countries win

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.600
and the importing countries lose.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.040
Well, reality's a little bit different.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.976
I'm a supply chain professional,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760
and I live and work in Mexico.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.776
And I work in the middle

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.976
of a highly connected network
of manufacturers

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.136
all collaborating from around the world

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560
to produce many
of the products we use today.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.816
What I see

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.416
from my front-row seat in Mexico City

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.760
actually looks more like this.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
And this is a more accurate depiction
of what trade really looks like.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.616
I've had the pleasure of being able to see

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.136
how many different products
are manufactured,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.976
from golf clubs to laptop computers

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.576
to internet servers, automobiles

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.800
and even airplanes.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.280
And believe me, none of it
happens in a straight line.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.726
Let me give you an example.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.776
A few months ago, I was touring
the manufacturing plant

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.776
of a multinational aerospace company

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.080
in QuerÃ©taro, Mexico,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.480
and the VP of logistics points out
a completed tail assembly.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.816
It turns out the tail assemblies
are assembled from panels

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.336
that are manufactured in France,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.576
and they're assembled in Mexico

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.520
using components imported from the US.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.056
When those tail assemblies are done,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.536
they're exported via truck to Canada

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.736
to their primary assembly plant

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.016
where they come together

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.456
with thousands of other parts,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.856
like the wings and the seats

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.776
and the little shades
over the little windows,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.200
all coming in to become
a part of a new airplane.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.680
Think about it.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.776
These new airplanes,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.376
before they even take their first flight,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.856
they have more stamps in their passports

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.120
than Angelina Jolie.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.256
Now, this approach to processing
goes on all around the world

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.776
to manufacture many of the products

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.336
we use every day,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.680
from skin cream to airplanes.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.960
When you go home tonight,
take a look in your house.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.880
You might be surprised to find
a label that looks like this one:

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.280
"Manufactured in the USA
from US and foreign parts."

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.336
Economist Michael Porter

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.320
described what's going on here best.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.576
Many decades ago, he said
that it's most beneficial for a country

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.976
to focus on producing the products
it can produce most efficiently

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.760
and trading for the rest.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.760
So what he's talking about here
is shared production,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.400
and efficiency is the name of the game.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.256
You've probably seen an example of this

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.640
at home or at work.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.536
Let's take a look at an example.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.680
Think about how your house was built

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.920
or your kitchen renovated.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.056
Typically, there's a general contractor

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.296
who is responsible
for coordinating the efforts

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.936
of all the different contractors:

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.600
an architect to draw the plans,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.416
an earth-moving company
to dig the foundation,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.320
a plumber, a carpenter and so on.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.856
So why doesn't the general contractor

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.496
pick just one company

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.736
to do all the work,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.960
like, say, the architect?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.800
Because this is silly.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.056
The general contractor selects experts

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.816
because it takes years

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.576
to learn and master

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.376
how to do each of the tasks it takes
to build a house or renovate a kitchen,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.680
some of them requiring special training.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.256
Think about it:

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.720
Would you want your architect
to install your toilet?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.736
Of course not.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.600
So let's apply this process
to the corporate world.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.776
Companies today focus on manufacturing

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.136
what they produce best
and most efficiently,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.000
and they trade for everything else.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.376
So this means they rely

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.376
on a global, interconnected,
interdependent network of manufacturers

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.656
to produce these products.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.736
In fact, that network is so interconnected

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.000
it's almost impossible

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.440
to dismantle and produce
products in just one country.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.416
Let's take a look
at the interconnected web

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.096
we saw a few moments ago,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.416
and let's focus on just one strand

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.520
between the US and Mexico.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.456
The Wilson Institute says
that shared production represents

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.560
40 percent of the half a trillion dollars
in trade between the US and Mexico.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.736
That's about 200 billion dollars,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.720
or the same as the GDP for Portugal.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.256
So let's just imagine

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.376
that the US decides to impose

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.120
a 20 percent border tax
on all imports from Mexico.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.056
OK, fine.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.440
But do you think Mexico is just
going to stand by and let that happen?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.816
No. No way.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.896
So in retaliation,
they impose a similar tax

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.760
on all goods being imported from the US,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.880
and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.656
and 20 percent -- just imagine
that 20 percent duties

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.176
are added to every good,
product, product component

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.896
crossing back and forth across the border,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.256
and you could be looking at more
than a 40 percent increase in duties,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.040
or 80 billion dollars.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.576
Now, don't kid yourself,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.896
these costs are going to be passed along

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.160
to you and to me.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.216
Now, let's think about what impact
that might have on some of the products,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.960
or the prices of the products,
that we buy every day.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.016
So if a 30 percent increase in duties
were actually passed along,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.680
we would be looking at some
pretty important increases in prices.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.440
A Lincoln MKZ would go
from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.120
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.016
would go from 898 dollars
to 1,167 dollars.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.176
And the price of a 16-ounce jar
of CVS skin moisturizer

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.640
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.616
Now, remember, this is only looking
at one strand of the production chain

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.016
between the US and Mexico,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.840
so multiply this out
across all of the strands.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.256
The impact could be considerable.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.936
Now, just think about this:

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.200
even if we were able
to dismantle this network

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.696
and produce products in just one country,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.216
which by the way is easier said than done,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.656
we would still only
be saving or protecting

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.576
one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.640
That's right, because remember,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.056
most of those jobs, 87 percent,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.760
were lost due to improvements
in our own productivity.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.680
And unfortunately,
those jobs, they're gone for good.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.720
So the real question is,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.856
does it make sense for us
to drive up prices

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.400
to the point where many of us can't afford
the basic goods we use every day

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.496
for the purpose of saving a job

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.000
that might be eliminated
in a couple of years anyway?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.056
The reality is that shared production

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.736
allows us to manufacture
higher quality products

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.976
at lower costs.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.200
It's that simple.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.816
It allows us to get more

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.256
out of the limited resources
and expertise we have

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.480
and at the same time
benefit from lower prices.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.616
It's really important to remember

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.456
that for shared production
to be effective,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.896
it relies on efficient cross-border
movement of raw materials,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.880
components and finished products.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.160
So remember this:

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.176
the next time you're hearing somebody
try to sell you on the idea

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.520
that protectionism is a good deal,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.016
it's just not.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.256
Thank you.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.040
(Applause)
