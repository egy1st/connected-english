WEBVTT

00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:03.416
Where does the end begin?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.680
Well, for me, it all began
with this little fellow.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.656
This adorable organism --

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.136
well, I think it's adorable --

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.176
is called Tetrahymena
and it's a single-celled creature.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.096
It's also been known as pond scum.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.840
So that's right, my career
started with pond scum.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.736
Now, it was no surprise
I became a scientist.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.856
Growing up far away from here,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.776
as a little girl I was deadly curious

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.776
about everything alive.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.440
I used to pick up lethally poisonous
stinging jellyfish and sing to them.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.616
And so starting my career,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.016
I was deadly curious
about fundamental mysteries

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.376
of the most basic building blocks of life,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.096
and I was fortunate to live in a society
where that curiosity was valued.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.696
Now, for me, this little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.016
was a great way to study
the fundamental mystery

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.096
I was most curious about:

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.495
those bundles of DNA
in our cells called chromosomes.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.936
And it was because I was curious
about the very ends of chromosomes,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.976
known as telomeres.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.696
Now, when I started my quest,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.616
all we knew was that they helped
protect the ends of chromosomes.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.336
It was important when cells divide.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.736
It was really important,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.856
but I wanted to find out
what telomeres consisted of,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.656
and for that, I needed a lot of them.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.256
And it so happens
that cute little Tetrahymena

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.296
has a lot of short linear chromosomes,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.936
around 20,000,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.320
so lots of telomeres.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.896
And I discovered that telomeres
consisted of special segments

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.616
of noncoding DNA right
at the very ends of chromosomes.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.816
But here's a problem.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.656
Now, we all start life as a single cell.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.416
It multiples to two.
Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.656
and on and on to form
the 200 million billion cells

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320
that make up our adult body.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.840
And some of those cells
have to divide thousands of times.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.496
In fact, even as I stand here before you,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.616
all throughout my body,
cells are furiously replenishing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160
to, well, keep me
standing here before you.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.496
So every time a cell divides,
all of its DNA has to be copied,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.136
all of the coding DNA
inside of those chromosomes,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.696
because that carries
the vital operating instructions

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.736
that keep our cells in good working order,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.416
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.656
which I assure you
they're not doing right now,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.576
and my immune cells

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.496
can fight off bacteria and viruses,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.376
and our brain cells
can save the memory of our first kiss

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.880
and keep on learning throughout life.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.336
But there is a glitch
in the way DNA is copied.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.216
It is just one of those facts of life.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.616
Every time the cell divides
and the DNA is copied,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.656
some of that DNA from the ends
gets worn down and shortened,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.976
some of that telomere DNA.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.176
And think about it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.656
like the protective caps
at the ends of your shoelace.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.216
And those keep the shoelace,
or the chromosome, from fraying,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.576
and when that tip
gets too short, it falls off,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.280
and that worn down telomere
sends a signal to the cells.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.536
"The DNA is no longer being protected."

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.576
It sends a signal. Time to die.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.056
So, end of story.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.960
Well, sorry, not so fast.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.736
It can't be the end of the story,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.256
because life hasn't died
off the face of the earth.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.896
So I was curious:

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.016
if such wear and tear is inevitable,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.256
how on earth does Mother Nature make sure

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.720
we can keep our chromosomes intact?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.240
Now, remember that little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.640
The craziest thing was,
Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Their telomeres weren't shortening
as time marched on.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.096
Sometimes they even got longer.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.016
Something else was at work,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.000
and believe me, that something
was not in any textbook.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.936
So working in my lab with
my extraordinary student Carol Greider --

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.560
and Carol and I shared
the Nobel Prize for this work --

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.360
we began running experiments

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.200
and we discovered
cells do have something else.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.936
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.496
that could replenish,
make longer, telomeres,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.320
and we named it telomerase.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.456
And when we removed
our pond scum's telomerase,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.920
their telomeres ran down and they died.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.296
So it was thanks
to their plentiful telomerase

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.800
that our pond scum critters never got old.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.320
OK, now, that's
an incredibly hopeful message

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.400
for us humans to be
receiving from pond scum,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.656
because it turns out

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.496
that as we humans age,
our telomeres do shorten,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.536
and remarkably,
that shortening is aging us.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.736
Generally speaking,
the longer your telomeres,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.000
the better off you are.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.376
It's the overshortening of telomeres

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.800
that leads us to feel and see
signs of aging.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.296
My skin cells start to die

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.176
and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.040
Hair pigment cells die.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.000
You start to see gray.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.360
Immune system cells die.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.856
You increase your risks of getting sick.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.496
In fact, the cumulative research
from the last 20 years

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.696
has made clear that telomere attrition

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.256
is contributing to our risks
of getting cardiovascular diseases,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.096
Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.840
the very conditions many of us die of.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.000
And so we have to think about this.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.296
What is going on?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.056
This attrition,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.056
we look and we feel older, yeah.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.616
Our telomeres are losing
the war of attrition faster.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.096
And those of us who feel youthful longer,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.776
it turns out our telomeres
are staying longer

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.096
for longer periods of time,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.896
extending our feelings of youthfulness

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.416
and reducing the risks
of all we most dread

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.480
as the birthdays go by.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.696
OK,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.880
seems like a no-brainer.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.296
Now, if my telomeres are connected

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.896
to how quickly
I'm going to feel and get old,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.376
if my telomeres can be
renewed by my telomerase,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.896
then all I have to do to reverse
the signs and symptoms of aging

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.456
is figure out where to buy
that Costco-sized bottle

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.656
of grade A organic
fair trade telomerase, right?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.336
Great! Problem solved.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.376
(Applause)

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.296
Not so fast, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.776
Alas, that's not the case.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.056
OK. And why?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.416
It's because human genetics has taught us

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.536
that when it comes to our telomerase,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.976
we humans live on a knife edge.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.240
OK, simply put,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.536
yes, nudging up telomerase
does decrease the risks of some diseases,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.616
but it also increases the risks
of certain and rather nasty cancers.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.416
So even if you could buy
that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.176
and there are many websites
marketing such dubious products,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.760
the problem is you could
nudge up your risks of cancers.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
And we don't want that.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.136
Now, don't worry,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.056
and because, while I think
it's kind of funny that right now,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.740
you know, many of us may be thinking,
"Well, I'd rather be like pond scum," ...

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.840
(Laughter)

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.216
there is something for us humans

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.816
in the story of telomeres
and their maintenance.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.496
But I want to get one thing clear.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.696
It isn't about enormously
extending human lifespan

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.736
or immortality.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.656
It's about health span.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.376
Now, health span is the number
of years of your life

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.176
when you're free of disease,
you're healthy, you're productive,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.336
you're zestfully enjoying life.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.056
Disease span, the opposite of health span,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.816
is the time of your life
spent feeling old and sick and dying.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.416
So the real question becomes,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.200
OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.096
do I have control
over my telomeres' length

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.856
and hence my well-being, my health,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.480
without those downsides of cancer risks?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.816
OK?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.576
So, it's the year 2000.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.816
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing
little teeny tiny telomeres

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.256
very happily for many years,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.096
when into my lab walks
a psychologist named Elissa Epel.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.816
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects
of severe, chronic psychological stress

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.760
on our mind's and our body's health.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.216
And there she was standing in my lab,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.296
which ironically overlooked
the entrance to a mortuary, and --

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.656
(Laughter)

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.336
And she had a life-and-death
question for me.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.016
"What happens to telomeres
in people who are chronically stressed?"

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.256
she asked me.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.416
You see, she'd been studying caregivers,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.976
and specifically mothers of children
with a chronic condition,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.536
be it gut disorder,
be it autism, you name it --

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.760
a group obviously under enormous
and prolonged psychological stress.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.056
I have to say, her question

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.096
changed me profoundly.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.856
See, all this time
I had been thinking of telomeres

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.176
as those miniscule
molecular structures that they are,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.520
and the genes that control telomeres.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.936
And when Elissa asked me
about studying caregivers,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.440
I suddenly saw telomeres
in a whole new light.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.296
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.256
into the lives of the real people
we were studying.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.496
And I'm a mom myself,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.456
and at that moment,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.296
I was struck by the image of these women

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.440
dealing with a child with a condition

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.200
very difficult to deal with,
often without help.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.096
And such women, simply,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.910
often look worn down.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.696
So was it possible their telomeres
were worn down as well?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.376
So our collective curiosity
went into overdrive.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.296
Elissa selected for our first study
a group of such caregiving mothers,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.496
and we wanted to ask:
What's the length of their telomeres

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.096
compared with the number of years
that they have been caregiving

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.896
for their child with a chronic condition?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.696
So four years go by

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.856
and the day comes
when all the results are in,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.576
and Elissa looked down
at our first scatterplot

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120
and literally gasped,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.576
because there was a pattern to the data,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.016
and it was the exact gradient
that we most feared might exist.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.976
It was right there on the page.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.416
The longer, the more years that is,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.336
the mother had been
in this caregiving situation,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.056
no matter her age,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.056
the shorter were her telomeres.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.176
And the more she perceived

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.856
her situation as being more stressful,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.240
the lower was her telomerase
and the shorter were her telomeres.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.856
So we had discovered something unheard of:

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.736
the more chronic stress you are under,
the shorter your telomeres,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.416
meaning the more likely you were
to fall victim to an early disease span

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.160
and perhaps untimely death.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.336
Our findings meant
that people's life events

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.296
and the way we respond to these events

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.400
can change how you
maintain your telomeres.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.800
So telomere length wasn't
just a matter of age counted in years.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.936
Elissa's question to me,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.880
back when she first came to my lab,
indeed had been a life-and-death question.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.056
Now, luckily, hidden
in that data there was hope.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.696
We noticed that some mothers,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.856
despite having been carefully caring
for their children for many years,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.480
had been able to maintain their telomeres.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.936
So studying these women closely revealed
that they were resilient to stress.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.616
Somehow they were able
to experience their circumstances

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.136
not as a threat day in and day out

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.816
but as a challenge,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.896
and this has led to a very important
insight for all of us:

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.696
we have control over the way we age

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.240
all the way down into our cells.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.096
OK, now our initial curiosity
became infectious.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.696
Thousands of scientists
from different fields

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.216
added their expertise
to telomere research,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.160
and the findings have poured in.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.840
It's up to over 10,000
scientific papers and counting.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.336
So several studies
rapidly confirmed our initial finding

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.120
that yes, chronic stress
is bad for telomeres.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.096
And now many are revealing

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.016
that we have more control
over this particular aging process

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.856
than any of us could ever have imagined.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.096
A few examples:

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.256
a study from the University
of California, Los Angeles

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.696
of people who are caring
for a relative with dementia, long-term,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.176
and looked at their caregiver's
telomere maintenance capacity

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.416
and found that it was improved

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.256
by them practicing a form of meditation

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.160
for as little as 12 minutes
a day for two months.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.376
Attitude matters.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.776
If you're habitually a negative thinker,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.536
you typically see a stressful situation
with a threat stress response,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.016
meaning if your boss wants to see you,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.376
you automatically think,
"I'm about to be fired,"

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.976
and your blood vessels constrict,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.336
and your level of the stress
hormone cortisol creeps up,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.896
and then it stays up,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.856
and over time, that persistently
high level of the cortisol

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.776
actually damps down your telomerase.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.560
Not good for your telomeres.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.456
On the other hand,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:09.456
if you typically see something stressful
as a challenge to be tackled,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.936
then blood flows to your heart
and to your brain,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.656
and you experience a brief
but energizing spike of cortisol.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.216
And thanks to that habitual
"bring it on" attitude,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.280
your telomeres do just fine.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.800
So ...

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.000
What is all of this telling us?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.416
Your telomeres do just fine.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.416
You really do have power
to change what is happening

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.800
to your own telomeres.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.520
But our curiosity
just got more and more intense,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.936
because we started to wonder,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.176
what about factors outside our own skin?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.120
Could they impact
our telomere maintenance as well?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.136
You know, we humans
are intensely social beings.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160
Was it even possible
that our telomeres were social as well?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.160
And the results have been startling.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.080
As early as childhood,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.536
emotional neglect, exposure to violence,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.576
bullying and racism

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.040
all impact your telomeres,
and the effects are long-term.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.096
Can you imagine the impact on children

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.040
of living years in a war zone?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.096
People who can't trust their neighbors

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.256
and who don't feel safe
in their neighborhoods

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.360
consistently have shorter telomeres.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.576
So your home address
matters for telomeres as well.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.800
On the flip side,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.496
tight-knit communities,
being in a marriage long-term,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.456
and lifelong friendships, even,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.400
all improve telomere maintenance.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.816
So what is all this telling us?

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.336
It's telling us that I have the power
to impact my own telomeres,

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.656
and I also have the power to impact yours.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.480
Telomere science has told us
just how interconnected we all are.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.720
But I'm still curious.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.160
I do wonder

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.400
what legacy all of us

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.319
will leave for the next generation?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.536
Will we invest

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.576
in the next young woman or man

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.816
peering through a microscope
at the next little critter,

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.496
the next bit of pond scum,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.296
curious about a question
we don't even know today is a question?

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.216
It could be a great question
that could impact all the world.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.920
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.336
Now that you know
how to protect your telomeres,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.265
are you curious what are you going to do

00:17:56.289 --> 00:17:58.769
with all those decades
of brimming good health?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.080
And now that you know you could impact
the telomeres of others,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.240
are you curious

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.000
how will you make a difference?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.976
And now that you know the power
of curiosity to change the world,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.216
how will you make sure
that the world invests in curiosity

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.800
for the sake of the generations
that will come after us?

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.776
Thank you.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.200
(Applause)
