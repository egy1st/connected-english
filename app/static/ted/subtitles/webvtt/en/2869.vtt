00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.576
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.816
Mars is a very cold planet,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.096
flooded with high levels of UV radiation

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.016
and extremely dry.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.160
In fact, Mars is considered
to be too dry for life as we know it.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.176
I'm an astrobiologist.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.096
I try to understand
the origin of life on Earth

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.336
and the possibilities of finding life

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.600
elsewhere in the universe.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.656
People sometimes ask me,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.856
how can you be an astrobiologist

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.680
if you don't have your own spaceship?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.856
Well, what I do is that I study life

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.856
in those environments on Earth

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.200
that most closely resemble
other interesting places in the universe.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.576
All life on Earth requires water,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.136
so in my case I focus
on the intimate relationship

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.656
between water and life

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.256
in order to understand

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520
if we could find life
in a planet as dry as Mars.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.976
But since I do not have
the 2.5 billion dollars

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.216
to send my own robot to Mars,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.176
I study the most Martian place on Earth,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.736
the Atacama Desert.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.416
Located in northern Chile,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.056
it is the oldest
and driest desert on Earth.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.056
To give you an idea of how dry it is,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.120
consider here in Vancouver it rains
over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.496
In the Atacama, there are places
with no reported rains

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.320
in the last 400 years.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.576
How do I know this?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.096
Well, because I was born
and raised in the Atacama --

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.736
(Laughter)

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.776
So I had a unique advantage

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.840
when I started studying this desert.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.416
So let me tell you guys
a few fantastic examples

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.096
he has found

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.320
on how life has adapted
to live with almost no water at all.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.216
One of my first findings
was in the entrance of a cave

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.976
facing the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.696
In this place, we reported
a new type of microalgae

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.640
that grew only on top of the spiderwebs
that covered the cave entrance.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.760
Have you ever seen a spiderweb
early in the morning?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.776
It's covered with dew,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.056
so this microalgae learned
that in order to carry photosynthesis

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.096
in the coast of the driest
desert on Earth,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.616
they could use the spiderwebs.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.056
So here they may access
the water from the fogs

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320
that regularly cover
these areas in the morning.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.480
In another cave, we found
a different type of microalgae.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.336
This one is able to use ocean mist
as a source of water,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.496
and strikingly lives
in the very bottom of a cave,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.736
so it has adapted to live
with less than 0.1 percent

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880
of the amount of light
that regular plants need.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.016
These type of findings
suggest to me that on Mars,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.896
we may find even
photosynthetic life inside caves.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.296
And by the way, that's me.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.136
(Laughter)

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.896
Now, for almost 15 years
this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.936
was thought to be
the driest place of this desert,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.696
but I knew that it was not.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.096
How? You already know the answer.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.336
Because I was born
and raised in this desert.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.016
So I remembered that I
usually see fogs in Yungay,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.256
so after setting sensors
in a number of places,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.336
where I remember
never seeing fogs or clouds,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.376
I reported four other sites
much drier than Yungay,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.016
with this one, MarÃ­a Elena South,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.496
being the truly driest place on Earth,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.496
as dry as Mars,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.856
and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.160
from the small mining town
where I was born.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.416
Now, in this search, we were trying
to actually find the dry limit

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.656
for life on Earth,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.536
a place so dry that nothing
was able to survive in it.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.136
But even here, well hidden underground,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.576
we found a number
of different microorganisms,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.056
which suggested to me
that similarly dry places, like Mars,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.280
may be inhabited.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.656
We even have some preliminary evidences

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.216
that these microorganisms
may still be active

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.176
in the desiccated state,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.016
like walking mummies all around us,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.160
and that they may be using
UV radiation as a source of energy.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.456
If confirmed, this would have
a huge impact on our definition of life,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.000
on how we look for life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.776
Due to its clear skies, by 2020,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.456
60 percent of the biggest
telescopes on Earth

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.696
will be located in the Atacama,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.616
and while everyone else
will be looking among the stars

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.880
to answer the question, "Are we alone?"

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.696
I will be looking down to the ground

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.296
searching for this same answer

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.520
in my own backyard.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.176
Thank you.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.360
(Applause)
