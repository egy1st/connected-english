00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:02.770
In my early days as a graduate student,

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:06.349
I went on a snorkeling trip
off the coast of the Bahamas.

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.738
I'd actually never swum
in the ocean before,

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.606
so it was a bit terrifying.

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:15.016
What I remember the most is,
as I put my head in the water

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.290
and I was trying really hard
to breathe through the snorkel,

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:24.680
this huge group
of striped yellow and black fish

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.187
came straight at me ...

00:00:26.817 --> 00:00:28.214
and I just froze.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.588
And then, as if it had
suddenly changed its mind,

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.049
came towards me
and then swerved to the right

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:36.588
and went right around me.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.446
It was absolutely mesmerizing.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.652
Maybe many of you
have had this experience.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.661
Of course, there's the color
and the beauty of it,

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.613
but there was also
just the sheer oneness of it,

00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:49.980
as if it wasn't hundreds of fish

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.139
but a single entity
with a single collective mind

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:54.670
that was making decisions.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.348
When I look back, I think that experience
really ended up determining

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.594
what I've worked on for most of my career.

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:05.437
I'm a computer scientist,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.208
and the field that I work in
is artificial intelligence.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.156
And a key theme in AI

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.623
is being able to understand intelligence
by creating our own computational systems

00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:17.900
that display intelligence
the way we see it in nature.

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:22.905
Now, most popular views of AI, of course,
come from science fiction and the movies,

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.506
and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.390
But that tends to be a very human-centric
view of intelligence.

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:33.351
When you think of a fish school,

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.328
or when I think of a flock of starlings,

00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:39.692
that feels like a really different
kind of intelligence.

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:44.858
For starters, any one fish is just so tiny

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.769
compared to the sheer size
of the collective,

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:50.903
so it seems that any one individual

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.920
would have a really limited
and myopic view of what's going on,

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:56.278
and intelligence
isn't really about the individual

00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:58.979
but somehow a property
of the group itself.

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:03.349
Secondly, and the thing
that I still find most remarkable,

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:08.405
is that we know that there are no leaders
supervising this fish school.

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.664
Instead, this incredible
collective mind behavior

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:17.220
is emerging purely from the interactions
of one fish and another.

00:02:17.244 --> 00:02:21.212
Somehow, there are these interactions
or rules of engagement

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:22.991
between neighboring fish

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.482
that make it all work out.

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:28.387
So the question for AI then becomes,

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.569
what are those rules of engagement
that lead to this kind of intelligence,

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.500
and of course, can we create our own?

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.586
And that's the primary thing
that I work on with my team in my lab.

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:40.580
We work on it through theory,

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:42.952
looking at abstract rule systems

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.325
and thinking about
the mathematics behind it.

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:50.182
We also do it through biology,
working closely with experimentalists.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.532
But mostly, we do it through robotics,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:56.460
where we try to create
our own collective systems

00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:59.191
that can do the kinds of things
that we see in nature,

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:00.452
or at least try to.

00:03:01.907 --> 00:03:04.711
One of our first robotic quests
along this line

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:08.780
was to create our very own colony
of a thousand robots.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.474
So very simple robots,

00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:14.101
but they could be programmed
to exhibit collective intelligence,

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.854
and that's what we were able to do.

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:18.226
So this is what a single robot looks like.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.773
It's quite small,
about the size of a quarter,

00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:23.107
and you can program how it moves,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:26.547
but it can also wirelessly
communicate with other robots,

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:28.738
and it can measure distances from them.

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:32.238
And so now we can start to program
exactly an interaction,

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.356
a rule of engagement between neighbors.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:36.607
And once we have this system,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:40.047
we can start to program many
different kinds of rules of engagement

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:41.577
that you would see in nature.

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:44.577
So for example,
spontaneous synchronization,

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:49.839
how audiences are clapping
and suddenly start all clapping together,

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.931
the fireflies flashing together.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.610
We can program rules
for pattern formation,

00:03:57.634 --> 00:03:59.420
how cells in a tissue

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.546
determine what role
they're going to take on

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.276
and set the patterns of our bodies.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.134
We can program rules for migration,

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.135
and in this way, we're really learning
from nature's rules.

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.242
But we can also take it a step further.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:16.258
We can actually take these rules
that we've learned from nature

00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:20.076
and combine them and create
entirely new collective behaviors

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.298
of our very own.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.438
So for example,

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.814
imagine that you had
two different kinds of rules.

00:04:26.374 --> 00:04:28.493
So your first rule is a motion rule

00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:32.858
where a moving robot can move
around other stationary robots.

00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:34.693
And your second rule is a pattern rule

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:37.874
where a robot takes on a color
based on its two nearest neighbors.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.124
So if I start with a blob of robots
in a little pattern seed,

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.054
it turns out that these two rules
are sufficient for the group

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:47.830
to be able to self-assemble
a simple line pattern.

00:04:49.114 --> 00:04:51.658
And if I have more
complicated pattern rules,

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:53.999
and I design error correction rules,

00:04:54.023 --> 00:04:57.120
we can actually create really,
really complicated self assemblies,

00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:58.788
and here's what that looks like.

00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:02.859
So here, you're going to see
a thousand robots

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:06.345
that are working together
to self-assemble the letter K.

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:07.675
The K is on its side.

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:10.954
And the important thing
is that no one is in charge.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:15.803
So any single robot is only talking
to a small number of robots nearby it,

00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:19.764
and it's using its motion rule
to move around the half-built structure

00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.795
just looking for a place to fit in
based on its pattern rules.

00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:28.192
And even though no robot
is doing anything perfectly,

00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:31.876
the rules are such that we can get
the collective to do its goal

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.373
robustly together.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.015
And the illusion becomes
almost so perfect, you know --

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.455
you just start to not even notice
that they're individual robots at all,

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.162
and it becomes a single entity,

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:43.907
kind of like the school of fish.

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:50.752
So these are robots and rules
in two dimensions,

00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:54.087
but we can also think about robots
and rules in three dimensions.

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:57.714
So what if we could create robots
that could build together?

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.831
And here, we can take inspiration
from social insects.

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.849
So if you think about
mound-building termites

00:06:04.873 --> 00:06:06.925
or you think about army ants,

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.202
they create incredible,
complex nest structures out of mud

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:13.370
and even out of their own bodies.

00:06:14.602 --> 00:06:16.822
And like the system I showed you before,

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:19.816
these insects actually
also have pattern rules

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.878
that help them determine what to build,

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:24.204
but the pattern can be made
out of other insects,

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:26.015
or it could be made out of mud.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:31.539
And we can use that same idea
to create rules for robots.

00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:35.382
So here, you're going to see
some simulated robots.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:37.889
So the simulated robot has a motion rule,

00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:40.246
which is how it traverses
through the structure,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.267
looking for a place to fit in,

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.291
and it has pattern rules
where it looks at groups of blocks

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:47.520
to decide whether to place a block.

00:06:48.644 --> 00:06:51.707
And with the right motion rules
and the right pattern rules,

00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:55.366
we can actually get the robots
to build whatever we want.

00:06:56.197 --> 00:06:58.888
And of course, everybody wants
their own tower.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.332
(Laughter)

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.684
So once we have these rules,

00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:06.874
we can start to create the robot bodies
that go with these rules.

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:10.207
So here, you see a robot
that can climb over blocks,

00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:12.912
but it can also lift and move these blocks

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:15.633
and it can start to edit
the very structure that it's on.

00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:17.765
But with these rules,

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.268
this is really only one kind of robot body
that you could imagine.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:23.871
You could imagine
many different kinds of robot bodies.

00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:28.505
So if you think about robots
that maybe could move sandbags

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:31.078
and could help build levees,

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:35.403
or we could think of robots
that built out of soft materials

00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:39.071
and worked together
to shore up a collapsed building --

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:42.093
so just the same kind of rules
in different kinds of bodies.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.433
Or if, like my group, you are completely
obsessed with army ants,

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:52.831
then maybe one day we can make robots
that can climb over literally anything

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:55.029
including other members of their tribe,

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:57.402
and self-assemble things
out of their own bodies.

00:07:58.137 --> 00:07:59.818
Once you understand the rules,

00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:03.221
just many different kinds
of robot visions become possible.

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:09.026
And coming back to the snorkeling trip,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.395
we actually understand a great deal
about the rules that fish schools use.

00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:17.605
So if we can invent
the bodies to go with that,

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:19.057
then maybe there is a future

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:23.603
where I and my group will get to snorkel
with a fish school of our own creation.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.979
Each of these systems that I showed you

00:08:31.003 --> 00:08:35.280
brings us closer to having
the mathematical and the conceptual tools

00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:38.685
to create our own versions
of collective power,

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.710
and this can enable many different kinds
of future applications,

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:44.898
whether you think about robots
that build flood barriers

00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:49.219
or you think about robotic bee colonies
that could pollinate crops

00:08:49.243 --> 00:08:52.767
or underwater schools of robots
that monitor coral reefs,

00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.894
or if we reach for the stars
and we thinking about programming

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.537
constellations of satellites.

00:08:58.148 --> 00:08:59.760
In each of these systems,

00:08:59.784 --> 00:09:03.331
being able to understand
how to design the rules of engagement

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.869
and being able to create
good collective behavior

00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:08.267
becomes a key to realizing these visions.

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:14.849
So, so far I've talked about
rules for insects and for fish

00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:17.242
and for robots,

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:20.369
but what about the rules that apply
to our own human collective?

00:09:20.866 --> 00:09:23.296
And the last thought
that I'd like to leave you with

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.001
is that science is of course itself

00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:28.509
an incredible manifestation
of collective intelligence,

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.851
but unlike the beautiful
fish schools that I study,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:35.818
I feel we still have a much longer
evolutionary path to walk.

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:41.350
So in addition to working on improving
the science of robot collectives,

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.651
I also work on creating robots
and thinking about rules

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:47.135
that will improve
our own scientific collective.

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:49.866
There's this saying that I love:

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.294
who does science
determines what science gets done.

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:57.180
Imagine a society

00:09:57.204 --> 00:09:58.855
where we had rules of engagement

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:02.182
where every child grew up believing
that they could stand here

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:04.628
and be a technologist of the future,

00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:06.153
or where every adult

00:10:06.177 --> 00:10:10.296
believed that they had the ability
not just to understand but to change

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.875
how science and technology
impacts their everyday lives.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.719
What would that society look like?

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:19.894
I believe that we can do that.

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:22.209
I believe that we can choose our rules,

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.990
and we engineer not just robots

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:26.610
but we can engineer
our own human collective,

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:30.468
and if we do and when we do,
it will be beautiful.

00:10:30.492 --> 00:10:31.643
Thank you.

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:38.214
