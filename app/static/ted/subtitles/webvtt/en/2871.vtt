00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:03.520
Today I'm here, actually,
to pose you a question.

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:05.206
What is life?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.403
It has been really puzzling me
for more than 25 years,

00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:13.009
and will probably continue doing so
for the next 25 years.

00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:18.345
This is the thesis I did
when I was still in undergraduate school.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:26.377
While my colleagues still treated
computers as big calculators,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.702
I started to teach computers to learn.

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.944
I built digital lady beetles

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:37.555
and tried to learn from real lady beetles,
just to do one thing:

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.729
search for food.

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:42.095
And after very simple neural network --

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:44.390
genetic algorithms and so on --

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:45.771
look at the pattern.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.817
They're almost identical to real life.

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:53.865
A very striking learning experience
for a twenty-year-old.

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:58.510
Life is a learning program.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.792
When you look
at all of this wonderful world,

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:07.008
every species has
its own learning program.

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:10.346
The learning program is genome,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.974
and the code of that program is DNA.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:21.134
The different genomes of each species
represent different survival strategies.

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:25.832
They represent hundreds of millions
of years of evolution.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.671
The interaction between
every species' ancestor

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:32.665
and the environment.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.589
I was really fascinated about the world,

00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:37.795
about the DNA,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.762
about, you know, the language of life,

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.432
the program of learning.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:47.500
So I decided to co-found
the institute to read them.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.886
I read many of them.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:53.718
We probably read more than half
of the prior animal genomes in the world.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.719
I mean, up to date.

00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:58.678
We did learn a lot.

00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:03.165
We did sequence, also,
one species many, many times ...

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.348
human genome.

00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:06.134
We sequenced the first Asian.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.996
I sequenced it myself many, many times,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.579
just to take advantage of that platform.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:15.874
Look at all those repeating base pairs:

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:17.366
ATCG.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.304
You don't understand anything there.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.922
But look at that one base pair.

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.469
Those five letters, the AGGAA.

00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:27.361
These five SNPs represent
a very specific haplotype

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:29.226
in the Tibetan population

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.249
around the gene called EPAS1.

00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:33.004
That gene has been proved --

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.291
it's highly selective --

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:38.662
it's the most significant signature
of positive selection of Tibetans

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.368
for the higher altitude adaptation.

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:42.316
You know what?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.127
These five SNPs were the result
of integration of Denisovans,

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.403
or Denisovan-like individuals into humans.

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.760
This is the reason
why we need to read those genomes.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.165
To understand history,

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.287
to understand what kind
of learning process

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.685
the genome has been through
for the millions of years.

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:08.421
By reading a genome,
it can give you a lot of information --

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:10.118
tells you the bugs in the genome --

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.322
I mean, birth defects,
monogenetic disorders.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.652
Reading a drop of blood

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:16.784
could tell you why you got a fever,

00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:19.912
or it tells you which medicine
and dosage needs to be used

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:22.657
when you're sick, especially for cancer.

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.795
A lot of things could be studied,
but look at that:

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.779
30 years ago, we were still poor in China.

00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:34.770
Only .67 percent of the Chinese
adult population had diabetes.

00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:37.330
Look at now: 11 percent.

00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:41.005
Genetics cannot change over 30 years --

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.290
only one generation.

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.532
It must be something different.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:45.754
Diet?

00:03:45.778 --> 00:03:46.928
The environment?

00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:48.702
Lifestyle?

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.641
Even identical twins
could develop totally differently.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.936
It could be one becomes
very obese, the other is not.

00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:01.536
One develops a cancer
and the other does not.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.465
Not mentioning living
in a very stressed environment.

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:10.161
I moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.923
for some reason, people may know.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.908
If the gene's under stress,

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:17.599
it behaves totally differently.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.244
Life is a journey.

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:23.325
A gene is just a starting point,

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.499
not the end.

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:29.774
You have this statistical risk
of certain diseases when you are born.

00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:33.955
But every day you make different choices,

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.517
and those choices will increase
or decrease the risk of certain diseases.

00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:41.687
But do you know
where you are on the curve?

00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:44.602
What's the past curve look like?

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.424
What kind of decisions
are you facing every day?

00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:50.228
And what kind of decision is the right one

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:54.486
to make your own right curve
over your life journey?

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:56.595
What's that?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.289
The only thing you cannot change,

00:04:59.313 --> 00:05:01.494
you cannot reverse back,

00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:02.746
is time.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.771
Probably not yet; maybe in the future.

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:05.905
(Laughter)

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:08.748
Well, you cannot change
the decision you've made,

00:05:08.772 --> 00:05:10.313
but can we do something there?

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:15.745
Can we actually try to run
multiple options on me,

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:19.328
and try to predict right
on the consequence,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.535
and be able to make the right choice?

00:05:22.153 --> 00:05:23.325
After all,

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.201
we are our choices.

00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:28.987
These lady beetles came to me afterwards.

00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:33.105
25 years ago, I made
the digital lady beetles

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.913
to try to simulate real lady beetles.

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:37.288
Can I make a digital me ...

00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:39.221
to simulate me?

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:42.516
I understand the neural
network could become

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.626
much more sophisticated
and complicated there.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.204
Can I make that one,

00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:51.110
and try to run multiple options
on that digital me --

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:52.394
to compute that?

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:55.988
Then I could live in different universes,

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:58.776
in parallel, at the same time.

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:01.661
Then I would choose
whatever is good for me.

00:06:02.243 --> 00:06:06.085
I probably have the most comprehensive
digital me on the planet.

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.766
I've spent a lot of dollars
on me, on myself.

00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:15.193
And the digital me told me
I have a genetic risk of gout

00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:16.884
by all of those things there.

00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:19.365
You need different technology to do that.

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.959
You need the proteins, genes,

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:23.509
you need metabolized antibodies,

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:26.025
you need to screen all your body

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:29.673
about the bacterias and viruses
covering you, or in you.

00:06:29.697 --> 00:06:32.485
You need to have
all the smart devices there --

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.925
smart cars, smart house, smart tables,

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.278
smart watch, smart phone
to track all of your activities there.

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:40.779
The environment is important --

00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:42.024
everything's important --

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:43.794
and don't forget the smart toilet.

00:06:43.818 --> 00:06:44.849
(Laughter)

00:06:44.873 --> 00:06:46.647
It's such a waste, right?

00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:52.356
Every day, so much invaluable information
just has been flushed into the water.

00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:54.032
And you need them.

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:55.580
You need to measure all of them.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:58.227
You need to be able to measure
everything around you

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.468
and compute them.

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:03.996
And the digital me told me
I have a genetic defect.

00:07:04.797 --> 00:07:06.868
I have a very high risk of gout.

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:09.465
I don't feel anything now,

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:10.861
I'm still healthy.

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:12.386
But look at my uric acid level.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.225
It's double the normal range.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.740
And the digital me searched
all the medicine books,

00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:21.932
and it tells me, "OK, you could
drink burdock tea" --

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:23.654
I cannot even pronounce it right --

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:24.713
(Laughter)

00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:26.551
That is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:29.835
And I drank that tea for three months.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:32.400
My uric acid has now gone back to normal.

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:34.793
I mean, it worked for me.

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:37.333
All those thousands of years
of wisdom worked for me.

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:38.507
I was lucky.

00:07:38.864 --> 00:07:42.372
But I'm probably not lucky for you.

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:45.354
All of this existing
knowledge in the world

00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:51.202
cannot possibly be efficient enough
or personalized enough for yourself.

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:54.527
The only way to make
that digital me work ...

00:07:55.424 --> 00:07:57.481
is to learn from yourself.

00:07:59.093 --> 00:08:01.497
You have to ask a lot
of questions about yourself:

00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:03.194
"What if?" --

00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:05.021
I'm being jet-lagged now here.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.003
You don't probably see it, but I do.

00:08:08.073 --> 00:08:09.865
What if I eat less?

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.837
When I took metformin,
supposedly to live longer?

00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:14.921
What if I climb Mt. Everest?

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.247
It's not that easy.

00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:17.601
Or run a marathon?

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:20.446
What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.806
which is a Chinese liquor,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.024
and I get really drunk?

00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:27.477
I was doing a video rehearsal last time
with the folks here,

00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:28.770
when I was drunk,

00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:30.883
and I totally delivered
a different speech.

00:08:30.907 --> 00:08:33.776
(Laughter)

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.101
What if I work less, right?

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.007
I have been less stressed, right?

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:39.841
So that probably never happened to me,

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:41.963
I was really stressed every day,

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.953
but I hope I could be less stressed.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.470
These early studies told us,

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.477
even with the same banana,

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.488
we have totally different
glucose-level reactions

00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:52.898
over different individuals.

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:54.072
How about me?

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.414
What is the right breakfast for me?

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:59.356
I need to do two weeks
of controlled experiments,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.125
of testing all kinds of different
food ingredients on me,

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:05.437
and check my body's reaction.

00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.578
And I don't know
the precise nutrition for me,

00:09:08.602 --> 00:09:09.752
for myself.

00:09:11.193 --> 00:09:15.557
Then I wanted to search
all the Chinese old wisdom

00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:18.573
about how I can live longer,
and healthier.

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:20.117
I did it.

00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:22.392
Some of them are really unachievable.

00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:25.607
I did this once last October,

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.349
by not eating for seven days.

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:32.273
I did a fast for seven days
with six partners of mine.

00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:34.037
Look at those people.

00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:35.212
One smile.

00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:36.387
You know why he smiled?

00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:37.578
He cheated.

00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:38.602
(Laughter)

00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:41.762
He drank one cup of coffee at night,

00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:43.271
and we caught it from the data.

00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:44.340
(Laughter)

00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:46.824
We measured everything from the data.

00:09:46.848 --> 00:09:49.062
We were able to track them,

00:09:49.086 --> 00:09:50.644
and we could really see --

00:09:50.668 --> 00:09:52.669
for example, my immune system,

00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:54.455
just to give you a little hint there.

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:58.783
My immune system changed
dramatically over 24 hours there.

00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:03.051
And my antibody regulates my proteins

00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:04.611
for that dramatic change.

00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:06.016
And everybody was doing that.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.372
Even if we're essentially
totally different at the very beginning.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:12.441
And that probably will be
an interesting treatment in the future

00:10:12.465 --> 00:10:14.108
for cancer and things like that.

00:10:14.132 --> 00:10:15.762
It becomes very, very interesting.

00:10:16.286 --> 00:10:18.987
But something you probably
don't want to try,

00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.687
like drinking fecal water
from a healthier individual,

00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:24.378
which will make you feel healthier.

00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:26.117
This is from old Chinese wisdom.

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:27.577
Look at that, right?

00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.767
Like 1,700 years ago,

00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.071
it's already there, in the book.

00:10:32.608 --> 00:10:33.935
But I still hate the smell.

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:35.387
(Laughter)

00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:37.817
I want to find out the true way to do it,

00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:42.195
maybe find a combination of cocktails
of bacterias and drink it,

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:43.743
it probably will make me better.

00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:44.958
So I'm trying to do that.

00:10:44.982 --> 00:10:47.984
Even though I'm trying this hard,

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:53.034
it's so difficult to test out
all possible conditions.

00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:58.295
It's not possible to do
all kinds of experiments at all ...

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:03.154
but we do have seven billion
learning programs on this planet.

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:04.444
Seven billion.

00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:08.119
And every program
is running in different conditions

00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:09.924
and doing different experiments.

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:11.799
Can we all measure them?

00:11:12.962 --> 00:11:16.177
Seven years ago,
I wrote an essay in "Science"

00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.493
to celebrate the human genome's
10-year anniversary.

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:21.829
I said, "Sequence yourself,

00:11:21.853 --> 00:11:23.476
for one and for all."

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:25.666
But now I'm going to say,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.436
"Digitalize yourself for one and for all."

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:35.875
When we make this digital me
into a digital we,

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:39.651
when we try to form an internet of life,

00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:42.536
when people can learn from each other,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.267
when people can learn
from their experience,

00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:47.022
their data,

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:50.647
when people can really form
a digital me by themselves

00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:52.282
and we learn from it,

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:59.148
the digital we will be
totally different with a digital me.

00:11:59.172 --> 00:12:02.592
But it can only come from the digital me.

00:12:04.103 --> 00:12:07.082
And this is what I try to propose here.

00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:09.271
Join me --

00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:11.094
become we,

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:16.730
and everybody should build up
their own digital me,

00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:21.273
because only by that
will you learn more about you,

00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:22.721
about me,

00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:23.910
about us ...

00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:28.358
about the question I just posed
at the very beginning:

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:29.532
"What is life?"

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:31.235
Thank you.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:37.209
(Applause)

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:39.994
Chris Anderson:
One quick question for you.

00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:42.792
I mean, the work is amazing.

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:46.014
I suspect one question people have is,

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:49.319
as we look forward to these amazing
technical possibilities

00:12:49.343 --> 00:12:50.704
of personalized medicine,

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:54.031
in the near-term it feels like
they're only going to be affordable

00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:55.331
for a few people, right?

00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:58.346
It costs many dollars to do
all the sequencing and so forth.

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:01.801
Is this going to lead to a kind of,

00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:04.142
you know, increasing inequality?

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:08.077
Or do you have this vision
that the knowledge that you get

00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:09.453
from the pioneers

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:11.573
can actually be
pretty quickly disseminated

00:13:11.597 --> 00:13:15.721
to help a broader set of recipients?

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:17.279
Jun Wang: Well, good question.

00:13:17.303 --> 00:13:20.854
I'll tell you that seven years ago,
when I co-founded BGI,

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:24.283
and served as the CEO
of the company there,

00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:26.688
the only goal there for me to do

00:13:26.712 --> 00:13:28.695
was to drive the sequencing cost down.

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.819
It started from 100 million dollars
per human genome.

00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:34.434
Now, it's a couple hundred dollars
for a human genome.

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:38.072
The only reason to do it
is to get more people to benefit from it.

00:13:38.378 --> 00:13:40.535
So for the digital me,
it's the same thing.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.048
Now, you probably need,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:45.301
you know, one million dollars
to digitize a person.

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:47.476
I think it has to be 100 dollars.

00:13:47.987 --> 00:13:52.036
It has to be free for many of those people
that urgently need that.

00:13:52.372 --> 00:13:53.639
So this is our goal.

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:57.416
And it seems that with all
this merging of the technology,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.032
I'm thinking that in the very near future,

00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:02.421
let's say three to five years,

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:03.927
it will come to reality.

00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:07.930
And this is the whole idea
of why I founded iCarbonX,

00:14:07.954 --> 00:14:09.173
my second company.

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:12.065
It's really trying to get the cost down

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:15.509
to a level where every individual
could have the benefit.

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:18.581
CA: All right, so the dream is not
elite health services for few,

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:19.839
it's to really try

00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:22.974
and actually make overall health care
much more cost effective --

00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:25.428
JW: But we started
from some early adopters,

00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:27.958
people believing ideas and so on,

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:31.624
but eventually, it will become
everybody's benefit.

00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:34.636
CA: Well, Jun, I think
it's got to be true to say

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.618
you're one of the most amazing
scientific minds on the planet,

00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:39.071
and it's an honor to have you.

00:14:39.095 --> 00:14:40.253
JW: Thank you.

00:14:40.277 --> 00:14:41.427
(Applause)
