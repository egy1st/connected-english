00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.911
Back home, my friends call me nicknames,

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:06.168
such as "The Giant Clam Girl,"

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:07.475
"Clam Queen,"

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.735
or, "The Mother of Clams."

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.110
(Laughter)

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.389
This is because every time I see them,

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.674
I talk nonstop about giant clams all day,

00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:17.975
every day.

00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:22.776
Giant clams are these massive
and colorful shelled marine animals,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.448
the largest of its kind.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.673
Just look at this shell.

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.493
The biggest recorded individual
was four-and-a-half-feet long

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:33.891
and weighed about 550 pounds.

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:37.172
That is almost as heavy
as three baby elephants.

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:42.863
South Pacific legends once described
giant clams as man-eaters

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:46.888
that would lie in wait on the seabed
to trap unsuspecting divers.

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.569
A story goes that a diver
had lost his legs

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:53.508
while trying to retrieve a pearl
from a giant clam.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.490
I thought, "Really?"

00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:58.102
So out of curiosity,

00:00:58.126 --> 00:01:00.773
I did an experiment using myself as bait.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.548
(Laughter)

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.849
I carefully placed my hand
into the clam's mouth and waited.

00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:08.511
Hmm ...

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.935
I still have my hand.

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.631
It seems that these gentle giants
would rather retreat

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.236
and protect their fleshy bodies

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.471
than feed on me.

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:18.877
So much for those killer clam myths!

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.650
Unfortunately, the reality is,

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:25.301
we are the giant clams' biggest threat.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:30.221
Considered a delicacy throughout
the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.056
giant clams have been traditionally
fished as seafood.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:37.334
Fishermen are particularly interested
in their adductor muscles,

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.887
which are organs that hold
the two shells together like a hinge.

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.128
Just for their muscles,

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.491
giant clams were almost
hunted to extinction

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.180
between the 1960s and 1980s.

00:01:49.217 --> 00:01:52.737
Clamshells are also popular
in the ornamental trade

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:54.727
as jewelry and for display.

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.037
In the South China Sea,

00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.963
fishermen went out of their way
to collect fossilized clamshells

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.592
by digging through large areas
of coral reefs.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:09.346
These were later carved and sold
as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:13.601
Giant clams, dead or alive,
are not safe from us.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:14.977
It's a "clamity!"

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:19.817
(Laughter)

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:24.733
(Applause)

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:29.399
With the spotlight on more
charismatic marine animals

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:31.589
such as the whales and coral reefs,

00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:35.313
it is easy to forget that other
marine life needs our help, too.

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:40.651
My fascination with giant clams
got me started on conservation research

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:43.918
to fill in the knowledge gaps
on their ecology and behavior.

00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:47.864
One of the discoveries that we made
was that giant clams could walk

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:49.293
across the seafloor.

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:51.874
Yes, you heard me right:

00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:53.099
they can walk.

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:54.728
To find out,

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:56.985
we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.907
Now watch what happens over 24 hours.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:08.834
We think that walking is important
for getting away from predators

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:10.846
and finding mates for breeding.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.923
While it can hard to imagine
any movement in these enormous animals,

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:18.431
giant clams up to 400 pounds
can still walk,

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.163
they just move slower.

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:25.915
During my PhD, I discovered
more secrets about the giant clams.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.164
But there was something
missing in my work.

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:31.952
I found myself asking,

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:35.435
"Why should people care
about conserving giant clams?" --

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.308
other than myself, of course.

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.794
(Laughter)

00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:48.055
It turns out that giant clams
have a giant impact on coral reefs.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.853
These multitasking clams
are reef builders,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:53.652
food factories,

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:56.023
shelters for shrimps and crabs

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:57.249
and water filters,

00:03:57.273 --> 00:03:58.624
all rolled into one.

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.543
In a nutshell,

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:02.936
giant clams play a major contributing role

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.287
as residents of their own reef home,

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.414
and just having them around
keeps the reef healthy.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.291
And because they can live
up to 100 years old,

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:15.685
giant clams make vital indicators
of coral reef health.

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:19.313
So when giant clams
start to disappear from coral reefs,

00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:21.954
their absence can serve as an alarm bell

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:24.262
for scientists to start paying attention,

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:26.537
similar to the canary in a coal mine.

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:29.081
But giant clams are endangered.

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:33.341
The largest clam in the world
is facing the threat of extinction,

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:37.895
with more than 50 percent
of the wild population severely depleted.

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:42.407
And the ecological benefits
of having giant clams on coral reefs

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.942
are likely to continue
only if populations are healthy,

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.303
making their conservation paramount.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.597
So I stand here today to give a voice
to the giant clams,

00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.628
because I care a whole lot
for these amazing animals,

00:04:56.652 --> 00:04:58.770
and they deserve to be cared for.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:03.159
It is time for the giant clams
to step out of their shells,

00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:07.330
and show the world that they, too,
can be the heroes of the oceans.

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:08.569
Thank you very much.

00:05:08.593 --> 00:05:12.746
(Applause)
