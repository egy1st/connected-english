00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:05.190
Cities are like siblings
in a large polygamous family.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:10.752
Each one has a unique personality
and is headed in a distinct direction.

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.625
But they all have somewhat shared origins.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:17.724
Sometimes I think postcolonial cities
are like the children

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:19.447
of the two least-favorite wives,

00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.055
who are constantly being asked,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.282
"Ah, why can't you be
more like your sister?"

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:24.916
(Laughter)

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.892
The "why" of cities is largely the same,
no matter where they are:

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:34.612
an advantageous location that makes
trade and administration possible;

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.828
the potential for scalable opportunities

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:39.229
for the skilled and unskilled alike;

00:00:39.253 --> 00:00:42.272
a popular willingness
to be in constant flux

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:44.049
and, of course, resilience.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.598
The "how" of cities, however,
is a whole other story.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:49.878
How are they run?

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:51.695
How do they grow?

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.597
How do they decide who belongs
and who doesn't?

00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:57.529
Lagos is my home.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.211
You can always find the Nigerians

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.465
by following the noise
and the dancing, right?

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.625
(Laughter)

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.489
Like any major city,
that place is a lot of things,

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:09.812
many of which are highly contradictory.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.646
Our public transportation
doesn't quite work,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.825
so we have these privately owned
bright yellow buses

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.884
that regularly cause accidents.

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:23.082
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained
and often flooded roads.

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:26.557
Street evangelism is only
slightly less ubiquitous

00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:28.045
than street harassment.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.927
Sex workers sometimes
have two degrees, a bank job

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.759
and a prominent role in church.

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:34.787
(Laughter)

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:35.973
On any given day,

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:39.326
there can be either a party
or a burned body

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.745
in the middle of a street.

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:45.505
There is so much that is possible in Lagos

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:46.719
and so much that isn't,

00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:49.956
and very often the difference
between possibility and impossibility

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.594
is simply who you are,

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:54.137
and if you're lucky enough,
who you're connected to.

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:57.041
Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept

00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:01.193
determined by ethnic origin,
sexual orientation, gender,

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:04.552
but most visibly and often most violently,

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:05.885
class.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.093
Before Nigeria became a country,

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:13.028
fisherpeople from the inland creeks
started to come down the Lagos lagoon

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:15.426
and establish villages along the coast.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.454
About 60 years later, my grandfather,
Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:22.000
also arrived in Lagos.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:26.083
Like me, he was an alumnus
of the University of Ibadan,

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.642
a young member of the educated elite
in the independence era.

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:33.855
Over time, he built an illustrious career
as a land surveyor,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.945
mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.211
when they were just waist-high wild grass.

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:40.759
He died when I was nine.

00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:44.570
And by that time, my family,
like the families of those fisherpeople,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.140
knew Lagos as home.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.364
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:52.858
"Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,"

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:56.597
which can be translated to mean
that Lagos will welcome anyone.

00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:59.956
But that saying is becoming
less and less true.

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:04.109
Many Lagosians, including
the descendants of those fisherpeople

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.485
who arrived generations
before my grandfather,

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.223
are now being pushed out

00:03:08.247 --> 00:03:09.950
to make room for an emergent city

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:12.569
that has been described
as "the new Dubai."

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:17.607
You see, Lagos inspires big dreams,
even in its leaders,

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:20.315
and successive governments
have declared aspirations

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.142
towards a megacity
where poverty does not exist.

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:27.766
Unfortunately, instead of focusing
on the eradication of poverty

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.293
as you would expect,

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:32.850
the strategy of choice focuses
on eliminating the poor.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.375
Last October, the Governor announced plans

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.923
to demolish every single
waterfront settlement in Lagos.

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:44.438
There are more than 40
of these indigenous communities

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:45.624
all over the city,

00:03:45.648 --> 00:03:47.764
with over 300,000 people living in them.

00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:50.427
Otodo Gbame,

00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:52.417
a hundred-year-old fishing village

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.375
with a population about
three-quarters that of Monaco

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.036
and similar potential
for beachfront luxury --

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.093
(Laughter)

00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:01.082
was one of the first to be targeted.

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:06.071
I first heard of Otodo Gbame
after the demolition started.

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:10.977
When I visited in November 2016,
I met Magdalene Aiyefoju.

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:13.739
She is a now-homeless woman

00:04:13.763 --> 00:04:16.098
whose surname means, "the world is blind."

00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.412
Magdalene's son Basil
was one of over 20 people

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:23.261
who were shot, drowned

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:25.429
or presumed dead in that land grab.

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.141
Standing outside her shelter,
I saw the two white-sand football fields

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:32.655
where Basil used to play.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.289
Spread all around us were the ruins
of schools, churches,

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:39.433
a primary health center, shops,

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:40.999
thousands of homes.

00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:45.381
Young children enthusiastically helped
to put up shelters,

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.460
and about 5,000 of the residents,
with nowhere else to go,

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:49.907
simply stayed put.

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:52.256
And then in April,

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.066
state security personnel came back.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.710
This time, they cleared
the community out completely,

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.555
with beatings, bullets and fire.

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:08.453
As I speak, there are construction crews
preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.665
for anyone who can afford
a multi-million-dollar view.

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:15.063
The new development
is called "Periwinkle Estate."

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:23.279
Forced evictions are incredibly violent
and, of course, unconstitutional.

00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:26.596
And yet, they happen so often
in so many of our cities,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.365
because the first thing we are taught
to forget about poor people

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.812
is that they are people.

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:35.975
We believe that a home is a thing
a person absolutely has a right to,

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.973
unless the person is poor
and the home is built a certain way

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:40.346
in a certain neighborhood.

00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.329
But there is no single definition
of the word "home."

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.691
After all, what is a slum
besides an organic response

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.801
to acute housing deficits
and income inequality?

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.994
And what is a shanty if not a person
making a home for themselves

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:57.584
against all odds?

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:01.707
Slums are an imperfect housing solution,

00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.424
but they are also prime examples
of the innovation, adaptability

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.174
and resilience at the foundation --

00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:09.585
and the heart --

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.274
of every functional city.

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:14.834
You don't need to be the new Dubai

00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:16.428
when you're already Lagos.

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:23.538
(Applause)

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.997
We have our own identity,

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.721
our own rhythm,

00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:31.040
and as anyone who knows
Lagos can tell you,

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:34.600
poor Lagosians are very often
the source of the city's character.

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.857
Without its poor, Lagos would not
be known for its music

00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:39.159
or its endless energy

00:06:39.183 --> 00:06:42.832
or even the fact that you can buy
an ice cold drink or a puppy

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:44.259
through your car window.

00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:46.891
(Laughter)

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.820
The conditions that cause us
to define certain neighborhoods as slums

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.815
can be effectively improved,

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.902
but not without recognizing
the humanity and the agency

00:06:56.926 --> 00:06:58.466
of the people living in them.

00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:02.218
In Lagos, where public goods
are rarely publicly available,

00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:05.844
slum dwellers are often at the forefront
of innovating solutions.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.102
After being disconnected
from the grid for months

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:12.391
because the power company
couldn't figure out how to collect bills,

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:15.876
one settlement designed a system
that collectivized remittances

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.529
and got everyone cheaper rates
into the bargain.

00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:21.814
Another settlement created
a reform program

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.592
that hires local bad boys as security.

00:07:24.616 --> 00:07:26.742
They know every trick and every hideout,

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.196
so now troublemakers are more likely
to get caught and reported to police

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.547
and fewer of the youth end up
engaging in criminal activity.

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:36.433
Yet another settlement recently completed

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:39.571
a flood-safe, eco-friendly
communal toilet system.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:43.166
Models like these are being
adopted across Lagos.

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:47.873
Informal settlements are incorrectly
named as the problem.

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:51.979
In fact, the real problems
are the factors that create them,

00:07:52.003 --> 00:07:53.936
like the entrenchment of poverty,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.155
social exclusion

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:56.606
and state failures.

00:07:57.386 --> 00:08:00.008
When our governments
frame slums as threats

00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.922
in order to justify violent land grabs
or forced evictions,

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.911
they're counting on those of us
who live in formal housing

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:09.733
to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:12.653
Rather, we must remind them

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:15.298
that governments exist to serve
not only those who build

00:08:15.322 --> 00:08:16.825
and live in luxury homes,

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.226
but also those who clean and guard them.

00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:21.382
Our --

00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:24.768
(Applause)

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.017
our realities may differ,

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.023
but our rights don't.

00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:33.794
The Lagos state government,

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.741
like far too many on our continent,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.438
pays lip service to ideas of inclusion,

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:41.509
while acting as though
progress can only be achieved

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:44.965
by the erasure, exploitation
and even elimination of groups

00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:46.748
it considers expendable.

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:51.375
People living with disabilities
who hawk or beg on Lagos streets

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.594
are rounded up, extorted

00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:54.831
and detained.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.573
Women in low-income
neighborhoods are picked up

00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.092
and charged with prostitution,

00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:02.000
regardless of what they actually
do for a living.

00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:06.543
Gay citizens are scapegoated
to distract from real political problems.

00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:11.535
But people, like cities, are resilient,

00:09:12.092 --> 00:09:15.497
and no amount of legislation
or intimidation or violence

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.456
can fully eliminate any of us.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.946
Prostitutes, women
and women who work as prostitutes

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.481
still haven't gone extinct,

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:26.161
despite centuries of active suppression.

00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:29.525
Queer Africans continue to exist,

00:09:29.549 --> 00:09:33.334
even though queerness is now criminalized
in most parts of the continent.

00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:37.907
And I'm fairly certain that poor people
don't generally tend to just disappear

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:40.658
because they've been stripped
of everything they have.

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:44.872
We are all already here,

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:47.135
and that answers the question

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.964
of whether or not we belong.

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:54.878
When those fisherpeople
started to sail down the lagoon

00:09:54.902 --> 00:09:56.337
in search of new homes,

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.424
it could not have occurred to them

00:09:58.448 --> 00:10:00.572
that the city that would
rise up around them

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:03.325
would one day insist
that they do not belong in it.

00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:07.017
I like to believe that my grandfather,

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:08.906
in mapping new frontiers for Lagos,

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.841
was trying to open it up

00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:13.879
to make room for other people
to be welcomed by the city

00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:15.562
in the same way that he was.

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:19.573
On my way here, my grandma called me

00:10:19.597 --> 00:10:22.334
to remind me how proud she was,

00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:25.350
how proud [my grandfather]
and my mother would have been.

00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:28.312
I am their dreams come true.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:34.457
But there is no reason why their dreams --
or mine, for that matter --

00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:35.853
are allowed to come true

00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:38.311
while those of others
are turned to nightmares.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.817
And lest we forget:

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:43.583
the minimum requirement for a dream

00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:46.492
is a safe place to lay your head.

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:51.795
It is too late now for Basil,

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:54.444
but not for Magdalene,

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.407
not for the hundreds of thousands,

00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:58.825
the millions still under threat in Lagos

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:00.567
or any of our cities.

00:11:01.368 --> 00:11:04.194
The world does not have to remain blind

00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:08.647
to the suffering that is created
when we deny people's humanity,

00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:11.961
or even to the incredible potential
for growth that exists

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:16.006
when we recognize and value
all contributions.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:19.994
We must hold our governments

00:11:20.018 --> 00:11:21.723
and ourselves

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.167
accountable

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:26.899
for keeping our shared cities safe
for everyone in them,

00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:30.281
because the only cities worth building --

00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:34.263
indeed, the only futures
worth dreaming of --

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:36.320
are those that include all of us,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.262
no matter who we are

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:41.613
or how we make homes for ourselves.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:43.647
Thank you.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:48.365
(Applause)
