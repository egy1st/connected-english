00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:05.737
So, I teach college students
about inequality and race in education,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.826
and I like to leave my office open
to any of my students

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.381
who might just want to see me to chat.

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:12.952
And a few semesters ago,

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:15.881
one of my more cheerful
students, Mahari,

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:17.302
actually came to see me

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:21.977
and mentioned that he was feeling
a bit like an outcast because he's black.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.874
He had just transferred to NYU
from a community college

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:26.660
on a merit scholarship,

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:28.518
and turns out,

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:31.824
only about five percent
of students at NYU are black.

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.277
And so I started to remember

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.830
that I know that feeling
of being an outsider

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:37.534
in your own community.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.777
It's partially what drew me to my work.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.032
At my university,

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:43.453
I'm one of the few
faculty members of color,

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:47.302
and growing up, I experienced
my family's social mobility,

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:50.549
moving out of apartments
into a nice house,

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:52.928
but in an overwhelmingly
white neighborhood.

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:54.443
I was 12,

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.419
and kids would say that were surprised
that I didn't smell like curry.

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.666
(Laughter)

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.635
That's because school is in the morning,

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.531
and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:04.705
(Laughter)

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:06.413
Curry is for dinner.

00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:07.888
(Laughter)

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:09.793
So when Mahari was leaving,

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:12.809
I asked him how he was coping
with feeling isolated.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.058
And he said that despite feeling lonely,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.158
he just threw himself at his work,

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.635
that he built strategies around his grit

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.566
and his desire to be successful.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.850
A mentor of mine is actually
Dr. Angela Duckworth,

00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:29.741
the psychologist at UPenn who has defined
this stick-to-itiveness of grit

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.445
as being "the perseverance
and passion for long-term goals."

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.646
Angela's book has become a bestseller,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.681
and schools across the country,

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.420
particularly charter schools,

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:42.911
have become interested in citing
"grit" as a core value.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.306
But sometimes grit isn't enough,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.230
especially in education.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:49.122
So when Mahari was leaving my office,

00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:51.824
I worried that he might need
something more specific

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:54.165
to combat the challenges
that he mentioned to me.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.029
As a sociologist,
I also study achievement,

00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:00.232
but from a slightly different perspective.

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:03.429
I research students who have overcome
immense obstacles

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:05.077
related to their background.

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.733
Students from low-income,

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:08.794
often single-parent households,

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:13.655
students who have been homeless,
incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.108
or some who have struggled
with substance abuse

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:18.624
or lived through violent or sexual trauma.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.328
So let me tell you about two
of the grittiest people I've met.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:25.751
Tyrique was raised by a single mother,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.629
and then after high school,
he fell in with the wrong crowd.

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:30.545
He got arrested for armed robbery.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.027
But in prison, he started to work hard.

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:34.877
He took college credit courses,

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:37.547
so when he got out,
he was able to get a master's,

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.929
and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.

00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:43.462
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:46.853
from the Lower East Side
to Staten Island to the Bronx.

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:49.848
She was raised primarily
by her extended family,

00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:52.342
because her own mother
had a heroin addiction.

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:53.962
Yet at 15,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:55.606
Vanessa had to drop out of school,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.013
and she had a son of her own.

00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:00.803
But eventually, she was able
to go to community college,

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:02.322
get her associate's,

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:05.598
then go to an elite college
to finish her bachelor's.

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.785
So some people might
hear these stories and say,

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.818
"Yes, those two definitely have grit.

00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.706
They basically pulled themselves up
by the bootstraps."

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.488
But that's an incomplete picture,

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.033
because what's more important

00:03:18.057 --> 00:03:22.158
is that they had factors in their lives
that helped to influence their agency,

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:23.858
or their specific capacity

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:27.446
to actually overcome
the obstacles that they were facing

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.842
and navigate the system
given their circumstances.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:32.652
So, allow me to elaborate.

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:36.298
In prison, Tyrique
was actually aimless at first,

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:38.381
as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:42.219
This is until an older detainee
took him aside

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:44.784
and asked him to help
with the youth program.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.251
And in mentoring youth,

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:49.861
he started to see his own mistakes
and possibilities in the teens.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:53.939
This is what got him interested
in taking college-credit courses.

00:03:53.963 --> 00:03:55.143
And when he got out,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.381
he got a job with Fortune Society,

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.105
where many executives are people
who have been formerly incarcerated.

00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:04.210
So then he was able to get
a master's in social work,

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:08.669
and today, he even lectures
at Columbia about prison reform.

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.549
And Vanessa ...

00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:12.637
well, after the birth of her son,

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.941
she happened to find a program
called Vocational Foundation

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.981
that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.163
a MetroCard

00:04:19.187 --> 00:04:21.373
and her first experiences with a computer.

00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:24.741
These simple resources
are what helped her get her GED,

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.620
but then she suffered
from a very serious kidney failure,

00:04:27.644 --> 00:04:31.708
which was particularly problematic
because she was only born with one kidney.

00:04:31.732 --> 00:04:35.858
She spent 10 years on dialysis
waiting for a successful transplant.

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:37.728
After that,

00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:40.574
her mentors at community college
had kept in touch with her,

00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:42.235
and so she was able to go,

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.358
and they put her in an honors program.

00:04:44.382 --> 00:04:47.123
And that's the pathway
that allowed her to become accepted

00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:50.486
to one of the most elite colleges
for women in the country,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.987
and she received her bachelor's at 36,

00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.787
setting an incredible example
for her young son.

00:04:56.782 --> 00:05:00.971
What these stories primarily indicate
is that teaching is social

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:03.360
and benefits from social scaffolding.

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:06.194
There were factors
pushing these two in one direction,

00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.067
but through tailored
mentorship and opportunities,

00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:11.615
they were able to reflect
on their circumstances

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.151
and resist negative influences.

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.685
They also learned simple skills
like developing a network,

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:19.350
or asking for help --

00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:24.178
things many of us in this room can forget
that we have needed from time to time,

00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:25.699
or can take for granted.

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.083
And when we think of people like this,

00:05:28.107 --> 00:05:32.282
we should only think of them
as exceptional, but not as exceptions.

00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:35.477
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.925
of the collective responsibility
to help students in similar situations.

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:43.878
When Presidents Bush, Obama
and now even Trump,

00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.600
have called education
"the civil rights issue of our time,"

00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:49.354
perhaps we should treat it that way.

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:53.831
If schools were able to think
about the agency that their students have

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:56.348
and bring to the table
when they push them,

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:59.371
what students learn can become
more relevant to their lives,

00:05:59.395 --> 00:06:03.966
and then they can tap into those internal
reservoirs of grit and character.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.629
So this here --

00:06:06.653 --> 00:06:08.368
My student Mahari

00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:11.617
got accepted to law school
with scholarships,

00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:13.157
and not to brag,

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.704
but I did write one of his letters
of recommendation.

00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.316
(Laughter)

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.298
And even though I know hard work
is what got him this achievement,

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.429
I've seen him find
his voice along the way,

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:27.294
which as someone who's grown up
a little bit shy and awkward,

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:29.631
I know it takes time and support.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:32.790
So even though
he will rely a lot on his grit

00:06:32.814 --> 00:06:35.989
to get him through
that first-year law school grind,

00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:38.418
I'll be there as a mentor for him,

00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:40.474
check in with him from time to time,

00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:42.482
maybe take him out to get some curry ...

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:43.593
(Laughter)

00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:47.368
so that he can keep growing his agency
to succeed even more.

00:06:47.392 --> 00:06:48.543
Thank you.

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:52.201
(Applause)
