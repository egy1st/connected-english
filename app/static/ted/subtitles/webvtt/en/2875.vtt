WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.896
I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.936
and through a combination
of accidents and cosmic justice,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.856
became a chef in the US.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.656
(Laughter)

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.280
When I first arrived in New York,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.576
I began working in these restaurants --
different types of restaurants --

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.296
from French bistro to Italian,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240
global ethnic to modern American.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.536
At the time,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.280
New York was already well-established
as a food capital of the world.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.280
However ...

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.536
with the exception of a few West African
and Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.440
there was no such thing
as African cuisine in the entire city.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.256
Early in my life,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.256
I was influenced
by Senegal's first president,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.880
Léopold Sédar Senghor,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.216
nicknamed, "the poet president,"

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.576
who talked about a new humanism,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.976
a universal civilization,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.016
in which all cultures would come together
around a communal table as equals,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.440
each bringing its own beautiful
contribution to share.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.040
He called it "the rendezvous
of giving and receiving."

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.496
That concept resonated with me,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.440
and it has guided my career path.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.576
After years of working in restaurants,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.736
I yearned for my work
to have a deeper impact

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.160
that would go beyond
the last meal I had served.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.536
I wanted to give back, both to New York --

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.616
the city that allowed me
the opportunity to follow my calling --

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.320
but also to my origins
and ancestors in Senegal.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.576
I wanted to contribute
to that universal civilization

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.120
Senghor had described.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.456
But I didn't know how to make
a measurable impact

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
as a cook and writer.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.976
While I was writing my first cookbook,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.520
I often traveled to different regions
of Senegal for research.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.696
During one of those trips,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.560
in the remote, southeast
region of Kédougou

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.800
I rediscovered
an ancient grain called fonio

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.120
that had all but disappeared
from the urban Senegalese diet.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.536
It turns out that fonio
had been cultivated

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.136
for more than five thousand years

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.920
and is probably the oldest
cultivated cereal in Africa.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.160
Once a popular grain
on much of the continent,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.880
fonio was grown
all the way to ancient Egypt,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.920
where archaeologists found grains
inside pyramids' burial grounds.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.616
Today it is mostly cultivated
in the western part of the Sahel region,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.936
from Senegal to Mali,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.256
Burkina Faso,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.720
Togo, Nigeria.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.936
The Sahel region is that semiarid area
south of the Sahara desert

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.280
that extends from the Atlantic
in the west to the Red Sea in the east.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.256
I became more interested in this grain

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.360
that was deemed worth taking
to the afterlife by early Egyptians.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.256
As I continued my research,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.136
I found out that fonio was actually --

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.136
wherever it was cultivated --

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.800
there was always some myth,
or some superstition connected to it.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.216
The Dogon,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.096
another great culture in Mali,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.776
called it "po,"

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.440
or, "the seed of the universe."

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.816
In that ancient culture's mythology,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.600
the entire universe
sprouted from a seed of fonio.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.456
Aside from its purported
mystical properties,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.000
fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.056
It is nutritious,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.856
particularly rich
in methionine and cysteine,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.256
two amino acids that are deficient
in most other major grains:

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.320
barley, rice or wheat to name a few.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.816
In addition,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.040
fonio cultivation
is great for the environment.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.776
It tolerates poor soil

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.536
and needs very little water,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.760
surviving where nothing else will grow.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.136
As a chef,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.080
what first struck me was
its delicate taste and its versatility.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.480
Similar to couscous,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.960
fonio has a delicious,
nutty and earthy flavor.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.376
It can be turned into salad,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.496
served as noodles,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.136
used in baking

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.856
or simply as a substitute for any
other grains in your favorite recipes.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.256
I am happy to share some of my
fonio sushi and sweet potato sushi

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.640
with some of you right now.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.296
(Audience) Oh!

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.816
(Applause)

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.040
And okra.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.600
(Audience murmurs)

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.296
In Kédougou

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.480
it is also nicknamed "ñamu buur,"

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.136
which means "food for royalty,"

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.400
and it's served for guests of honor.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.840
Located at the border
with Guinea and Mali,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.056
Kédougou first strikes visitors
with its stunning vistas

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.360
and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.360
Sadly, it is also one of the poorest
regions of Senegal.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.136
Because of desertification
and lack of job prospects,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.200
much of Kédougou's
young population has left.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.176
They chose the deadly path of migration

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.640
in search of "better" opportunities.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.120
Often,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.960
they risk their lives
trying to reach Europe.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.600
Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.936
Others end up on inadequate wooden canoes

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.480
in desperate attempts to reach Spain.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.896
According to a recent "Guardian" article,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.736
by 2020 more that 60 million people
from sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.096
are expected to migrate

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.056
due to desertification.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.936
This is the biggest global wave
of migration since the Second World War,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.720
and it's only set to grow.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.440
So far this year,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.256
more that 2,100 migrants
have lost their lives

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.880
on their way to Europe.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.056
This is the reality of Kédougou

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.040
and of much of the Sahel today.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.376
Scary future,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.176
scarce food

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.320
and no opportunities
to change their situation.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.080
If life in your village
weren't so precarious,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.816
if there was a way
to having enough food to get by,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.320
or having a paying job --

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.136
if you and your sisters

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.496
didn't have to spend
30 percent of their waking hours

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.840
fetching water,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.880
if conditions were just
a little more hospitable ...

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.800
could the solution
be right here in our soil?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.176
Could bringing fonio
to the rest of the world

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.400
be the answer?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.656
Ancient grains are getting more popular,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.456
and sales of gluten-free items
are growing in the US --

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.696
16.4 percent since 2013,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.880
making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.440
How could fonio
partake in this market share?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.520
There are many challenges
in turning fonio into food.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.816
Traditional processing
is laborious and time-consuming,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.080
especially when compared to other grains.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.720
Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.136
And there are now machines

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.776
that can process fonio
in a more efficient way.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.176
And as a matter of fact,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.816
a few years ago,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.296
Sanoussi Diakité,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.576
a Senegalese engineer,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.816
won a Rolex prize

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.440
for his invention of the first
mechanized fonio processor.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.655
Today, such machines are making life
much easier for producers

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.360
around the whole Sahel region.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.096
Another challenge
is the colonial mentality

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.840
that what comes from the west is best.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.376
This tendency to look down
on our own products

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.736
and to see crops like fonio
as simply "country peoples' food,"

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.616
therefore substandard,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.776
explains why even though we don't
produce wheat in Senegal traditionally,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.256
it is far easier to find baguettes
or croissants in the streets of Dakar

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.440
than it is to find any fonio products.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.376
This same mindset popularized
the overprocessed, leftover rice debris

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.320
known as "broken rice,"

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.656
which was imported to Senegal
from Indochina

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.040
and introduced by the colonial French.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.336
Soon, broken rice became
a key ingredient in our national dish,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.616
thiéboudienne,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.096
replacing our own traditional,
more nutritious African rice,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.360
Oryza glaberrima.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.976
Ironically, the same African rice
despised at home

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.416
was hailed abroad.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.456
Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.040
this rice became
a major crop in the Americas ...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.096
particularly in the Carolinas

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.640
where it was nicknamed, "Carolina gold."

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.120
But let's return to fonio.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.336
How can we turn its current status
of "country-people food"

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.360
into a world-class crop?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.136
Last year,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.576
a business partner and I secured
a commitment from Whole Foods Market,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.976
the US's largest natural food store chain,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
to carry fonio.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.896
And we got a large
American ingredient importer

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.936
interested enough
to send a team of executives

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.776
to West Africa with us

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.280
to explore the supply chain's viability.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.336
We found ourselves
observing manual operations

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.696
in remote locations

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.680
with few controls over quality.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.760
So we started focusing
on processing issues.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.656
We drew up a vision

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.456
with a beneficial and commercially
sustainable supply chain for fonio,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.336
and we connected ourselves
with organizations

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.960
that can help us achieve it.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.265
Walking backwards from the market,
here is what it looks like.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.896
Imagine that fonio
is consumed all across the globe

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.560
as other popular ancient grains.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.376
Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.016
breads,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.240
nutrition bars,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.096
cookies, pastas,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.760
snacks -- why not?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.576
It's easier to say than quinoa.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.920
(Laughter)

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.840
(Applause)

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.576
To get there,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.016
fonio needs to be readily available

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.776
at a consistent quality
for commercial users,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.616
such as food manufacturers
and restaurant chains.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.120
That's the part we're missing.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.096
To make fonio available
at a consistent quality

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.856
for commercial use,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.296
you need a commercial-scale fonio mill

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.640
that adheres to international
quality standards.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.216
Currently, there is no such mill
in the whole world,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.896
so in our vision,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.456
there is an African-owned
and operated fonio mill

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.976
that processes efficiently

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.360
and in compliance with the requirements
of multinational food companies.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.656
It is very difficult
for the fonio producers today

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.216
to sell and use fonio

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.096
unless they devote
a huge amount of time and energy

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.416
in threshing, winnowing and husking it.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.736
In our vision,

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.456
the mill will take on those tasks,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.360
allowing the producers to focus
on farming rather than processing.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.840
There is untapped
agricultural capacity in the Sahel,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.040
and all it takes
is changing market conditions

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.880
to activate that capacity.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.856
By relieving fonio producers
of manual operations,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.176
the mill will free up their time

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.360
and remove the production bottleneck
that limits their output.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.496
And there are other benefits as well

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.920
in using Sahel land for agriculture.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.040
More benefits,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.160
higher employment,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.080
climate change mitigation
by reversing desertification

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.920
and greater food security.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.040
Nice vision, right?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.280
Well, we are working
towards getting it done.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.496
Last month we introduced fonio
to shoppers in New York City

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.736
and online,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.416
in a package that makes it attractive
and desirable and accessible.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.640
(Applause)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.696
We are talking with operators
and investors in West Africa

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.600
about building a fonio mill.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.056
And most importantly,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.256
we have teamed with an NGO
called SOS SAHEL

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.176
to recruit, train and equip
smallholders in the Sahel

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.080
to increase their fonio production.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.736
Hunger levels are higher
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.200
than any other place in the world.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.936
The Sahel population is set to grow

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.520
from 135 million to 340 million people.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.936
However, in that drought-
and famine-prone region,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.600
fonio grows freely.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.160
This tiny grain may provide big answers,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.416
reasserting its Dogon name,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.216
"po," the seed of the universe,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.416
and taking us one step closer

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.200
to the universal civilization.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.096
Thank you.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.200
(Applause)
