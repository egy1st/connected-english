00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:04.044
Caitlin Quattromani: The election
of 2016 felt different.

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:07.601
Political conversations
with our family and friends

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.411
uncovered a level of polarization

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.029
that many of us had not
previously experienced.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.193
People who we always thought
were reasonable and intelligent

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.802
seemed like strangers.

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:20.485
We said to ourselves,
"How could you think that?

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.381
I thought you were smart."

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:25.798
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met
in the summer of 2011,

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:27.712
and we bonded around being working moms

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.802
and trying to keep
our very energetic boys busy.

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:33.826
And we soon found out
we had almost everything in common.

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:37.811
From our love of Colorado
to our love of sushi,

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:39.905
there wasn't much we didn't agree on.

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.654
We also discovered that we share
a deep love of this country

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:46.638
and feel a responsibility
to be politically active.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:48.907
But no one's perfect --

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.979
(Laughter)

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:54.006
and I soon found out
two disappointing things about Caitlin.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.653
First, she hates camping.

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:58.725
CQ: I think camping is the worst.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.367
LA: So there would not be
any joint camping trips in our future.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.741
The second thing is that
she's politically active all right --

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.985
as a conservative.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.892
CQ: I may hate camping,
but I love politics.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:15.121
I listen to conservative talk radio
just about every day,

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.844
and I've volunteered for a few different
conservative political campaigns.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.613
LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:23.051
like all the way to the left.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:24.654
(Laughter)

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:26.774
I've always been interested in politics.

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:28.376
I was a political science major,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.783
and I worked as a community organizer
and on a congressional campaign.

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:34.828
CQ: So as Lauran and I
were getting to know each other,

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:37.775
it was right in the middle
of that 2012 presidential campaign,

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.292
and most of our early
political conversations

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:42.831
were really just based
in jokes and pranks.

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:46.276
So as an example, I would change
Lauran's computer screen saver

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.729
to a picture of Mitt Romney,

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.150
or she would put an Obama
campaign magnet on the back of my car.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:52.185
(Laughter)

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.249
LA: Car, not minivan.

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:57.281
CQ: But over time,
those conversations grew more serious

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.964
and really became
a core of our friendship.

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:01.406
And somewhere along the line,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.409
we decided we didn't want to have
any topic be off limits for discussion,

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:09.607
even if those topics pushed us way
outside of our friendship comfort zone.

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:11.115
LA: And so to most of us,

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.735
political conversations
are a zero-sum game.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.736
There's a winner and there's a loser.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.013
We go for the attack and we spot
a weakness in someone's argument.

00:02:19.037 --> 00:02:20.520
And here's the important part:

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:23.640
we tend to take every comment
or opinion that's expressed

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.750
as a personal affront
to our own values and beliefs.

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:30.620
But what if changed the way
we think about these conversations?

00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:33.477
What if, in these heated moments,

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.778
we chose dialogue over debate?

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:39.666
When we engage in dialogue,
we flip the script.

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:43.075
We replace our ego and our desire to win

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.178
with curiosity, empathy

00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:46.687
and a desire to learn.

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.777
Instead of coming
from a place of judgment,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.673
we are genuinely interested
in the other person's experiences,

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:54.697
their values and their concerns.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.362
CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.602
But getting to that place
of true dialogue is hard,

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.037
especially when we're talking
about politics.

00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:05.676
It is so easy to get emotionally fired up

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.816
about issues that we're passionate about,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.775
and we can let our ego
get in the way of truly hearing

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.532
the other person's perspective.

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:15.129
And in this crazy political climate
we're in right now,

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.945
unfortunately, we're seeing
an extreme result

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.315
of those heated political conversations,

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.308
to the point where people are willing
to walk away from their relationships.

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:27.301
In fact, Rasmussen released
a poll earlier this year

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:32.039
that said 40 percent of people
reported that the 2016 election

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:35.087
negatively impacted
a personal relationship,

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.547
and the Journal of Cognitive
Neuroscience tells us

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.500
that people tend to feel
their way to their beliefs

00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:42.237
rather than using reasoning,

00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:45.318
and that when reason and emotion collide,

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:47.762
it's emotion that invariably wins.

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:50.365
So no wonder it's hard
to talk about these issues.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.438
LA: And look, we're just
two regular friends

00:03:52.462 --> 00:03:54.772
who happen to think very differently

00:03:54.796 --> 00:03:58.096
about politics and the role
that government should play in our lives.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:01.051
And I know we were all taught
not to talk about politics

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.519
because it's not polite,

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.456
but we need to be able to talk about it,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.635
because it's important to us
and it's a part of who we are.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.421
CQ: We have chosen
to avoid political debate

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.668
and instead engage in dialogue

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:15.233
in order to maintain what we fondly call

00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.034
our bipartisan friendship.

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.788
(Laughter)

00:04:18.812 --> 00:04:21.820
LA: And this election
and all of the craziness that has followed

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:24.873
has given us several opportunities
to practice this skill.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.739
(Laughter)

00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:28.955
Let's start with January
and the Women's March.

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.406
At this point, you can probably guess
which one of us participated.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.773
(Laughter)

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:35.766
CQ: Oh, the Women's March.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.592
I was annoyed and irritated
that entire day,

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:40.407
really because of two things.

00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:43.296
Number one, the name "Women's March."

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.556
As a conservative woman,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.572
the march's platform of issues
didn't represent me,

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:48.770
and that's OK,

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:52.065
but hearing it talked about
as this demonstration of sisterhood

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:53.756
and solidarity for all women

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.439
didn't ring true for me.

00:04:55.463 --> 00:04:57.512
The other piece
was the timing of the event,

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:00.844
the fact that it was the day
after the presidential inauguration.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.584
It felt like we weren't even
giving the new administration

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:05.761
to actually do anything, good or bad,

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.515
before people felt the need
to demonstrate against it.

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:11.840
LA: And under normal circumstances,
I would agree with Caitlin.

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.865
I think an administration
does deserve the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.156
But in this case, I was marching
to show my concern

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.649
that a man with such a poor track record
with women and other groups

00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:23.187
had been elected as president.

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.793
I had to be part of the collective voice

00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:28.759
that wanted to send a clear message
to the new president

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:31.047
that we did not accept or condone

00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:33.527
his behavior or rhetoric
during the election.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:36.623
CQ: So I'm already feeling
kind of aggravated,

00:05:36.647 --> 00:05:41.060
and then I see this Facebook from Lauran
pop up in my social media feed.

00:05:41.084 --> 00:05:42.091
(Laughter)

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.432
Seeing Lauran's sons at the march
and holding signs

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:48.750
took it to a new level for me,
and not in a good way,

00:05:48.774 --> 00:05:50.370
because I know these boys,

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:51.830
I love these boys,

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:53.736
and I didn't feel they were old enough

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.672
to understand what the march stood for.

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:57.743
I didn't understand
why Lauran would choose

00:05:57.767 --> 00:05:59.560
to have them participate in that way,

00:05:59.584 --> 00:06:02.908
and I assumed it wasn't a choice
that the boys made for themselves.

00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:05.310
But I also know Lauran.

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:06.549
You're an incredible mom

00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:09.108
who would never exploit
your boys in any way,

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:10.879
so I had to stop and check myself.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.567
I had a decision to make.

00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:14.195
I could take the easy way out

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.969
and just choose
not to say anything to her,

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:20.010
and instead just kind of simmer
in my frustration,

00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:23.241
or I could ask her to learn more
about her motivations.

00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:24.647
LA: And I shared with Caitlin

00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:26.980
that we actually started
talking about the March

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:28.650
weeks before we participated.

00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:31.878
And my boys were curious
as to why the event was being organized,

00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:35.107
and this led to some
very interesting family conversations.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:39.107
We talked about how in this country,
we have the right and the privilege

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.853
to demonstrate against
something we don't agree with,

00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:44.989
and my husband shared with them
why he thought it was so important

00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:46.963
that men joined the Women's March.

00:06:46.987 --> 00:06:49.868
But the most significant reason
we marched as a family

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:53.002
is that it was a way for us to honor
my parents' legacy.

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:54.840
They spent their careers

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:58.748
working to defend the rights
of some of our most vulnerable citizens,

00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:01.345
and they passed these values
down to me and my brother,

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.523
and we want to do the same with our sons.

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:04.886
CQ: After talking to Lauran,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.767
I really understood not only
why she felt it was so important to march,

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.680
but why she had her boys with her.

00:07:10.704 --> 00:07:12.951
And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.

00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.680
It was the boys who wanted to march

00:07:14.704 --> 00:07:16.895
after they talked about
the issues as a family.

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:19.451
But what's most important
about this example

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:21.276
is to think about the alternative.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.119
Had Lauran and I not talked about it,

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:24.811
I would have been annoyed with her,

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.612
and it could have resulted
in an undercurrent of disrespect

00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:28.802
in our friendship.

00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:31.980
But by asking Lauran questions,
it allowed us to use dialogue

00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:34.028
to get to a place of true understanding.

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:35.952
Now, to be clear,

00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:39.841
our conversation didn't really change
my mind about how I felt about the March,

00:07:39.865 --> 00:07:44.005
but it absolutely changed my thinking
around why she brought her boys with her.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:47.014
And for both of us,
that dialogue allowed us to understand

00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:49.307
each other's perspective
about the Women's March

00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:50.648
even though we disagreed.

00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:54.930
LA: The second topic that challenged
our ability to engage in dialogue

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:56.967
was around my need to understand

00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.927
how Caitlin could vote for Trump.

00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:04.760
(Laughter)

00:08:05.483 --> 00:08:08.908
Caitlin is a successful professional woman

00:08:08.932 --> 00:08:11.539
who is deeply caring and compassionate,

00:08:11.563 --> 00:08:12.944
and the Caitlin I know

00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:16.127
would never excuse any man
from talking about women

00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.285
the way that Trump did
during the campaign.

00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:21.810
It was hard for me to reconcile
these two things in my mind.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.235
How could you overlook
the things that were said?

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.891
CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be
the only one here that thought

00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:31.297
we didn't have the best choices
for the presidential election last year.

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:32.740
(Laughter)

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.660
The Republican candidate who I did support
didn't make it out of the primary,

00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:39.478
so when it came time to vote,
I had a decision to make.

00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:42.071
And you're right,
there were some terrible things

00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:44.208
that came out during the Trump campaign,

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.755
so much so that I almost decided
to just abstain

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:48.364
rather than voting for president,

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:51.142
something I had never
even considered doing before.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.365
But ultimately,
I did vote for Donald Trump,

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:56.910
and for me it was really a vote
for party over person,

00:08:56.934 --> 00:09:00.656
especially recognizing
how important that presidential pick is

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.680
on influencing our judicial branch.

00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:06.503
But I shared with Lauran
it was a decision I really wrestled with,

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:08.264
and not one that I made lightly.

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.263
LA: And so after our conversation,
I was struck by a few things.

00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:15.696
First, I had fallen victim
to my own confirmation bias.

00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:18.374
Because of my strong feelings about Trump,

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:21.066
I had given all Trump voters
the same attributes,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.654
and none of them forgiving.

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:23.828
(Laughter)

00:09:23.852 --> 00:09:27.336
But knowing Caitlin,
I started to ask questions.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.516
What were Trump voters
really concerned about?

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.722
Under all the divisive language,
what was really going on?

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:36.888
What could we learn
about ourselves and our country

00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:38.438
from this unlikely event?

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:43.694
I also learned that we shared
a deep disappointment in this election,

00:09:43.718 --> 00:09:47.288
and that we have growing concerns
about our two-party political system.

00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:50.430
But the most important thing
about this conversation

00:09:50.454 --> 00:09:51.839
is that it happened at all.

00:09:53.074 --> 00:09:56.462
Without an open and honest dialogue
between the two of us,

00:09:56.486 --> 00:09:59.138
this election would have been
the elephant in the room

00:09:59.162 --> 00:10:01.827
for the next four years, pun intended.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.271
(Laughter)

00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:07.446
CQ: So, look --

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.732
(Applause)

00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:13.145
So, look -- we know it takes work
to get past the difficult,

00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:15.534
frustrating and sometimes emotional parts

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:18.519
of having discussions about issues
like the Women's March

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:22.677
or why your friend may have voted
for a candidate that you can't stand.

00:10:23.252 --> 00:10:25.467
But we need to have these conversations.

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.038
Our ability to move past political debate

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:29.538
into true dialogue

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.564
is a critical skill we should all
be focused on right now,

00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:35.284
especially with the people
that we care about the most.

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:39.167
LA: And it's not just as adults
that we need to bottle this behavior.

00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:41.862
It's critical that we do it
for our children as well.

00:10:42.203 --> 00:10:44.873
My sons were inundated with this election.

00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:47.041
We were listening
to the news in the morning,

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:50.134
and they were having conversations
with their friends at school.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.680
I was concerned that they were picking up
so much polarizing misinformation,

00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:57.782
and they were growing really fearful
of a Trump presidency.

00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:03.235
Then one day, after the election,
I was taking my sons to school,

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.728
and my younger son,
completely out of the blue,

00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:10.656
said, "Mom, we don't know anybody
who voted for Trump, right?"

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.649
(Laughter)

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:17.609
And I paused and I took a deep breath.

00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:19.425
"Yes, we do."

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:20.449
(Laughter)

00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:21.623
"The Quattromanis."

00:11:21.944 --> 00:11:24.013
And his response was so great.

00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:27.227
He kind of got this confused
look on his face, and he said ...

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:28.870
"But we love them."

00:11:28.894 --> 00:11:31.862
(Laughter)

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:33.679
And I answered, "Yes, we do."

00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:34.757
(Laughter)

00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:37.539
And then he said,
"Why would they vote for him?"

00:11:38.412 --> 00:11:40.128
And I remember stopping and thinking

00:11:40.152 --> 00:11:42.952
that it was really important
how I answered this question.

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:46.351
Somehow, I had to honor
our own family values

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:48.184
and show respect for our friends.

00:11:48.877 --> 00:11:50.449
So I finally said,

00:11:50.473 --> 00:11:53.141
"They think that's the right direction
for this country."

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:55.959
And before I had even gotten
the whole sentence out,

00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:59.126
he had moved on to the soccer game
he was going to play at recess.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.322
CQ: So life with boys.

00:12:00.346 --> 00:12:01.379
(Laughter)

00:12:01.403 --> 00:12:04.763
So what Lauran and I have discovered
through our bipartisan friendship

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:07.767
is the possibility that lives in dialogue.

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:10.133
We have chosen to be genuinely curious

00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:12.835
about each other's ideas and perspectives

00:12:12.859 --> 00:12:16.679
and to be willing to listen to one another
even when we disagree.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:19.828
And by putting aside our ego
and our preconceived ideas,

00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:22.415
we've opened ourselves up
to limitless learning.

00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:25.584
And perhaps most importantly
for our relationship,

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:27.640
we have made the commitment to each other

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.529
that our friendship is way more important

00:12:30.553 --> 00:12:34.663
than either of us being right
or winning a conversation about politics.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.381
So today, we're asking you
to have a conversation.

00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:40.672
Talk to someone outside
of your political party

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.317
who might challenge your thinking.

00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:44.166
Make an effort to engage with someone

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.159
with whom you might typically
avoid a political conversation.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.048
But remember, the goal isn't to win,

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:52.710
the goal is to listen and to understand

00:12:52.734 --> 00:12:54.984
and to be open to learning something new.

00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:57.730
LA: So let's go back to election night.

00:12:58.064 --> 00:12:59.327
As the polls were closing

00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:02.660
and it became clear that Trump
was going to be our new president,

00:13:02.684 --> 00:13:03.882
I was devastated.

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:07.296
I was sad, I was confused,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.104
and I'll be honest -- I was angry.

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:11.736
And then just before midnight,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.117
I received this text message from Caitlin.

00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:17.513
[I know this is a hard night for you guys.

00:13:17.537 --> 00:13:20.641
We are thinking of you. Love you.]

00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:24.475
And where there so easy could have been
weeks or months of awkwardness

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:27.458
and unspoken hostility, there was this --

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.800
an offering of empathy
rooted in friendship.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:34.687
And I knew, in that moment,
that we would make it through this.

00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:39.308
CQ: So we must find a way
to engage in meaningful conversations

00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:41.684
that are going to move us
forward as a nation,

00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:43.129
and we can no longer wait

00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:46.532
for our elected officials
to elevate our national discourse.

00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:50.287
LA: The challenges ahead
are going to require all of us

00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:53.215
to participate in a deeper
and more meaningful way ...

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.228
and it starts with each one of us

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.411
building connection through dialogue --

00:13:58.435 --> 00:14:02.102
in our relationships, our communities

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:03.276
and as a country.

00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:05.330
Thank you.

00:14:05.354 --> 00:14:12.214
(Applause)
