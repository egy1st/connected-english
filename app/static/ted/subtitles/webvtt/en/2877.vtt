00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.120
Today, more than half
of the world's population lives in cities.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.856
The urbanization process
started in the late 1700s

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.176
and has been increasing since then.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.256
The prediction is that by 2050,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.296
66 percent of the population
will live in cities

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.856
and the United Nations,
the World Health Organization,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.336
the World Economic Forum, are warning us,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.056
if we don't plan
for the increased density,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.176
current problems in our cities,
like inequality, congestion, crime

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.576
can only get worse.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.216
As a result, urban planners
and city developers

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.776
are putting a lot of effort and creativity

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.680
in designing our future,
denser, bigger cities.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.576
But I have a different opinion.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.616
I think urbanization is actually
reaching the end of its cycle,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.960
and now people are going to start
moving back to the countryside.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.816
And you may think,
"But what about the trend?"

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.816
Well, let me tell you,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.280
socioeconomic trends don't last forever.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.936
You know, 12,000 years ago

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.976
everybody was perfectly happy

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.016
roaming the land, hunting and gathering.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.696
And then, the trend changes,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.176
and the new thing
is to live in a farm and have cattle,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.016
until it changes again.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.600
When we get to the industrial revolution.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.096
Actually, that is what started
the urbanization process.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.600
And you know what triggered it?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.920
Steam power, machines,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.616
new chemical processes --

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.840
in two words, technological innovation.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.600
And I believe technology
can also bring the end of this cycle.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.456
I've been working on innovation
for most of my career.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.616
I love it. I love my job.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.736
It allows me to work with drones,
with 3D printers and smart glasses,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.816
and not just those you can buy in the shop
but also prototypes.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.120
It's a lot of fun sometimes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.856
Now, some of these technologies

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.976
are opening new possibilities
that will radically change

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.776
the way we did things before

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.776
and in a few years,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.696
they may allow us
to enjoy the benefits of city life

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.376
from anywhere.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.616
Think about it.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.416
If you could live in a place
with a lower crime rate

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.776
and more space

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.536
and a lower cost of living

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.960
and less traffic,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.936
of course many people would want that,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.656
but they feel they don't have a choice.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440
You have to live in the city.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.776
Well, in the past,
people moved to the cities

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.376
not because they loved the city itself

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.056
but for the things
you could have in a city,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.896
more job opportunities,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.976
easier access to services and goods

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.200
and a rich social life.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
So let's dive deeper.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.280
More jobs and career opportunities.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.456
Is that still true today,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.656
because the office people
are starting to realize

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.656
that working in the office
and being in the office

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.320
may not be the same thing anymore.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.416
According to a study
by Global Workplace Analytics,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.640
more than 80 percent of the US workforce
would like to work from home.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.320
And do you know how much it costs
for a company to even have an office?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.920
11,000 dollars per employee per year.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.576
If only half of those workers

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.960
would telework
even 50 percent of the time,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.856
the savings in the states
would exceed 500 billion dollars,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.656
and it could reduce greenhouse gases
by 54 million tons.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.936
That is the equivalent

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.040
of 10 million cars
off the streets for a whole year.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.576
But even though most people
would want to telework,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.136
current technology
makes the experience isolating.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.416
It's not comfortable.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240
It doesn't feel like being there.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.376
But that is going to change

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.696
by the convergence of two technologies:

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720
augmented reality and telepresence robots.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.576
Augmented reality already today

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.136
allows you to take your office
environment everywhere with you.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.656
All you need is a wearable computer,
a pair of smart glasses,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.056
and you can take your emails
and your spreadsheets

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.320
with you wherever you go.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.856
And video conferences and video calls
have become very common these days,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.296
but they still need improvement.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.240
I mean, all those little faces
on a flat screen,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.576
sometimes you don't
even know who is talking.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.416
Now, we already have something
way better than static videocalls:

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.096
your average telepresence robot.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.520
I call it tablet on a stick.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:42.256
(Laughter)

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.016
You can control, you can move around,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.216
you can control what you're looking at.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.520
It's way better, but far from perfect.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.376
You know how they say

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.440
that most human
communication is nonverbal?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.736
Well, the robot doesn't
give you any of that.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.120
It looks like an alien.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200
But with advances in augmented reality,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.496
it will be easy to wrap the robot
in a nice hologram

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.800
that actually looks
and moves like a person.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.720
That will do it.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.416
Or else, forget the robot.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.416
We go full VR,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.760
and everybody meets in cyberspace.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.896
Give it a couple of years
and that will feel so real,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.640
you won't tell the difference.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.840
So what was the next reason
why people move to cities?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.480
Access to services and goods.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.920
But today you can do all that online.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.240
According to a study made by comScore,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.776
online shoppers in the US last year

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.280
did more than half
of their retail purchases online,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.536
and the global market for e-commerce

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.536
is estimated to be
at two trillion dollars.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.776
And it's expected to reach 2.38
by the end of 2017,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.200
according to eMarketer.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.320
Now, from a logistics standpoint,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.080
density is good for deliveries.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.200
Supplying goods
to a shopping mall is easy.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.496
You can send big shipments to the shop,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.656
and people will go there, pick it up
and take it home themselves.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.336
E-commerce means we need to ship onesies

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.136
and have them home delivered.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.416
That's more expensive.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.136
It's like the difference between
having a birthday party for 20 people

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.256
or bringing a piece of the cake

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.920
to each of your 20 friends at their place.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.376
But at least in the city,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.856
they live close to each other.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.120
Density helps.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.440
Now, e-commerce deliveries
in the countryside,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.800
those take forever.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.136
The truck sometimes needs to drive miles
between one address and the next one.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.880
Those are the most expensive
deliveries of all.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.616
But we already have a solution for that:

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.056
drones.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.456
A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.336
The driver does some of the deliveries

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.696
while the drones are flying
back and forth from the truck as it moves.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.256
That way, the average cost
for delivery is reduced,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.760
and voila:

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.000
affordable e-commerce services
in the countryside.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.176
You will see:

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.936
the new homes of our teleworkers

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.360
will probably have
a drone pod in the yard.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.216
So once the final mile delivery
is not a problem,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.840
you don't need to be in the city
to buy things anymore.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.296
So that's two.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.000
Now, what was the third reason
why people move to cities?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.760
A rich social life.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.336
They would need to be
in the city for that these days.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.416
Because people these days,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.816
they make friends,
they chat, gossip and flirt

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.656
from the comfort of their sofa.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.016
(Laughter)

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.456
And while wearing their favorite pajamas.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.776
(Laughter)

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.920
There are over two billion
active social media users in the world.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.856
In a way, that makes you think
like we are connected

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.096
no matter where we are.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.416
But OK, not completely.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.880
Sometimes you still need
some real human contact.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.776
Ironically, the city,
with its population density,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
is not always the best for that.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.776
Actually, as social groups become smaller,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.416
they grow stronger.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.656
A recent study made in the UK

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.816
by the Office for National Statistics

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.696
showed a higher life satisfaction rating

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.440
among people living in rural areas.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.296
So as people settle in the countryside,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.296
well, they will buy local groceries,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.135
fresh groceries, foodstuff,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.360
maintenance services.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.520
So handymen, small workshops,
service companies will thrive.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.456
Maybe some of the industrial
workers from the cities

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.800
displaced by the automation

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.096
will find a nice alternative job here,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.320
and they will move too.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.736
And as people move to the countryside,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.416
how is that going to be?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.216
Think about autonomous,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.296
off-the-grid houses with solar panels,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.040
with wind turbines
and waste recycling utilities,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.096
our new homes producing their own energy
and using it to also power the family car.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.216
I mean, cities have always been regarded
as being more energy-efficient,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.496
but let me tell you,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.000
repopulating the countryside
can be eco too.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.400
By now, you're probably thinking
of all the advantages of country living.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.256
(Laughter)

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.536
I did it myself.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.096
Six years ago, my wife and I,
we packed our stuff,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.056
we sold our little apartment in Spain,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.176
and for the same money
we bought a house with a garden

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.776
and little birds that come
singing in the morning.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.256
(Laughter)

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.856
It's so nice there.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.856
And we live in a small village,
not really the countryside yet.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.056
That is going to be my next move:

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.296
a refurbished farmhouse,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.520
not too far from a city, not too close.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.416
And now we'll make sure
to have a good spot for drones to land.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.616
(Laughter)

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.376
But hey, that's me.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.656
It doesn't have to be you,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.416
because it would seem
like I'm trying to convince somebody

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.936
to come join us in the country.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.176
I'm not.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.576
(Laughter)

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.256
I don't need more people to come.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.096
(Laughter)

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.896
I just think they will

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.280
once they realize they can have
the same benefits the city has.

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:25.696
But if you don't like the country,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.180
I have good news for you, too.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.800
Cities will not disappear.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.896
But as people move out,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.840
a lower density will help them
recover a better flow and balance.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.880
Anyway, I guess now
you have some thinking to do.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.256
Do you still think
you need to live in the city?

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.880
And more importantly,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.720
do you want to?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.016
Thank you very much.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.040
(Applause)
