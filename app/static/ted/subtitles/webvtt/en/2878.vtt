00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:04.453
It was the end of October
in the mountains in Austria.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.878
I was there on a field trip
with my architecture students from Zurich.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.026
And when we reached a high valley,

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.268
I surprised them with the news
that there was no hut

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:17.910
or hotel booked for the night.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.219
It was not a mistake.

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.131
It was totally on purpose.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:28.910
The challenge was to build our own shelter
with whatever we could find.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:32.054
And we all survived.

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:34.371
It was cold, it was really tough ...

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.705
and it was a great learning experience

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.539
to discover that there are a lot
of resources given by nature for free,

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:45.380
and all that we need
is our sensitivity to see them ...

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.210
and our creativity to use them.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.417
I found myself in a similar situation.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:58.926
When I was an architecture student
about 13 years ago,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.239
I went to Bangladesh
to a remote village called Rudrapur

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:05.628
with the aim to design and build
a school as my thesis project.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:09.383
I had lived in that village before
when I was 19 and a volunteer

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:12.344
at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO
for rural development.

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.050
And what I had learned from them

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.852
was that the most sustainable strategy
for sustainable development

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:24.035
is to cherish and to use
your very own resources and potential,

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.488
and not get dependent on external factors.

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:30.368
And this is what I tried to do
with my architecture as well.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.740
In terms of suitable building
materials for my school,

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:36.192
I didn't have to look far.

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:38.573
They were right under my feet:

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.587
mud, earth, dirt, clay,
however you call it ...

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.121
and bamboo that was growing all around.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.535
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:54.765
but we didn't need it.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.388
We had human energy

00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:58.610
and the people were happy
to have the work.

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:02.127
Tools were an issue, too,

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:03.714
but we had these guys,

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:05.166
water buffalos.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.866
We had also tried a bit cows,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.469
but interestingly,
they were too intelligent.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.906
They were always stepping
in the holes of the previous round.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.788
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:17.862
(Laughter)

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:20.521
the sand, which are
the ingredients in the walls.

00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.545
And except a small team of consultants

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.672
like my partner
for realization, Eike Roswag,

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.314
and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,

00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:33.696
it was all built by craftsmen
from the village.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.897
And this is the METI school
after six months of construction.

00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.264
(Applause)

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:42.447
Thank you.

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:44.073
(Applause)

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.202
Load-bearing earth walls
that really ground the school,

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.820
and large bamboo structures
that bring the lightness in.

00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:56.056
That's the classroom on the ground floor.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:58.842
Attached to it are the caves.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.177
They're for reading,
for snuggling, for solo work,

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.843
for meditation, for playing ...

00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:06.644
and the classroom on the top.

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:13.614
The children all signed
with their names in Bengali the doors,

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:16.979
and they did not only sign,
they also helped building the school.

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:21.109
And I'm sure you all had your hands
in mud or clay before.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.946
It's wonderful to touch. I love it.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.310
The children loved it.

00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:29.749
And can you imagine the feeling
of a small boy or a girl

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:33.702
or an illiterate day laborer standing
in front of that school building

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.267
and knowing that you built this

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.885
out of the ordinary bamboo
and just the dirt underneath your feet,

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.555
using nothing but your hands?

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:49.238
That gives such an enormous boost
of trust and confidence

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.278
in yourself and the community.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.294
And in the material.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:58.217
Especially mud has a very poor image.

00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.345
When we think of mud, we think of dirt --

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:03.583
it's ugly, it's nondurable --

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:06.138
and this is the image I want to change.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.906
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season
for this school now,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.184
really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.755
and the walls are standing strong.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:21.640
(Applause)

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.006
So how does it work?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.186
First rule, a good foundation
that keeps the wall dry from the ground,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.906
and second rule, a good roof
that protects from the top,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.440
and third rule, erosion control.

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.479
Mud walls need speed breakers

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:40.711
so that the rainwater
cannot run down the wall fast,

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:44.017
and these speed breakers
could be lines of bamboo

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:47.622
or stones or straw mixed into the mud,

00:04:47.646 --> 00:04:52.907
just like a hill needs trees or rocks
in order to prevent erosion.

00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.304
It works just the same way.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.373
And people always ask me
if I have to add cement to the mud,

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.872
and the answer is no.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:05.050
There is no stabilizer,
no coating on these walls,

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:06.398
only in the foundation.

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:10.112
So this is the close-up of the wall

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:13.596
after 10 rainy seasons,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.060
and as much as I grew a bit older,

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.806
the wall got some wrinkles as well.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.997
The edges my not be as sharp as before,

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.173
but it still looks pretty good,

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.927
and if it needs repairing,

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:25.942
it is really easy to do.

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.709
You just take the broken part,

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:30.471
make it wet, and put it back on the wall,

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.518
and it will look the same as before.

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:34.085
Wish that would work on me, too.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:37.410
(Laughter)

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.841
Yeah, and the great thing is,

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.286
if an earth wall is not needed anymore,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.551
it can go back to the ground it came from,

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.483
turn into a garden,

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:52.030
or get fully recycled
without any loss of quality.

00:05:52.607 --> 00:05:54.698
There's no other material
that can do this,

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:59.047
and this is why mud is so excellent
in terms of environmental performance.

00:06:00.421 --> 00:06:02.556
What about the economic sustainability?

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:04.518
When we built the school,

00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:06.919
I practically lived
on the construction site,

00:06:06.943 --> 00:06:09.967
and in the evening, I used to go
with the workers to the market,

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:12.067
and I could see
how they spent their money.

00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:16.284
And they would buy
the vegetables from their neighbors,

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:19.593
they would get a new haircut
or a new blouse from the tailor.

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:24.716
And because the main part
of the building budget

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.885
was spent on craftsmanship,

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.341
the school wasn't just a building,

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:33.529
it became a real catalyst
for local development,

00:06:33.553 --> 00:06:35.053
and that made me happy.

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:39.387
If I had designed the school
in cement and steel,

00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.014
this money would have been exported
and lost for those families.

00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:48.688
(Applause)

00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:53.506
The building budget at that time
was 35,000 euros --

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.491
it's probably doubled by now --

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.603
and this is a lot of money
for that region,

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:02.632
and especially because this money
is working within the community

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:03.934
and rotating fast,

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.640
and not on the stock market.

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:11.259
So when it comes to the economic
sustainability of my project,

00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:14.529
my main question is, who gets the profit?

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.966
How many of you in here

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.172
have some experience
living in a mud house?

00:07:21.514 --> 00:07:23.551
Chris Anderson, where is your hand?

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:24.632
(Laughter)

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:25.830
You? OK.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.290
Yeah.

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.479
It seems totally out of our focus,

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:36.137
but approximately three billion people
all around the planet

00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:38.644
are living in earth houses,

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.954
and it is a traditional building material

00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:43.691
in Europe just as much as in Africa.

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:47.617
Strangely enough,

00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:51.306
mud is not considered worthy
of being studied at universities ...

00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.479
so I brought the dirt to Harvard,

00:07:55.503 --> 00:07:57.710
(Laughter)

00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.710
precisely 60 tons of dirt
right in front of the main facade

00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:03.336
of the Graduate School of Design.

00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:07.622
Students and faculty
rolled up their sleeves,

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:08.801
got their hands dirty

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:12.224
and transformed the front
into a warm place for people to gather.

00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:14.964
Children would climb the structures,

00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:16.505
skaters would ride the ramp,

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.275
students having lunch breaks,

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:22.371
and it was particularly fascinating to see
how many people were touching the wall,

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:26.248
and we usually don't go around cities
caressing our facades, right?

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.133
(Laughter)

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.013
(Laughter)

00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:38.610
Of course, this was a small-scale project,

00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:41.730
but in terms of awareness-building
and in terms of education,

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:44.284
it was like an acupuncture trigger point.

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:49.281
And in fact, in more and more countries,

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:54.290
load-bearing earthen structures
are not allowed to be built anymore

00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:57.816
although they're traditional
and have lasted for hundreds of years,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.856
and not because the material is weak,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.032
but because there are
no architects and engineers

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:05.492
who know how to deal with that material.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.190
So education on all levels,

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:09.890
for craftsmen, engineers and architects,

00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:11.681
is really strongly needed.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:15.429
Equally important
is technological development,

00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:18.546
like prefabrication developed
by my colleague Martin Rauch,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.556
who is an Austrian artist
and expert in earthen structures.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.190
And he has created technologies
for rammed earth elements,

00:09:26.214 --> 00:09:28.647
for prefabrication
of rammed earth elements

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:32.432
that include insulation,
wall heatings and coolings

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:34.257
and all sorts of electrical fittings

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.574
that can be layered
to multistoried buildings,

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:39.275
and this is important in order to scale up

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.267
and in order to [speed] up the processes,

00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:44.591
like in the Ricola Herb Center
in Switzerland.

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:49.683
And finally, we need good built projects

00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:52.802
that prove you can build
with an ancient material

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.694
in a very modern way.

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:59.128
It is not a matter
of how old a material is;

00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:02.633
it's a matter of our creative
ability to use it today.

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:07.191
These, for example, are three hostels

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:09.562
that I did in China in the village Baoxi,

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:12.372
about six hours by bus from Shanghai.

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:16.550
The outside shape is woven bamboo,

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.137
and the inside core
is stones and rammed earth.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:23.514
And it is a traditional building material.

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:25.731
Even large parts
of the Great Wall of China

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:27.400
have been built with rammed earth,

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.717
but it's getting replaced by concrete.

00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.885
And this trend is happening very fast.

00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:36.885
Within only a couple of years,

00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:39.902
China has consumed more cement
than the United States

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:42.162
in the entire 20th century.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:46.127
And this trend of replacing
natural building materials

00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.404
with materials that require
a lot of energy,

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:50.214
that are energy-intensive,

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:52.279
and that emit CO2

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.643
is really clearly contributing
to climate change.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:57.080
And we have alternatives,

00:10:57.104 --> 00:11:01.355
such as mud, stones, timber,
bamboo, earth,

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:05.267
that are totally effective options
for all sorts of purposes.

00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:08.473
This, for example,
is an office building that we did

00:11:08.497 --> 00:11:10.878
for Omicron Electronics in Austria.

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.799
Mud is healthy for the planet,
but also for the human bodies,

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:16.465
and the material is low-tech,

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:18.712
but the performance is high-tech.

00:11:18.736 --> 00:11:22.815
The earth walls keep the highly
sophisticated tools in the building safe

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:24.750
by naturally regulating moisture.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.102
And this wall in my own home

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.554
is our humidfier.

00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:35.302
We love our six tons of dirt at home

00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:37.816
not only because
it's healthy and sustainable.

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:41.453
Its archaic warmth
is touching deep within.

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:47.430
My personal dream is to build
a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.859
(Laughter)

00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:51.034
Yeah.

00:11:51.058 --> 00:11:53.257
(Applause)

00:11:53.281 --> 00:11:54.830
And this dream isn't so crazy

00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:57.046
if you think of the mud city
of Shibam in Yemen

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.935
that was built in the 16th century

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.227
and has lasted now for 500 years.

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:07.374
What was possible that long ago
is possible today as well,

00:12:07.398 --> 00:12:11.002
and we can apply
all our technical know-how

00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:13.036
to these ancient materials

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.662
so that it meets our needs and our dreams.

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:20.277
All around us,

00:12:20.301 --> 00:12:22.053
and just below our feet ...

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.827
are wonderful natural building materials.

00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:27.226
Let's use them.

00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:30.137
And I deeply believe

00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:32.914
our homes, our work spaces, our cities

00:12:33.716 --> 00:12:36.295
would become more healthy and sustainable

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.762
and more humane

00:12:40.087 --> 00:12:41.293
and beautiful.

00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:43.083
Thank you.

00:12:43.107 --> 00:12:48.150
(Applause)
