00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.439
So, Ma was trying to explain
something to me

00:00:03.463 --> 00:00:05.254
about Grandma and when they grew up,

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:06.985
but I couldn't pay attention to her

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.941
because I was five years old,
and I was petrified.

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:12.950
I had just seen The Green Lady.

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:15.973
Now, about a week earlier,
I'd watched that movie "Godzilla,"

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.144
the one about that huge lizard-like beast
storming a major city,

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:23.485
and the thought of a green monster
coming for me was stuck in my mind.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.139
And yet there I was,
at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,

00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:28.944
just staring at her:

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.127
her horns,

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.312
her muscles --

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:32.717
all of it just frightened me.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:37.114
And I didn't know
whether she was a monster or a hero.

00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:40.360
So I decided to consult
the Google of the day --

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:41.664
"Ma! Ma!"

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:43.584
(Laughter)

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:48.049
My mother explained that The Green Lady
is actually the Statue of Liberty

00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:50.344
and that she was waving immigrants in.

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:54.663
Now, the part of her explanation
that really messed with my young head

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.322
was the fact that, according to Ma,

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:59.379
long before us,

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:02.555
The Green Lady was actually brown,

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:04.555
brown like me,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.045
and that she changed
colors over the years,

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:09.238
much like America.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:14.556
Now, the part that really
is intriguing about this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.211
is that when she changed colors,

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:17.976
she made me think about myself.

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.876
It all made sense to me,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.897
because as a first-generation American,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:23.398
I was surrounded by immigrants.

00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:27.232
In fact, within my immediate social circle
of the people who support me,

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.544
who enrich my life,

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:30.455
at least two are foreign-born.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.851
My life as a US citizen is in many ways
shaped by newcomers,

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.034
and chances are,

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:37.510
so is yours.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:41.187
There are more than 40 million
immigrants in the USA.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.721
According to census data,

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:47.407
a quarter of the nation's children
have at least one foreign-born parent.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:52.542
I know all these statistics
because I study global migration patterns.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.728
I'm a journalist,
and for the last few years,

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.159
I've been documenting
the lives of US citizens

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.111
who've lost people to deportation.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.438
And the numbers are enormous.

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:04.584
From 2008 to 2016,

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.902
more than three million people
were "ordered removed" --

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:10.953
that's the technical term
for being deported.

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:16.932
There is an economic, a political,
a psychological and an emotional cost

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:18.852
to those deportations --

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:21.678
the moments when these circles are broken.

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:23.448
I once asked a US soldier,

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:25.807
"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"

00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.010
And she told me,

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:29.020
"Because I'm proud to defend my country."

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:30.210
But I pressed to know --

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:32.091
"Really, when you're on base,

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.354
and you hear bombs
exploding in the distance,

00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:38.155
and you see soldiers coming back
who are gravely injured,

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:42.338
in that moment,
when you know you could be next,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.993
what does 'my country' mean?"

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:45.956
She looked at me.

00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:48.435
"My country is my wife,

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.773
my family,

00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:51.357
my friends, my soldiers."

00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:52.698
What she was telling me

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:56.090
is that "my country" is a collection
of these strong relationships;

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.983
these social circles.

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:00.626
When the social circles are weakened,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.682
a country itself is weaker.

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:06.845
We're missing a crucial aspect
in the debate about immigration policy.

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.892
Rather than focusing on individuals,

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:11.943
we should focus
on the circles around them,

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:14.956
because these are the people
who are left behind:

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860
the voters, the taxpayers,

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:19.162
the ones who are suffering that loss.

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:21.468
And it's not just the children
of the deported

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.833
who are impacted.

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:25.734
You have brothers and sisters
who are separated by borders.

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:28.565
You have classmates, teachers,
law enforcement officers,

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.821
technologists, scientists, doctors,

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.563
who are all scrambling
to make sense of new realities

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:37.019
when their social circles are broken.

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.540
These are the real lives
behind all these statistics

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:44.012
that dominate discussions
about immigration policy.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.997
But we don't often think about them.

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.534
And I'm trying to change that.

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:51.874
Here's just one of the real-life stories
that I've collected.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.918
And it still haunts me.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:58.227
I met Ramon and his son in 2016,

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:01.787
the same year both of them
were being ordered out of the country.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.349
Ramon was being deported to Latin America,

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:09.698
while his son, who was a sergeant
in the US military,

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:11.291
was being deployed.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.798
Deported ...

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.679
deployed.

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:19.294
If you just look at Ramon's case,

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:22.586
it wouldn't be clear how deeply
connected to the country he is.

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:24.627
But consider his son:

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.982
a US citizen defending a country
that's banished his father.

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.382
The social circle is what's key here.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.384
Here's another example
that illustrates those critical bonds.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.746
A group of citizens in Philadelphia
were concerned about their jobs,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.761
because the legal owner
of the restaurant where they worked

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.525
was an undocumented immigrant,

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.825
and immigration officials
had picked him up.

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:47.561
They rallied behind him.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:49.008
An immigration lawyer argued

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:51.206
he was too important
to the local community

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.678
to be deported.

00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:56.760
At the hearing, they even submitted
restaurant reviews --

00:04:56.784 --> 00:04:58.053
restaurant reviews!

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:03.313
In the end, a judge exercised
what's called "judicial discretion"

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:05.273
and allowed him to stay in the country,

00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:08.783
but only because they considered
the social circle.

00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:14.410
There are 23 million
noncitizens in the USA,

00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:16.502
according to verifiable federal data.

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:18.688
And that doesn't include the undocumented,

00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:22.066
because numbers for that population
are at best complex estimates.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.348
Let's just work with what we have.

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:27.414
That's 23 million social circles --

00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:30.343
about 100 million individuals

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:33.466
whose lives could be impacted
by deportation.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.663
And the stress of it all is trickling down
through the population.

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.962
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:44.759
found that 30 percent
of citizens in LA County

00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:47.104
are stressed about deportation,

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:50.104
not because they themselves
could be removed,

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:54.869
but rather, because members
of their social circle were at risk.

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.518
I am not suggesting that no one
should ever be deported;

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.393
don't confuse me with that.

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:04.584
But what I am saying is that we need
to look at the bigger picture.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:08.045
If you are within the sound of my voice,

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.519
I want you to close your eyes for a moment

00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:13.172
and examine your own social circle.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.536
Who are your foreign-born?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.874
What would it feel like
if the circle were broken?

00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:21.833
Share your story.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.174
I'm building a global archive
of first-person accounts

00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.459
and linking them with mapping technology,

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:31.387
so that we can see exactly
where these circles break,

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.485
because this is not
just an American issue.

00:06:34.816 --> 00:06:38.037
There are a quarter-billion migrants
around the world;

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:42.136
people living, loving and learning
in countries where they were not born.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.792
And in my career, in my life,
I've been one of them:

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:47.798
in China, in Africa, in Europe.

00:06:47.822 --> 00:06:50.972
And each time I become
one of these foreigners --

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:54.149
one of these strange-looking
guys in a new land --

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:56.142
I can't help but think back to that day

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.522
when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom

00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:00.450
all those decades ago,

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.072
when I was scared,

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:04.727
and I had just spotted that green lady.

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:09.730
And I guess the question
that I keep on thinking about

00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:11.006
when I see her

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.290
and all the younger replicas of her
that are so obviously brown,

00:07:15.314 --> 00:07:18.127
and even the paintings
that showcase her in the beginning

00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:20.257
as not quite green --

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:23.239
when I look at all of that,

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:27.386
the question that my research
seeks to answer

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.707
becomes, to me, the same one
that confounded me all those years ago:

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.092
Is she a monster

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:36.266
or a hero?

00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:38.421
Thank you.

00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:41.467
(Applause)
