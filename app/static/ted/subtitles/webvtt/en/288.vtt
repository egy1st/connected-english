00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I applied for university at a time when I was convinced

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And he was a clever man. He sort of said,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
this was my passion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
because it was art and mathematics put together.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He said to me something that just went completely over my head.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but I don't like grey pin-striped suits."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That really, the mixing of art and science was computers,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Something that would be important, but also something

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
knowing people who were either executives or wealthy,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My career, I mean, I'd done my career.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Didn't have to worry about earning money.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and bringing to the world the access of the computers,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that that was really the thing we should do.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Applause)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Those are conveyor belts that go around.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but then you'll see the ones up above.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and then test them for a few hours.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
just the same way as our kids do here.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to help them debug it. OK?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
April 11 to be precise -- called "Teaching Children Thinking."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
understand things differently, and when they debug the programs,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
they come the closest to learning about learning.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Kids don't program enough and boy,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's really important. Using applications is OK,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but programming is absolutely fundamental.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
a third, that I've never even seen before.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This photograph is very important because it's much later.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
one, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
you can get the best people in the world.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
If you look at our professional services, including search firms,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
including communications, including legal services, including banking,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and they're the best people.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and we had a queue of people.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
was very important, and the U.N. allowed us

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
before I met Yves Behar.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And while this machine in some sense is silly,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
there are four of them --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
That the reason that you want to be below two watts is

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter)

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And, in English, the word "cheap" has

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
a double meaning, which is really appropriate,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
so you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And I can race through these and save a lot of time because

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you know, good design is very important.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The mesh network, the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
they're connected. There's not just laptops.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
If you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
If you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
or walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They're not going to be near another laptop,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And that's very important, the user interface.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Is there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
the keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand -- so you get it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
There is no keyboard standard because there's no market.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And this is the big difference.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Here's the six. We went to the six,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And so I went to each of those countries

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Not something you'd envy or want to do.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The camel smells were unbelievable.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I say former, because none of them really came through this summer --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
there was a big difference between getting a head of state

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
to have a photo opportunity, make a press release.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Small country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
but just a vanilla laptop proposal.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And guess what? We won it hands down.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The next day -- the next day, not even 24 hours had passed -- in Peru,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
the president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
still not enough.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We thought that was a good time to announce it.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Launched it on the 12 of November.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it got a lot of people absolutely interested.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The first day it was just wild. And then we said,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
whatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah, great.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I want you do something else.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Tell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Get your friends to give one, get one.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I won't dwell on the pricing at all.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Just to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,"

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
a lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
They went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
but we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
maybe by the middle of the year,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to hit a million a month. Now put that number,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
we're going to make 20 percent of the world production.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And we hope if you have EG two years from now,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
or whenever you have it again,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Thank you.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Applause)
