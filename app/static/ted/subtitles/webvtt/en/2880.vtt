00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:04.744
I'd like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.252
You're a little girl of five years old.

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.798
Sitting in front of a mirror,

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:13.321
you ask yourself,

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:15.586
"Do I exist?"

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.906
In this space, there is
very little context,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.494
and so you move into a different one,

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:24.092
one filled with people.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.387
Surely, now you know you're not
a figment of your own imagination.

00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:30.754
You breathe their air.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:32.815
You see them,

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:34.253
so they must see you.

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.988
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.309
Do I only exist when people speak to me?

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.750
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:53.509
But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.683
I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up

00:00:57.707 --> 00:01:02.821
feeling as if she's not seen,
and perhaps she doesn't exist.

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:08.106
You see, if young people don't have
positive images of themselves

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.298
and all that remains
are negative stereotypes,

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:13.147
this affects their self-image.

00:01:14.214 --> 00:01:17.560
But it also affects the way
that the rest of society treats them.

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:20.518
I discovered this

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:24.247
having lived in Cape Town
for about five years at the time.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:30.064
I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.386
I couldn't see myself represented.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.216
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.102
the ones who've influenced me,

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:41.857
and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.824
I decided to do something about it.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.698
What do you think when you see this?

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.872
If you were a black girl,

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:55.631
how would it make you feel?

00:01:57.273 --> 00:01:59.718
Walking down the street,

00:01:59.742 --> 00:02:02.656
what does the city you live in say to you?

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:05.062
What symbols are present?

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.151
Which histories are celebrated?

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.285
And on the other hand,

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:10.850
which ones are omitted?

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:15.754
You see, public spaces are hardly
ever as neutral as they may seem.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:22.472
I discovered this when I made
this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.

00:02:24.272 --> 00:02:29.407
Cape Town is teeming
with masculine architecture,

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.490
monuments and statues,

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.778
such as Louis Botha in that photograph.

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:40.752
This overt presence of white colonial
and Afrikaner nationalist men

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:46.198
not only echoes a social,
gender and racial divide,

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:51.553
but it also continues to affect
the way that women --

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:54.777
and the way, particularly, black women --

00:02:54.801 --> 00:03:00.212
see themselves in relation
to dominant male figures

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:01.661
in public spaces.

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:07.368
For this reason, among others,

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:09.464
I don't believe that we need statues.

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:14.392
The preservation of history
and the act of remembering

00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:18.751
can be achieved in more memorable
and effective ways.

00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:24.283
As part of a year-long
public holiday series,

00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:28.434
I use performance art
as a form of social commentary

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.656
to draw people's attention
to certain issues,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.630
as well as addressing the absence
of the black female body

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:39.892
in memorialized public spaces,

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:41.882
especially on public holidays.

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.774
Women's Day was coming up.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.982
I looked at what the day means --

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.615
the Women's March
to the union buildings in 1956,

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.099
petitioning against the pass laws.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.876
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
of how women are treated,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.031
especially in public spaces today,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.218
I decided to do something about it.

00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:08.993
Headline:

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:14.559
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.611
How do I comment on such polar opposites?

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:23.878
In the guise of my great-grandmother,

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.605
I performed bare-breasted,

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.585
close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:31.907
This space is also called Freedom Square,

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.784
where women were a part of demonstrations
against apartheid laws.

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:43.297
I was not comfortable with women
being seen as only victims in society.

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.161
You might wonder
how people reacted to this.

00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:50.629
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:52.954
Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!

00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:03.209
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?

00:05:04.134 --> 00:05:06.684
(Applause)

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:10.836
So I realized that through
my performances,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.944
I've been able to make regular people
reflect upon their society,

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:19.668
looking at the past
as well as the current democracy.

00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:22.649
(Video) Man (offscreen):
She's been there since three o'clock.

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:25.407
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
About an hour still?

00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:27.396
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.

00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:35.695
Man 1: It's very interesting.

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.225
It's very powerful.

00:05:38.324 --> 00:05:39.783
I think it's cool.

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:47.968
I think a lot of people
are quick to join a group

00:05:47.992 --> 00:05:49.864
that's a movement towards something,

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:55.115
but not many people are ready
to do something as an individual.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.746
Man 2: So it's the individual
versus the collective.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.926
Man 1: Yeah.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.207
So I think her pushing her own
individual message in performance ...

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.182
it's powerful.

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:11.359
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful
that she's doing it on her own.

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:17.607
I'd be interested to know why
she's using hair extensions as wings,

00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:21.379
or whatever those things are meant to be.

00:06:22.874 --> 00:06:24.565
They are wings, yes?

00:06:26.754 --> 00:06:29.020
Woman 3: With her standing
there right now,

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:33.004
I think it's just my interpretation

00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:36.399
that we are bringing the statue down

00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:38.648
and bringing up something

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:43.277
that's supposed to represent
African pride, I think.

00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:44.821
Or something like that.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.277
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:52.008
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.

00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:53.964
Yes. Thank you.

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:57.451
Man 3: What is behind me
represents the African culture.

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.864
We can't have the colonialist law,

00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:02.779
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.

00:07:02.803 --> 00:07:05.297
We have have our own statues now,

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:10.193
our African leaders --
Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:14.450
all those who paid their lives
for our liberation.

00:07:14.474 --> 00:07:16.782
We can't continue in the 21st century,

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:18.843
and after 21 years of democracy,

00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:21.007
have the colonizers in our own country.

00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:24.004
They belong somewhere.
Maybe in a museum; not here.

00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:27.178
I mean learning institutions,
places where young people,

00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:28.780
young minds are being shaped.

00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:33.494
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
Rhodes, all these people,

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:36.283
because they're representing
the colonialism.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:42.721
(Applause)

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:47.038
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,

00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:51.039
the Cecil John Rhodes statue
was scheduled to be removed

00:07:51.063 --> 00:07:55.278
after a month of debates
for and against its removal

00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:57.090
by various stakeholders.

00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:02.520
This caused a widespread interest
in statues in South Africa.

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:08.542
Opinions varied, but the media
focused on problematizing

00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:10.147
the removal of statues.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.927
On that -- well, that year,
I had just begun my master's

00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:18.816
at the University of Cape Town.

00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:23.635
During the time
of the debate of the statue,

00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:26.758
I had been having reoccurring dreams

00:08:27.593 --> 00:08:28.925
about a bird.

00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:32.175
And so I started conjuring her

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.666
mentally, spiritually and through dress.

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:39.745
On that day,

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.405
I happened to be having
a meeting with my supervisors,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.034
and they told me that the statue
was going to fall on that day.

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:50.524
I told them that I'd explain later,

00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:52.486
but we had to postpone the meeting

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.988
because I was going to perform her
as the statue came down.

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:59.412
Her name was Chapungu.

00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:03.816
She was a soapstone bird
that was looted from Great Zimbabwe

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.588
in the late 1800s,

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:09.645
and is still currently housed
in Cecil John Rhodes's estate

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:10.819
in Cape Town.

00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:13.280
On that day,

00:09:13.304 --> 00:09:17.414
I embodied her existence using my body,

00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:21.299
while standing in the blazing sun
for nearly four hours.

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.090
As the time came,

00:09:25.114 --> 00:09:26.657
the crane came alive.

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:28.978
The people did, too --

00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.161
shouting,

00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:31.422
screaming,

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.356
clenching their fists

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.262
and taking pictures of the moment
on their phones and cameras.

00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:39.458
Chapungu's wings,

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:40.881
along with the crane,

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:45.878
rose to declare the fall
of Cecil John Rhodes.

00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:51.219
(Applause)

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:56.785
Euphoria filled the air
as he became absent from his base,

00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:58.857
while she remained still,

00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:01.790
very present,

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:04.459
half an hour after his removal.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.210
Twenty-three years after apartheid,

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.637
a new generation of radicals
has arisen in South Africa.

00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:17.534
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
in the same space and time

00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:19.313
asks important questions

00:10:19.337 --> 00:10:21.612
related to gender,

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:23.513
power,

00:10:23.537 --> 00:10:25.318
self-representation,

00:10:25.342 --> 00:10:26.931
history making

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:28.383
and repatriation.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.400
From then on,

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:37.645
I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:40.184
texture my material reality.

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:44.792
But for me, Chapungu's story
felt incomplete.

00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:46.565
This soapstone bird,

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:50.956
a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.079
needed me to continue her story.

00:10:53.681 --> 00:10:58.097
And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,

00:10:58.121 --> 00:11:00.752
and this is how "Falling" was born.

00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:08.856
[A film by Sethembile Msezane]

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.125
(Video) (A capella singing)

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:43.180
[FALLING]

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.892
(Applause)

00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:51.901
In the film,

00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:55.683
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany
share a common story

00:11:55.707 --> 00:11:59.397
about the soapstone birds
that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.

00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:02.649
After Zimbabwe gained its independence,

00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:06.594
all the birds except for one
were returned to the monument.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:12.290
"Falling" explores the mythological belief
that there will be unrest

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.991
until the final bird is returned.

00:12:16.898 --> 00:12:18.221
Through my work,

00:12:18.245 --> 00:12:21.675
I have realized a lot
about the world around me:

00:12:22.237 --> 00:12:24.233
how we move through spaces,

00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:27.624
who we choose to celebrate

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:29.304
and who we remember.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.069
Now I look in the mirror
and not only see an image of myself,

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:37.934
but of the women
who have made me who I am today.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.764
I stand tall in my work,

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:44.249
celebrating women's histories,

00:12:44.273 --> 00:12:46.801
in the hope that perhaps one day,

00:12:47.494 --> 00:12:50.750
no little black girl has to ever feel

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:52.660
like she doesn't exist.

00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:53.904
Thank you.

00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:58.173
(Applause)
