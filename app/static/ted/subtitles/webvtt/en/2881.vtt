00:00:01.116 --> 00:00:05.227
What stands between Africa's current
prostrate condition

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:10.088
and a future of prosperity and abundance
for its long-suffering populations?

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.156
One word:

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.902
knowledge.

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:19.316
If Africa is to become a continent
that offers the best life for humans,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.298
it must become a knowledge society

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.590
immediately.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:28.697
This is what I have called
"Africa's knowledge imperative."

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.754
Our universities must reduce emphasis
on producing manpower

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:36.309
for running our civil society,

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.099
our economy

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:40.614
and our political institutions.

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:45.067
They should be dedicated mainly
to knowledge production.

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:50.044
What sense is there
in producing civil engineers

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:53.695
who are not supported
by soil scientists and geologists,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.007
who make it their business
to create knowledge about our soil

00:00:58.031 --> 00:00:59.451
and our rocks?

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:03.636
What use is there in producing lawyers

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.019
without juries who produce knowledge

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:12.134
of the underlying philosophical
foundations of the legal system?

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:15.706
We must seek knowledge.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.532
We must approach the matter of knowledge

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:22.421
with a maniacal commitment,

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:24.599
without let or hindrance.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.159
Though we must seek knowledge
to solve problems we know of,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.116
we must also seek knowledge

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.116
when there is no problem in view --

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.376
especially when there
is no problem in view.

00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:44.415
We must seek to know as much
of what there is to know of all things,

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.718
limited only by the insufficiency
of our human nature,

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:51.286
and not only when the need arises.

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:56.649
Those who do not seek knowledge
when it is not needed

00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:01.139
will not have it when they must have it.

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:06.872
The biggest crisis in Africa today
is the crisis of knowledge:

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:08.916
how to produce it,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.571
how to manage it,

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:13.303
and how to deploy it effectively.

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.474
For instance, Africa does not
have a water crisis.

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:22.218
It has a knowledge crisis
regarding its water,

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.738
where and what types it is,

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:31.766
how it can be tapped and made available
where and when needed to all and sundry.

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:35.803
How does a continent that is home

00:02:35.827 --> 00:02:38.891
to some of the largest
bodies of water in the world --

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:41.026
the Nile,

00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:42.828
the Niger,

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.676
the Congo,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250
the Zambezi

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:47.898
and the Orange Rivers --

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:50.996
be said to have a water crisis,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.067
including in countries

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.733
where those rivers are?

00:02:56.387 --> 00:02:58.308
And that is only surface water.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:03.006
While we wrongly dissipate our energies
fighting the wrong crises,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.712
all those who invest in knowledge about us

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:10.760
are busy figuring out
how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.729
to quench Europe's thirst.

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.184
Such is our knowledge
of our water resources

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:19.340
that many of our countries have given up

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:22.101
on making potable water a routine presence

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:23.884
in the lives of Africans,

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.563
rich or poor,

00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:27.042
high and low,

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.496
rural and urban.

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:32.722
We eagerly accept
what the merchants of misery

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:36.269
and the global African Studies
safari professoriat

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:38.249
and their aid-addled,

00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:41.122
autonomy-fearing African minions

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:44.384
in government, universities
and civil society

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:48.544
tell us regarding how nature
has been to stinting towards Africa

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:52.344
when it comes to the distribution
of water resources in the world.

00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:56.703
We are content to run our cities
and rural dwellings alike

00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:58.101
on boreholes.

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:04.618
How does one run metropolises
on boreholes and wells?

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:09.099
Does Africa have a food crisis?

00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:12.314
Again, the answer is no.

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:18.656
It is yet another knowledge crisis
regarding Africa's agricultural resources,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.700
what and where they are,

00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:25.237
and how they can be best managed
to make Africans live more lives

00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:26.610
that are worth living.

00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:30.255
Otherwise, how does one explain the fact

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.545
that geography puts the source
of the River Nile in Ethiopia,

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.964
and its people cannot
have water for their lives?

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:42.617
And the same geography
puts California in the desert,

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.312
but it is a breadbasket.

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:48.408
The difference, obviously,
is not geography.

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:50.742
It is knowledge.

00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:53.678
Colorado's aquifers

00:04:53.702 --> 00:04:55.842
grow California's pistachios.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.078
Why can't Libya's aquifers

00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:01.729
grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?

00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:05.715
Why does Nigeria not aspire

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.143
to feed the world,

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:09.095
not just itself?

00:05:09.797 --> 00:05:13.628
If Africa's land is so poor,
as we are often told,

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:15.860
why are outsiders,

00:05:15.884 --> 00:05:20.049
from the United Arab Emirates
all the way to South Korea,

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:23.325
buying up vast acreages of our land,

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.517
to grow food, no less,

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.238
to feed their people

00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:30.884
in lands that are truly more
geographically stinting?

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.296
The new landowners are not planning
to import new topsoil

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.222
to make their African
acquisitions more arable.

00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:43.220
Again, a singular instance
of knowledge deficiency.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.604
In the 19th century,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.890
our predecessors,

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:52.258
just years removed from the ravages
of slavery and the slave trade,

00:05:53.837 --> 00:05:57.028
were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers

00:05:57.052 --> 00:06:01.101
with a view to turning Africa's resources
to the advantage of its people

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.019
and to the rest of humanity,

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:07.616
and their 20th-century successors
were dreaming of harnessing

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.848
the powers of the River Congo

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:11.820
to light up the whole continent.

00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:16.078
Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.478
are scheming of doing the same,

00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:22.014
but for exports to Europe
and South Africa.

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:24.380
And they are even suggesting

00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:26.990
that Congolese may not
benefit from this scheme,

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:31.005
because, according to them,
Congolese communities are too small

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.568
to make providing them with electricity

00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:36.336
a viable concern.

00:06:38.174 --> 00:06:39.953
The solution?

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.921
Africa must become a knowledge society,

00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:46.110
a defining characteristic
of the modern age.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:52.175
We neither are, nor are we
on the path to becoming,

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.661
a knowledge society.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.022
Things have not always been this way

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:01.631
when it comes to knowledge
production and Africa.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:06.731
In antiquity, the world went to Africa
for intellectual enrichment.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.458
There were celebrated centers of learning,

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:14.562
attracting questers from all parts
of the then-known world,

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:16.981
seeking knowledge about that world.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:21.439
What happened then
has implications for our present.

00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:23.786
For example,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.476
how Roman Africa managed the relationship
between settlers and natives

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.092
between the second and fourth
centuries of our era

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:37.108
might have something to teach us
when it comes to confronting

00:07:37.132 --> 00:07:40.540
not-too-dissimilar problems
at the present time.

00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:45.115
But how many classics departments
do we have in our universities?

00:07:46.423 --> 00:07:48.946
Because we do not invest in knowledge,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.027
people come to Africa now

00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:53.577
not as a place of intellectual enrichment,

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:58.507
but as a place where they sate
their thirst for exotica.

00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:02.982
Yet for the last half-millennium,

00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:07.033
Africa has been hemorrhaging
and exporting knowledge

00:08:07.057 --> 00:08:08.464
to the rest of the world.

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:13.962
Regardless of the popular description
of it as a trade in bodies,

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:17.763
the European trans-Atlantic
slave trade and slavery

00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:21.208
was one of the most radical
and longest programs

00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:23.772
of African brains export in history.

00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:29.247
American slave owners may have pretended
that Africans were mere brutes,

00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:31.573
beasts of burden,

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:35.542
almost as inert and dumb
as other farm implements

00:08:35.566 --> 00:08:38.422
they classified them with
in their ledgers.

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.361
And that's what they did.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.539
The enslaved Africans, on the other hand,

00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:46.635
knew their were embodiments of knowledge.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.199
They were smiths, they were poets,

00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:52.546
they were political counselors,
they were princes and princesses,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.261
they were mythologists,
they were herbologists,

00:08:57.689 --> 00:08:59.182
they were chefs.

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.659
The list is endless.

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:03.861
They, to take a single example,

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:06.881
brought the knowledge of rice cultivation

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.395
to the American South.

00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:14.576
They created some of the most
original civilizational elements

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.442
for which the United States
is now celebrated.

00:09:18.237 --> 00:09:21.337
They deployed their knowledge,
for the most part,

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.881
without compensation.

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:27.375
For the last half-millennium,
beginning with the slave trade,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:30.045
Africa has been exporting brains

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:34.791
while simultaneously breaking
the chains of knowledge transmission

00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:36.545
on the continent itself,

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:40.716
with dire consequences for the systems
of knowledge production in Africa.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:46.234
Successive generations are cut off
from the intellectual production

00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:47.475
of their predecessors.

00:09:48.363 --> 00:09:51.406
We keep producing for external markets

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.466
while beggaring our own internal needs.

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.739
At present,

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.366
much of the best knowledge about Africa

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.698
is neither produced nor housed there,

00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:05.795
even when it is produced by Africans.

00:10:06.634 --> 00:10:09.095
Because we are dominated
by immediate needs

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:12.626
and relevant solutions when it comes
to what we should know,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.175
we are happy to hand over to others

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.659
the responsibility to produce knowledge,

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:21.961
including knowledge about, of and for us,

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:24.250
and to do so far away from us.

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:27.996
We are ever eager to consume knowledge

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.419
and have but a mere portion of it

00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:34.620
without any anxiety about
ownership and location.

00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:39.310
African universities
are now all too content

00:10:39.334 --> 00:10:42.860
to have e-connections
with libraries elsewhere,

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:45.758
having given up ambitions
on building libraries

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:49.473
to which the world would come
for intellectual edification.

00:10:50.411 --> 00:10:54.609
Control over who decides
what should be stocked on our shelves

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:58.273
and how access to collections
should be determined

00:10:58.297 --> 00:11:02.128
are made to rest on our trust
in our partners' good faith

00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:04.884
that they will not abandon us
down the road.

00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:08.170
This must change.

00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:12.614
Africa must become
a place of knowledge again.

00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:18.318
Knowledge production
actually expands the economy.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.337
Take archaeological digs, for instance,

00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:24.516
and their impact on tourism.

00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:28.907
Our desires to unearth our antiquity,

00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:33.704
especially those remote times
of which we have no written records,

00:11:33.728 --> 00:11:38.742
requires investment in archaeology
and related disciplines,

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:40.954
e.g., paleoanthropology.

00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:45.533
Yet, although it is our past
we seek to know,

00:11:45.557 --> 00:11:47.279
by sheer serendipity,

00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:51.800
archaeology may shed light
on the global human experience

00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:53.987
and yield economic payoffs

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.247
that were no part
of the original reasons for digging.

00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:04.916
We must find a way to make knowledge
and its production sexy and rewarding;

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:08.933
rewarding, not in the crass
sense of moneymaking

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.526
but in terms of making it worthwhile
to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.495
support the existence

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.696
of knowledge-producing
groups and intellectuals,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.895
ensuring that the continent

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:26.705
becomes the immediate locus
of knowledge production,

00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:28.662
distribution and consumption,

00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:31.880
and that instead of having
its depositories

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:33.897
beyond Africa's boundaries,

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:37.184
people once more come
from the rest of the world,

00:12:37.706 --> 00:12:41.175
even if in virtual space,
to learn from us.

00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:47.911
All this we do as custodians
on behalf of common humanity.

00:12:50.157 --> 00:12:52.731
Creating a knowledge society in Africa,

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:59.430
for me, would be one way to celebrate
and simultaneously enhance diversity

00:12:59.454 --> 00:13:04.308
by infinitely enriching it with material
and additional artifacts --

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:06.996
artifacts that we furnish

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.995
by our strivings

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:10.432
in the knowledge field.

00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:12.453
Thank you very much.

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:16.269
