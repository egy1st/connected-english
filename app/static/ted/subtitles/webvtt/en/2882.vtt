WEBVTT

00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:06.336
We humans are becoming an urban species,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.136
so cities, they are our natural habitat.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.360
That is where we live.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.976
In 2014, over 54 percent

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.616
of the world population

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.680
was living in cities,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.256
and I can bet you

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.936
that so many of these people have thought

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.536
of how they would do things differently,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.216
like if I only had the tools

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.616
to change things in my city,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.896
what would I do?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.520
What would my dream city be like?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.896
And these tools,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280
this is just what we gave them.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.656
Two years ago, my team and I,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.096
we released a game,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.816
"Cities: Skylines."

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680
It is a game about building cities.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.336
So I have always been
interested in cities as systems.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.256
It's something that I find
immensely interesting.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.416
But what I didn't understand

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920
was that I am not alone in this.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.336
People love cities.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.240
They are interested. They have ideas.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.096
The game was an instant hit.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.720
So far, over three and a half
million people have played it.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.056
And it's not just about playing.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.816
We also have really awesome
sharing systems.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.536
So people play, they create cities

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.376
and then they are sharing these creations,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440
showing off what they have made.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.536
And what I will show you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.776
is some of these cities

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.120
created by the players.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.216
So the game is about self-expression,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.496
creativity,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.136
not just overcoming the challenges
posed by the simulation.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.760
It is about showing
what your cities look like.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.576
So I have a couple of videos.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.416
These are from YouTube.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.895
And these are some of the most
interesting city designs I have seen.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.416
So they are all different,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.760
and I hope you like all of these.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.376
This one is called The Netherlands.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.600
It's by Silvarret.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.496
And when you start the game,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.600
you have an empty piece of land.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.056
This land, it can be based
on the real world,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.016
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.016
or you can, of course, download
a city made by someone else

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.576
and play in that.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.016
But what Silvarret has done here

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.616
is that what he wanted to make

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.376
was not a real city.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.056
This is a fantasy city,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.776
even though it looks real.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.640
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city
that could be in the Netherlands.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.656
So he kind of investigated

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.696
what are the characteristics
of cities in the Netherlands

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.296
and combined a couple of those,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.016
and this is what he created.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.696
So it is a city,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.976
but it is not a real city,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.256
but it could be.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.960
It looks just like the Netherlands.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.936
So the places are really
densely populated.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.936
So what you need is highways, trains,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.216
anything connecting
these small town centers together.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.456
Lots of people, lots of moving,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.600
so transportation is the key here.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.216
But then let's go even more
on the fantasy side.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.880
Let's go into the future.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.616
This is one of my personal favorites.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.360
These city designs
are what I love the most.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.296
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480
and the basic idea is
that you have concentric circle routes.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.536
So the city is a big circle

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.400
with tinier circles inside.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.656
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.096
and then people actually live
on the outer ring,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.896
because there is less traffic,
less noise, less pollution,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.856
so that is where you want to live.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.816
But the services
are still really close by.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.495
They are in the center.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.680
And this is the soul of the game.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.376
The player has to understand

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.976
what are the wishes, what are the needs

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
of the tiny people living in the cities.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.496
So you need to know
where you should put the things.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.056
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.816
It needs to be accessible.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.720
Citizens need to reach the hospital.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.176
And this is one way to do it.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.040
So maybe this is something
that we might be seeing someday.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.080
And then even more into the future.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.240
Astergea by Yuttho.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.616
So Yuttho does YouTube videos
and plays the game.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.296
What he did here
was actually a 12-point series

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.480
of creating this city.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.536
So what he does is he plays the game,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.816
he records it

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.480
and he explains as he's going
what he's doing and why.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.296
And as a part of this series,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.576
he actually did an interview
with an actual urban planner

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.400
called Jeff Speck.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.256
And Speck is an expert
on the concept of walkability.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.656
The basic idea is that
if you want your citizens to walk,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.616
which is kind of beneficial,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.376
you actually need to have walking
as a reasonable means of transportation.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.200
It should be a good way to reach places.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.376
So what Yuttho did
was that he explained this concept,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.416
he had Speck explain it, too,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.400
and then he applied it
to the city that he was building.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.096
So what we are seeing
is Yuttho's vision of the future:

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.376
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.000
connecting high-rise buildings.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.376
Maybe this is what
the future might look like.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.856
And the game system
works really well for this.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.696
We are seeing some
real-world uses to this game.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.416
So we know that some urban planners
are using it as a sketching tool,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.736
so while the simulation
is not completely realistic,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.696
it is realistic enough
that if something works in the game,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.616
it is highly likely that it
will also work in the real world,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.736
so that you can actually try out things,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.736
see if this intersection
might fit this kind of a situation.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.296
If we build a new road, would it help?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.280
And this is what you can do
with this game.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.176
There was one really
interesting contest held

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.880
by the Finnish city of HÃ¤meenlinna.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.656
So what they did
was that they had a new area

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.080
that they wanted to develop in the city.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.496
They made a map with the existing city,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.696
they left empty the area
that they would want to develop

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.056
and shared this map.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.096
So anyone could download the map,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.736
play the game, build the area

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.480
and submit their creations
to the city council.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.896
So they have not yet built anything,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.696
but it might just be
that they use one of these plans

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.056
made with the game

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.120
to actually build the real city.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.776
And these videos that I have shown you,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.400
these are the people who are
coming up with new kinds of solutions.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.856
We know that cities are growing.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.336
They're getting bigger as we go,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.576
and the percentage of population
living in cities is projected to rise.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.496
So we need the solutions

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.216
and these people, playing the game,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.896
they are trying out
different kinds of solutions.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.600
They might have something
that is really important.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.440
So what we are seeing here is dream cities
that might be real one day.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.976
So it might be

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.840
that this is not just a game.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.656
It might be a way

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.840
to decide our own fate.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.136
Thank you.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.840
(Applause)
