00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:05.126
Today I want to confess something to you,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.045
but first of all I'm going to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.822
How many people here have children?

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:13.254
And how many of you are confident

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:15.332
that you know how
to bring up your children

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:16.591
in exactly the right way?

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:20.056
(Laughter)

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.219
OK, I don't see too many hands
going up on that second one,

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:24.790
and that's my confession, too.

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.065
I've got three boys;

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.896
they're three, nine and 12.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.986
And like you, and like most parents,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.950
the honest truth is I have
pretty much no idea what I'm doing.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.054
I want them to be
happy and healthy in their lives,

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.064
but I don't know what I'm supposed to do

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.094
to make sure they are happy and healthy.

00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:43.095
There's so many books
offering all kinds of conflicting advice,

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.655
it can be really overwhelming.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.775
So I've spent most of their lives
just making it up as I go along.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:52.050
However, something changed me
a few years ago,

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:54.872
when I came across a little secret
that we have in Britain.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.846
It's helped me become more confident
about how I bring up my own children,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.279
and it's revealed a lot about
how we as a society can help all children.

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:04.982
I want to share that secret
with you today.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.065
For the last 70 years,

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:12.566
scientists in Britain have been following
thousands of children through their lives

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.594
as part of an incredible scientific study.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.171
There's nothing quite like it
anywhere else in the world.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.104
Collecting information
on thousands of children

00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:22.701
is a really powerful thing to do,

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:25.012
because it means we can compare
the ones who say,

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:28.446
do well at school or end up healthy
or happy or wealthy as adults,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.258
and the ones who struggle much more,

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:33.283
and then we can sift through
all the information we've collected

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:36.207
and try to work out why
their lives turned out different.

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.187
This British study --
it's actually a kind of crazy story.

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.616
So it all starts back in 1946,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.881
just a few months
after the end of the war,

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.336
when scientists wanted to know

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.155
what it was like for a woman
to have a baby at the time.

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:51.159
They carried out
this huge survey of mothers

00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:54.128
and ended up recording the birth
of nearly every baby

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:56.715
born in England, Scotland
and Wales in one week.

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:59.511
That was nearly 14,000 babies.

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:02.267
The questions they asked these women

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.753
are very different than the ones
we might ask today.

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:06.503
They sound really old-fashioned now.

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:07.862
They asked them things like,

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:09.092
"During pregnancy,

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.225
did you get your full extra ration
of a pint of milk a day?"

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:16.774
"How much did you spend
on smocks, corsets,

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:19.717
nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.405
And this is my favorite one:

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.681
"Who looked after your husband
while you were in bed with this baby?"

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:30.224
(Laughter)

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:33.643
Now, this wartime study
actually ended up being so successful

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.436
that scientists did it again.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.799
They recorded the births
of thousands of babies born in 1958

00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:40.747
and thousands more in 1970.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.098
They did it again in the early 1990s,

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:45.170
and again at the turn of the millennium.

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:48.860
Altogether, more than 70,000 children
have been involved in these studies

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:50.897
across those five generations.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.112
They're called the British birth cohorts,

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.899
and scientists have gone back
and recorded more information

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:58.272
on all of these people
every few years ever since.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:02.267
The amount of information
that's now been collected on these people

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.871
is just completely mind-boggling.

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:06.085
It includes thousands
of paper questionnaires

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.976
and terabytes' worth of computer data.

00:03:08.473 --> 00:03:11.299
Scientists have also built up
a huge bank of tissue samples,

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:15.803
which includes locks of hair,
nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:21.053
They've even collected 9,000 placentas
from some of the births,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:25.391
which are now pickled in plastic buckets
in a secure storage warehouse.

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:28.460
This whole project has become unique --

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:31.820
so, no other country in the world
is tracking generations of children

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.180
in quite this detail.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.800
These are some of the best-studied
people on the planet,

00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:39.928
and the data has become
incredibly valuable for scientists,

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.246
generating well over 6,000
academic papers and books.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.564
But today I want to focus
on just one finding --

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:51.922
perhaps the most important discovery
to come from this remarkable study.

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.284
And it's also the one
that spoke to me personally,

00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:57.622
because it's about how to use science
to do the best for our children.

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:01.385
So, let's get the bad news
out of the way first.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:05.261
Perhaps the biggest message
from this remarkable study is this:

00:04:06.137 --> 00:04:09.352
don't be born into poverty
or into disadvantage,

00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:10.590
because if you are,

00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.299
you're far more likely
to walk a difficult path in life.

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.985
Many children in this study
were born into poor families

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.336
or into working-class families that had
cramped homes or other problems,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.838
and it's clear now
that those disadvantaged children

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:26.954
have been more likely to struggle
on almost every score.

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:29.328
They've been more likely
to do worse at school,

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.107
to end up with worse jobs
and to earn less money.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.138
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.857
but some of the results
have been really surprising,

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.834
so children who had a tough start in life

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:41.362
are also more likely to end up
unhealthy as adults.

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.492
They're more likely to be overweight,

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.851
to have high blood pressure,

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.968
and then decades down the line,

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:51.365
more likely to have a failing memory,
poor health and even to die earlier.

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:56.690
Now, I talked about what happens later,

00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:00.031
but some of these differences emerge
at a really shockingly early age.

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:01.689
In one study,

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:03.608
children who were growing up in poverty

00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:07.493
were almost a year behind
the richer children on educational tests,

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:09.431
and that was by the age of just three.

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.357
These types of differences have been found
again and again across the generations.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:17.651
It means that our early circumstances
have a profound influence

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:20.320
on the way that the rest
of our lives play out.

00:05:20.344 --> 00:05:21.774
And working out why that is

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.618
is one of the most difficult questions
that we face today.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.490
So there we have it.

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:30.190
The first lesson for successful life,
everyone, is this:

00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:32.070
choose your parents very carefully.

00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:33.095
(Laughter)

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.171
Don't be born into a poor family
or into a struggling family.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:40.106
Now, I'm sure you can see
the small problem here.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.568
We can't choose our parents
or how much they earn,

00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:46.821
but this British study has also struck
a real note of optimism

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.196
by showing that not everyone
who has a disadvantaged start

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.815
ends up in difficult circumstances.

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.799
As you know, many people
have a tough start in life,

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.682
but they end up doing very well
on some measure nevertheless,

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.497
and this study starts to explain how.

00:06:01.337 --> 00:06:03.438
So the second lesson is this:

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.287
parents really matter.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.058
In this study,

00:06:07.082 --> 00:06:09.200
children who had engaged,
interested parents,

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:11.288
ones who had ambition for their future,

00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:14.146
were more likely to escape
from a difficult start.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.195
It seems that parents and what they do
are really, really important,

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.323
especially in the first few years of life.

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:22.595
Let me give you an example of that.

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:23.813
In one study,

00:06:23.837 --> 00:06:27.893
scientists looked at about 17,000 children
who were born in 1970.

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.726
They sifted all the mountains of data
that they had collected

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.977
to try to work out

00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:35.882
what allowed the children
who'd had a difficult start in life

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:38.029
to go on and do well
at school nevertheless.

00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:40.406
In other words, which ones beat the odds.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.177
The data showed that what mattered
more than anything else was parents.

00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:47.799
Having engaged, interested parents
in those first few years of life

00:06:47.823 --> 00:06:51.530
was strongly linked to children going on
to do well at school later on.

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:55.204
In fact, quite small things
that parents do

00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:57.706
are associated with good
outcomes for children.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.275
Talking and listening to a child,

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:02.203
responding to them warmly,

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.195
teaching them their letters and numbers,

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.891
taking them on trips and visits.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:08.932
Reading to children every day
seems to be really important, too.

00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:10.892
So in one study,

00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:14.203
children whose parents were reading
to them daily when they were five

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:17.276
and then showing an interest
in their education at the age of 10,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.321
were significantly less likely
to be in poverty at the age of 30

00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:23.937
than those whose parents
weren't doing those things.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.152
Now, there are huge challenges
with interpreting this type of science.

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:32.336
These studies show
that certain things that parents do

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.722
are correlated with good
outcomes for children,

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.159
but we don't necessarily know
those behaviors caused the good outcomes,

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:40.565
or whether some other factor
is getting in the way.

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:42.834
For example, we have to take
genes into account,

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:45.005
and that's a whole other talk in itself.

00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:47.712
But scientists working
with this British study

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:49.902
are working really hard to get at causes,

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:51.947
and this is one study I particularly love.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.153
In this one,

00:07:53.177 --> 00:07:56.044
they looked at the bedtime routines
of about 10,000 children

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:57.860
born at the turn of the millennium.

00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:00.213
Were the children going to bed
at regular times,

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:03.135
or did they go to bed
at different times during the week?

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:06.732
The data showed that those children
who were going to bed at different times

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:09.129
were more likely
to have behavioral problems,

00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:11.862
and then those that switched
to having regular bedtimes

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:14.272
often showed an improvement in behavior,

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:15.652
and that was really crucial,

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:17.948
because it suggested
it was the bedtime routines

00:08:17.972 --> 00:08:20.687
that were really helping things
get better for those kids.

00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.882
Here's another one to think about.

00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.064
In this one,

00:08:24.088 --> 00:08:26.979
scientists looked at children
who were reading for pleasure.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:31.056
That means that they picked up
a magazine, a picture book, a story book.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:34.579
The data showed that children
who were reading for pleasure

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:36.863
at the ages of five and 10

00:08:36.887 --> 00:08:39.783
were more likely to go on in school
better, on average,

00:08:39.807 --> 00:08:41.778
on school tests later in their lives.

00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:43.507
And not just tests of reading,

00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:45.671
but tests of spelling and maths as well.

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.315
This study tried to control
for all the confounding factors,

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:51.823
so it looked at children
who were equally intelligent

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.879
and from the same social-class background,

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:57.286
so it seemed as if it was the reading
which really helped those children

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.453
go on and score better on those
school tests later in their lives.

00:09:01.777 --> 00:09:02.927
Now at the start,

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:04.900
I said the first lesson from this study

00:09:04.924 --> 00:09:07.472
was not to be born into poverty
or into disadvantage,

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:11.048
because those children tend to follow
more difficult paths in their lives.

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:13.309
But then I said that parenting matters,

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.635
and that good parenting,
if you can call it that,

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:16.995
helps children beat the odds

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:19.822
and overcome some
of those early disadvantages.

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:21.171
So wait,

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:24.539
does that actually mean, then,
that poverty doesn't matter after all?

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:29.228
You could argue it doesn't matter
if a child is born poor --

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:32.973
as long as their parents are good parents,
they're going to do just fine.

00:09:32.997 --> 00:09:34.404
I don't believe that's true.

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.939
This study shows that poverty
and parenting matter.

00:09:37.438 --> 00:09:39.438
And one study actually
put figures on that,

00:09:39.462 --> 00:09:42.161
so it looked at children
growing up in persistent poverty

00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:44.254
and how well they were doing at school.

00:09:44.596 --> 00:09:45.747
The data showed

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.627
that even when their parents
were doing everything right --

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:49.953
putting them to bed on time

00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:52.414
and reading to them every day
and everything else --

00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:54.271
that only got those children so far.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.579
Good parenting only reduced
the educational gap

00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:00.616
between the rich and poor children
by about 50 percent.

00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:05.623
Now that means that poverty
leaves a really lasting scar,

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:09.029
and it means that if we really want
to ensure the success and well-being

00:10:09.053 --> 00:10:10.490
of the next generation,

00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:14.402
then tackling child poverty
is an incredibly important thing to do.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.270
Now, what does all this mean
for you and me?

00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:20.724
Are there lessons here
we can all take home and use?

00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:22.278
As a scientist and a journalist,

00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:24.850
I like to have some science
to inform my parenting ...

00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:28.669
and I can tell you that when
you're shouting at your kids

00:10:28.693 --> 00:10:29.953
to go to bed on time,

00:10:29.977 --> 00:10:33.009
it really helps to have
the scientific literature on your side.

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.052
(Laughter)

00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:35.679
And wouldn't it be great to think

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:38.412
that all we had to do to have
happy, successful children

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:41.135
was to talk to them,
be interested in their future,

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:43.733
put them to bed on time,
and give them a book to read?

00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:44.907
Our job would be done.

00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:46.838
Now, as you can imagine,

00:10:46.862 --> 00:10:50.071
the answers aren't quite
as simple as that.

00:10:50.095 --> 00:10:52.286
For one thing, this study
looks at what happens

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.731
to thousands and thousands
of children on average,

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.353
but that doesn't necessarily say
what will help my child or your child

00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:00.114
or any individual child.

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:03.346
In the end, each of our children
is going to walk their own path,

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.949
and that's partly defined
by the genes they inherit

00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:08.974
and of course all the experiences
they have through their lives,

00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:11.450
including their interactions
with us, their parents.

00:11:11.474 --> 00:11:13.929
I will tell you what I did
after I learned all this.

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:15.103
It's a bit embarrassing.

00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:18.425
I realized I was so busy working,

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:19.608
and ironically,

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:23.216
learning and writing about this incredible
study of British children,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.698
that there were days when I hardly
even spoke to my own British children.

00:11:27.446 --> 00:11:29.700
So at home, we introduced talking time,

00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:31.868
which is just 15 minutes
at the end of the day

00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:34.058
when we talk and listen to the boys.

00:11:34.707 --> 00:11:38.018
I try better now to ask them
what they did today,

00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:40.373
and to show that I value
what they do at school.

00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:43.627
Of course, I make sure
they always have a book to read.

00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:45.896
I tell them I'm ambitious
for their future,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.080
and I think they can be happy
and do great things.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.791
I don't know that any of that
will make a difference,

00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:55.205
but I'm pretty confident
it won't do them any harm,

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:56.960
and it might even do them some good.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:00.579
Ultimately, if we want happy children,

00:12:00.603 --> 00:12:02.643
all we can do is listen to the science,

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:03.833
and of course,

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:05.683
listen to our children themselves.

00:12:05.707 --> 00:12:06.861
Thank you.
