WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.760
We live in a time of fear,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.176
and our response to fear
can either be to contract

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.000
and attempt to guard ourselves

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.136
or to extend ourselves,
hold on to each other,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.920
and face our fears together.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600
What is your instinct?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.600
What do you see more of in the world?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.216
The problem with the first approach

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.576
is that in our mounting isolation,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.216
we divide ourselves from others.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.656
Our sense of isolation grows,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.816
because our imagination
goes into overdrive

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.376
about the people and the spaces
that we no longer engage with.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.840
Our sense of otherness grows,
and we lose empathy.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.976
Today I'm going to tell you
about a group of people

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.136
that took the global
challenge of terrorism

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.840
and began creating spaces
where strangers connect in solidarity.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.760
My own obsession with what I see
as irrational divisions began as a child.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.016
As a fourth-generation
Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.976
it bothered me that in four generations,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.056
there wasn't a single
marriage in my family

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.200
outside of my small religious community.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
And I wondered what that was about.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.376
Was it fear?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.720
Was it racism?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800
Was it cultural preservation?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.856
Did it have something
to do with colonialism?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.120
Certainly, we didn't share a lot
of the same public spaces with others.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.240
These divisions bothered me deeply,
and they drove my career choices.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.440
When I was 20, the US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.336
A year later, I was on my way
to the Middle East

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.840
to study conflict resolution.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.256
And then from that point on,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.816
it wasn't very hard for me
to find insecure environments to work in,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.696
because the world was quickly shifting

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.040
in what we now know
as the time of terrorism.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.176
I was in Washington, DC
when 9/11 happened,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.656
and then I moved back home
to Kenya to work with refugees

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.816
and then later worked in Pakistan

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
and in Afghanistan.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.776
In all of these places, what I noticed

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.336
was how important physical spaces are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.736
to making us feel safe

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.056
and well

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.280
and like we belong.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.280
In 2013, I came back home
to Nairobi from Afghanistan.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.776
Al-Shabaab operatives
had besieged Westgate shopping center,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
killing 67 people
in a day of utter horror.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.936
Soon after that,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.416
I could see how Nairobi
was beginning to change,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.376
and it was beginning to feel
more like the fear and terror-weary

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.920
and war-torn cities that I had worked in.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.560
And Nairobi continues to grow
in fear-driven ways.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.856
We see more walls, more barriers,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.120
more security.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.656
And like other parts of the world,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.840
we are experiencing
an erosion of human connection.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.416
Divisions along
religious lines are deepening,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.960
and we're doubting more and more
how much we have in common.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.896
We are at a pivotal time

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.456
when we need to restore
our confidence in humanity

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.360
and stand boldly and visibly together.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.656
So in 2014, I brought together
a group of people in Nairobi

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.920
to figure out what to do:

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.640
public intellectuals, diplomats,
artists, development workers.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.800
And the group articulated
our challenge as threefold:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.936
one, to reclaim the city
from the narrative of terrorism

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.176
and back into the hands
of the people that live there;

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.256
two, introduce a language
beyond race, tribe or religion

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.656
that would help us
transcend our differences;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.216
and three, provide a gesture
that would help restore empathy

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.600
and conversation and trust.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.496
One of the people in this group
was an artist and architect,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.200
Yazmany Arboleda.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.816
He and I have collaborated
in other parts of the world

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.416
over many years.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.976
He has a history

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.536
of disrupting urban environments

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.216
and making strangers connect

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.400
in incredible, beautiful
and spectacular ways.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.616
He had an idea.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.776
The idea was to unite people
of different faiths

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.976
by getting them to paint
each other's houses of worship,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.696
mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.656
paint them yellow

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.040
in the name of love.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.496
By focusing on icons of faith,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.576
we would get people to reexamine
the true essence of their faith,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.480
the common belief that we share
in kindness, generosity and friendship.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.816
By creating pathways
between houses of worship

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.456
within one neighborhood,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.376
we would create islands of stability

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.816
and networks of people

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.360
that could withstand threats.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.680
And neighbors, by picking up
a paintbrush with other neighbors,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.736
would engage not just with their heads

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.080
but with their hands
and with their hearts.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.456
And the painted buildings would become
sculptures in the landscape

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.136
that speak of people
from very different backgrounds

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.360
that stand together.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
We'd call the project "Colour in Faith."

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.456
We loved the idea and we immediately
began approaching houses of worship:

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.256
churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.936
Door to door, we went
to more than 60 rabbis,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.480
imams, pastors and priests.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.616
As you can imagine,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.336
bringing these communities together

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.576
when prejudices are reinforced
by a global pandemic of fear

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.856
is not easy.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.080
It was complicated.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.216
We were confronted
with the hierarchy of decision-making

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.920
within religious establishments.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.016
For example, with Catholic churches,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.336
we were told that the archbishop
would have to make the decision.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.456
And so we wrote a letter
to the archbishop.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.280
We wrote a letter to the Vatican.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.416
We're still waiting to hear back.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.296
(Laughter)

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.376
And with other houses of worship,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.576
we were told that the patrons,
the people that pay for the building

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.136
and the construction
and the painting of the buildings

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600
would have to make a decision.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.456
And then we came head-to-head

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.176
with the long legacy
of missionary and donor dependence

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.496
that so impedes
unconditional civic action,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.416
and we learned this the hard way.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.016
There was one community

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.376
that in our repeated conversations
would keep asking us

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
to appreciate them.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.776
And so we would keep going back

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.976
and telling them that we appreciate them,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.816
and of course,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.880
if we didn't appreciate them,
we wouldn't be here.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.576
And then we learned
painfully late in the game

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.160
that the word "appreciation"
is code for getting paid to participate.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.440
And so we challenged them

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.416
and we asked the question,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.680
"So what will it cost?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.240
How much could we pay you?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.480
And if we pay for your faith,
is it really faith?"

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.456
We started the project
asking the question,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.656
"Where does your faith live?"

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.936
And here we found ourselves
asking the question,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.680
"How much does your faith cost?"

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.160
But the most difficult issue
was the perceived risk of standing apart.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.576
We had one synagogue
that flat-out refused to participate

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.816
because it feared
drawing attention to itself

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.040
and becoming a target.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.240
Similarly, we had a mosque
that also feared becoming a target.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.480
And these fears are justified.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.640
And yet, there were 25 houses of worship
that pledged to participate.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.736
(Applause)

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.256
These bold leaders took the gesture
and reinforced it with their own meaning.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.240
For some, it was to tell the world
that they're not terrorists.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.000
For others, it was to welcome people
through their doors to ask questions.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.496
And for some, it was to bridge the gap

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.656
between the older
and the younger generation,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.176
which by the way is something that
many faiths are grappling with right now.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.016
And for some it was simply
to build neighborhood solidarity

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.240
in advance of feared election violence.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.416
When asked why yellow,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.696
one imam beautifully said,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.640
"Yellow is the color of the sun.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.936
The sun shines on us all equally.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.480
It does not discriminate."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.176
He and others spread the word
through their congregations

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.416
and over the radio.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.135
Municipal government officials
stepped forward and helped

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.336
with permits and with convening
civil society organizations.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.976
A paint company donated
a thousand liters of yellow paint

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.616
mixed especially for us
in what they now call "optimistic yellow."

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.936
(Laughter)

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.016
(Applause)

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.296
And a poetry collective
joined forces with a university

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.576
and hosted a series of tweet chats

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.776
that challenged the nation
on issues of faith,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.456
our faith not just
in the context of religion,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.176
but our faith in politicians
and tribe and nation,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.880
our faith in the older generation
and in the younger generation.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.216
And then Colour in Faith
was launched at a gallery event

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.736
that invited an incredible mix
of gallerygoers

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.560
and religious leaders
and artists and businesspeople.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.216
Already, even before
picking up a paintbrush,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.456
we had accomplished so much
of the conversation and connection

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.720
that we had hoped for.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.280
And then we began to paint.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.056
Muslims stood by Christians

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.296
and atheists and agnostics and Hindus

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.360
and painted a mosque yellow.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.800
And then they all came together again
and painted a church yellow,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.216
and then another mosque,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.480
and then another church.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Poets and musicians
performed while we painted.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.296
We painted in Nairobi,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.120
and then we painted in Mombasa.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.696
The local and international press
did features on Colour in Faith

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.736
in English and French and Swahili

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.720
and Spanish and Somali.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.440
CNN highlighted Colour in Faith
as a way of bringing communities together.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.376
And our social media platforms lit up,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.936
connecting more and more people.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.040
And these neighbors
continued to stay in touch.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.456
There are some that are pursuing
politics with a platform of peace,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.536
and we have communities
as far as Argentina and the US

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.816
and as close as Mali and Rwanda

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.656
that are asking for our help.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.240
And we would love to help.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.136
It's our dream that this project,
this idea, spreads across the world,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.800
with or without our support.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.040
Colour in Faith is literally highlighting
those who mean well in yellow.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.536
Colour in Faith is binding
neighborhoods together,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.056
and it's our hope
that when threats come knocking,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.456
they will collectively
sift fact from rumor

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160
and stand in solidarity.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.976
We've proven that the human family
can come together and send a message

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.376
far brighter and more powerful

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.240
than the voices of those
that wish to do us harm.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.016
Though fear is infectious,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.240
we are showing that so is hope.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.096
Thank you.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.240
(Applause)
