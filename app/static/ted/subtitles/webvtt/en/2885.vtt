WEBVTT

00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.716
So, I had been a photographer

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.174
for 18 years

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:07.592
before I began the Microsculpture Project.

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.994
And in that time,
I had shot global ad campaigns,

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:15.199
I had the opportunity to photograph
some of my generation's icons,

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:16.879
and I was traveling the world.

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:21.246
I got to a point in my career
that I dreamed of getting to,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.943
and yet, for some reason,
I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:29.156
Despite the extraordinary things
I was shooting and experiencing,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.080
they'd started to feel
a little bit ordinary to me.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:33.631
I was also getting concerned

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.781
about how disposable photography
had started to feel in the digital world,

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:41.664
and I really wanted to produce images
that had a sense of worth again.

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:44.087
And I needed a subject
that felt extraordinary.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:48.132
Sometimes I wish
I had the eyes of a child.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.700
And by that I mean,
I wish I could look at the world

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:52.977
in the same as I did
when I was a small boy.

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:55.542
I think there is a danger,
as we get older,

00:00:55.566 --> 00:01:00.645
that our curiosity becomes
slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.925
And as a visual creator,
one of the challenges for me

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.035
is to present the familiar
in a new and engaging way.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:11.304
Fortunately for me, though,
I've got two great kids

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:13.318
who are still curious about the world.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:19.111
Sebastian -- he's still curious
about the world, and in 2014, in spring,

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:21.992
he brought in a ground beetle
from the garden.

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.814
There was nothing particularly special
about this insect --

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.961
you know, it was a common species.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:28.335
But he was still curious,

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.767
and he brought it up to my office,

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.218
and we decided to look at it
under his microscope.

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:35.636
He had a little science kit for Christmas.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.667
And this is what we saw.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.397
Now, when I first saw this,
it blew me away.

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.458
Up here -- this is the back
of the ground beetle.

00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:47.026
When I first saw it,
it reminded me of a galaxy.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.401
And all the time, this had just
been outside our window.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.110
You know, I was looking
for this extraordinary subject,

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:56.637
and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity
to bring it in to me.

00:01:57.362 --> 00:02:01.239
So I decided to photograph it for him,
and this is what I produced.

00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:04.009
I basically asked myself
two simple questions.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.199
The first one:

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:09.041
Could I take all my knowledge and skill
of photographic lighting

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:12.195
and take that onto a subject
that's five millimeters long?

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.850
But also: Could I keep
creative control over that lighting

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.590
on a subject that size?

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:20.920
So I practiced
on some other found specimens,

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:24.470
and I approached the Oxford University
Museum of Natural History

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:27.306
to see if I could have access
to their collection,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.808
to progress the project.

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:31.246
And I went up there for a meeting,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.146
and I showed them some of the images
that I'd been shooting,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.291
and they could see
the kind of detail I was able to get.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.109
I don't think they'd ever really seen
anything quite like it before,

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.635
and from that point forward,
they gave me open access

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.973
to their entire collection

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.867
and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan,
their entomologist.

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.187
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:55.255
I shot 37 insects from their collection.

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:57.606
And the way I work

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.714
is that I essentially split the insect
up into multiple sections,

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:05.546
and I treat each one of those sections
like a small still life.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.290
So for example, if I was photographing
the eye of the insect,

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.102
which is normally quite smooth
and dome-shaped,

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:16.505
then I'd use a light source
that is large and soft and diffuse,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.870
so I don't get any harsh hot spots
on that surface.

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:23.962
But once my attention
turns over to a hairy leg,

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.559
that lighting setup
will change completely.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:30.220
And so I make that one tiny section
look as beautiful as I possibly can,

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:32.068
and I work my way across the insect

00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:34.864
until I have about 20 or 25
different sections.

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:40.105
The issue with photography
at high magnification

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.374
is that there is inherently
a very shallow depth of field.

00:03:43.398 --> 00:03:46.161
So to get around that, what I do is,

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.627
I put my camera on a rail

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.994
that I can automate
to move 10 microns in between each shot.

00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:53.673
That's about one-seventh the width
of a human hair.

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:58.304
And then that provides me
with a deep stack of images.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:01.389
Each has a tiny sliver of focus
all the way through.

00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:03.509
And I can squash that down

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:06.964
to produce one image
that is fully focused from front to back.

00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:10.533
So essentially, that gives me
25 sections that are fully focused

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:11.933
and beautifully lit.

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:14.688
Now, each one of my images

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:18.773
is made up of anywhere
between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.123
They take about three-and-a-half
weeks to create,

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:26.400
and the file sizes on average
are about four gigabytes.

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:29.543
So I've got plenty of information
to play with when I'm printing.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:33.217
And the prints at the exhibition
are around the three-meter mark.

00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.804
In fact, I had a show
in Milan two weeks ago,

00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:38.585
and we had some prints there
that were nine meters long.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:41.381
But, you know, I realize

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:44.313
that these images still have to work
in the digital world.

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:47.429
There's no point in me putting
all my blood, sweat and tears

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.604
into these pictures

00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:51.753
if they're only going to be showing
500 pixels on a screen.

00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:55.318
So with the help of Rob Chandler
and Will Cookson,

00:04:55.342 --> 00:04:57.136
we developed a website

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.965
that enables the viewer
to immerse themselves

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:02.014
into the full four-gigabyte files,

00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:05.068
and they can explore
all that microscopic detail.

00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:07.697
So if you have the time,
and I encourage you,

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.488
please visit microsculpture.net

00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:11.027
and go and have a play.

00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:12.209
It's good fun.

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:16.024
I first showed the work at Oxford,

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.972
and since then, it's moved on
to the Middle East.

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:22.117
It's now back in Europe
and goes to Copenhagen this month.

00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:24.322
And the feedback has been great.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:29.571
You know, I get emails, actually,
from all over the world --

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.750
from teachers, at the moment,
who are using the website in school.

00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:34.602
The kids are using them on the tablet.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.327
They're zooming into the pictures

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.578
and using it for art class, biology class.

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:40.750
And that's not something I planned.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:43.365
That's just a beautiful offshoot
of the project.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.018
In fact, one of the things
I like to do at the exhibitions

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.119
is actually look at
the kiddies' reactions.

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:51.866
And, you know, standing
in front of a three-meter insect,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.425
they could have been horrified.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.335
But they're not. They look in wonder.

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:58.805
This little chap here, he stood there
for five minutes, motionless.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.291
(Laughter)

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:04.228
And at the end of the day, actually,
at the end of the day at the exhibitions,

00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:07.273
we have to wipe down
the lower third of the big prints --

00:06:07.297 --> 00:06:08.296
(Laughter)

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.495
just to remove
all those sticky handprints,

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:13.335
because all they want to do
is touch those big bugs.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.910
I do want to leave you
with one final image, if that's OK.

00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:19.983
This has to do with Charles Darwin.

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:22.856
One of the recent images
that I photographed

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:24.814
was this one here.

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.708
I'm talking about the creature
in the box, not my cat.

00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.491
And this is a shield bug

00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:34.688
that Charles Darwin
brought back from Australia

00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:37.040
on the HMS Beagle in 1836.

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:39.701
And when I got it home,

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:42.594
I stood in my kitchen
and stared at it for about 20 minutes.

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:46.431
I couldn't believe I was in possession
of this beautiful creature.

00:06:46.455 --> 00:06:48.724
And at that moment, I kind of realized

00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:50.611
that this validated the project for me.

00:06:50.635 --> 00:06:54.113
The fact that the museum
was willing to risk me playing with this

00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:56.463
kind of showed me
that my images had worth --

00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:58.283
you know, they weren't disposable.

00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:00.849
That's the image that I produced.

00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:02.999
I often wonder, still,
when I look at this:

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.503
What would Charles Darwin
make of these images?

00:07:05.527 --> 00:07:09.125
Do you think he'd like his picture
of his shield bug? I hope so.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:10.313
So --

00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:14.789
(Applause)

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:16.760
You know, I think it's strange in a way.

00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:18.842
I'm a visual person,
I'm a creative person,

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:22.777
but I still needed the eyes of a child
to find my extraordinary subject.

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:24.828
That's the way it was.

00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:27.357
So all I can say is,
thank you very much, Sebastian;

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.606
I am very, very grateful.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.795
Thank you.

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.742
(Applause)
