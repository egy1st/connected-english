00:00:01.674 --> 00:00:06.014
A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:09.746
Einstein published
his theory of general relativity,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.004
which is sort of a strange name,

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.690
but it's a theory that explains gravity.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:19.713
It states that mass -- all matter,
the planets -- attracts mass,

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:24.351
not because of an instantaneous force,
as Newton claimed,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.338
but because all matter --
all of us, all the planets --

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.643
wrinkles the flexible fabric
of space-time.

00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:37.462
Space-time is this thing in which we live
and that connects us all.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.801
It's like when we lie down on a mattress
and distort its contour.

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:48.870
The masses move -- again,
not according to Newton's laws,

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.801
but because they see
this space-time curvature

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:55.648
and follow the little curves,

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.236
just like when our bedmate
nestles up to us

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.572
because of the mattress curvature.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.596
(Laughter)

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:07.785
A year later, in 1916,

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:12.200
Einstein derived from his theory

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:16.037
that gravitational waves existed,

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.196
and that these waves were produced
when masses move,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.025
like, for example, when two stars
revolve around one another

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.009
and create folds in space-time
which carry energy from the system,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.500
and the stars move toward each other.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:35.079
However, he also estimated

00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:39.855
that these effects were so minute,

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.455
that it would never be possible
to measure them.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:45.629
I'm going to tell you the story of how,

00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:52.113
with the work of hundreds of scientists
working in many countries

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:53.923
over the course of many decades,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.556
just recently, in 2015,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.653
we discovered those gravitational
waves for the first time.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:06.066
It's a rather long story.

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:12.042
It started 1.3 billion years ago.

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:15.550
A long, long time ago,

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:18.765
in a galaxy far, far away --

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.582
(Laughter)

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:26.225
two black holes were revolving
around one another --

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.137
"dancing the tango," I like to say.

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:30.712
It started slowly,

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.838
but as they emitted gravitational waves,

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.801
they grew closer together,
accelerating in speed,

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:40.424
until, when they were revolving
at almost the speed of light,

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:43.643
they fused into a single black hole

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.301
that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:51.827
but compressed
into the space of 360 kilometers.

00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.862
That's the size of the state of Louisiana,

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.146
where I live.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.265
This incredible effect
produced gravitational waves

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:08.298
that carried the news of this cosmic hug
to the rest of the universe.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:16.803
It took us a long time to figure out
the effects of these gravitational waves,

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:23.566
because the way we measure them
is by looking for effects in distances.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.706
We want to measure longitudes, distances.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.863
When these gravitational waves
passed by Earth,

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.887
which was in 2015,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.791
they produced changes in all distances --

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:40.431
the distances between all of you,
the distances between you and me,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:41.651
our heights --

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:45.325
every one of us
stretched and shrank a tiny bit.

00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:50.227
The prediction is that the effect
is proportional to the distance.

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:52.694
But it's very small:

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:57.576
even for distances much greater
than my slight height,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.935
the effect is infinitesimal.

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:05.941
For example, the distance
between the Earth and the Sun

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:10.413
changed by one atomic diameter.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.878
How can that be measured?

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:14.953
How could we measure it?

00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.929
Fifty years ago,

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.507
some visionary physicists
at Caltech and MIT --

00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:25.886
Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.956
thought they could precisely
measure distances

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.163
using lasers that measured
distances between mirrors

00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:37.614
kilometers apart.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:42.498
It took many years, a lot of work
and many scientists

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:45.757
to develop the technology
and develop the ideas.

00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:48.088
And 20 years later,

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:51.140
almost 30 years ago,

00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:57.177
they started to build two gravitational
wave detectors, two interferometers,

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:58.753
in the United States.

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.990
Each one is four kilometers long;

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:07.612
one is in Livingston, Louisiana,

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:09.886
in the middle of a beautiful forest,

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:14.420
and the other is in Hanford, Washington,

00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:16.230
in the middle of the desert.

00:05:17.094 --> 00:05:20.179
The interferometers have lasers

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:24.129
that travel from the center
through four kilometers in-vacuum,

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:26.994
are reflected in mirrors
and then they return.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:29.662
We measure the difference in the distances

00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:31.514
between this arm and this arm.

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:36.747
These detectors are very,
very, very sensitive;

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.211
they're the most precise
instruments in the world.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.706
Why did we make two?

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.329
It's because the signals
that we want to measure come from space,

00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:50.818
but the mirrors are moving all the time,

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:54.845
so in order to distinguish
the gravitational wave effects --

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.213
which are astrophysical effects
and should show up on the two detectors --

00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:02.078
we can distinguish them
from the local effects,

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:05.182
which appear separately,
either on one or the other.

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:10.075
In September of 2015,

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.068
we were finishing installing
the second-generation technology

00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:16.644
in the detectors,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.708
and we still weren't at the optimal
sensitivity that we wanted --

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:25.104
we're still not, even now,
two years later --

00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:27.655
but we wanted to gather data.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.695
We didn't think we'd see anything,

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.345
but we were getting ready to start
collecting a few months' worth of data.

00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:36.797
And then nature surprised us.

00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:41.737
On September 14, 2015,

00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:44.823
we saw, in both detectors,

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:47.026
a gravitational wave.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.522
In both detectors, we saw a signal

00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:52.558
with cycles that increased
in amplitude and frequency

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:53.835
and then go back down.

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:57.291
And they were the same in both detectors.

00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:59.315
They were gravitational waves.

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:05.225
And not only that --
in decoding this type of wave,

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:09.257
we were able to deduce
that they came from black holes

00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:11.274
fusing together to make one,

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:14.312
more than a billion years ago.

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:16.796
And that was --

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.379
(Applause)

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.339
that was fantastic.

00:07:26.994 --> 00:07:30.473
At first, we couldn't believe it.

00:07:30.497 --> 00:07:34.077
We didn't imagine
this would happen until much later;

00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:36.553
it was a surprise for all of us.

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:39.258
It took us months to convince
ourselves that it was true,

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:42.469
because we didn't want to leave
any room for error.

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:45.811
But it was true, and to clear up any doubt

00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:48.867
that the detectors
really could measure these things,

00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.785
in December of that same year,

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:53.689
we measured another gravitational wave,

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:55.128
smaller than the first one.

00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:58.965
The first gravitational wave
produced a difference in the distance

00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:01.613
of four-thousandths of a proton

00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.986
over four kilometers.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.504
Yes, the second detection was smaller,

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.797
but still very convincing
by our standards.

00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:17.588
Despite the fact that these are space-time
waves and not sound waves,

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:21.697
we like to put them into loudspeakers
and listen to them.

00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:25.049
We call this "the music of the universe."

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.592
I'd like you to listen
to the first two notes of that music.

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:33.362
(Chirping sound)

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.576
(Chirping sound)

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.466
The second, shorter sound
was the last fraction of a second

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.284
of the two black holes which,

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:48.238
in that fraction of a second,
emitted vast amounts of energy --

00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:54.913
so much energy, it was like three Suns
converting into energy,

00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:56.513
following that famous formula,

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:58.294
E = mc2.

00:08:58.318 --> 00:08:59.569
Remember that one?

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:06.007
We love this music so much
we actually dance to it.

00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:08.779
I'm going to have you listen again.

00:09:10.546 --> 00:09:13.225
(Chirping sound)

00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:16.056
(Chirping sound)

00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:19.303
It's the music of the universe!

00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:22.993
(Applause)

00:09:23.017 --> 00:09:26.139
People frequently ask me now:

00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:28.900
"What can gravitational waves
be used for?

00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:33.510
And now that you've discovered them,
what else is there left to do?"

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.217
What can gravitational waves
be used for?

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:42.352
When they asked Borges,
"What is the purpose of poetry?"

00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:44.217
he, in turn, answered,

00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:45.937
"What's the purpose of dawn?

00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:47.961
What's the purpose of caresses?

00:09:47.985 --> 00:09:49.985
What's the purpose
of the smell of coffee?"

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.424
He answered,

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:58.253
"The purpose of poetry is pleasure;
it's for emotion, it's for living."

00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:01.433
And understanding the universe,

00:10:01.457 --> 00:10:05.107
this human curiosity for knowing
how everything works,

00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:06.415
is similar.

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:12.636
Since time immemorial, humanity --
all of us, everyone, as kids --

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.529
when we look up at the sky
for the first time and see the stars,

00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:17.716
we wonder,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.220
"What are stars?"

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.571
That curiosity is what makes us human.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:26.292
And that's what we do with science.

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:33.616
We like to say that gravitational waves
now have a purpose,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.823
because we're opening up
a new way to explore the universe.

00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:41.618
Until now, we were able to see
the light of the stars

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.144
via electromagnetic waves.

00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:49.744
Now we can listen
to the sound of the universe,

00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:53.763
even of things that don't emit light,
like gravitational waves.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:56.931
(Applause)

00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:58.107
Thank you.

00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:01.532
(Applause)

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.556
But are they useful?

00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:08.848
Can't we derive any technology
from gravitational waves?

00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.016
Yes, probably.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.628
But it will probably take a lot of time.

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:16.316
We've developed
the technology to detect them,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.377
but in terms of the waves themselves,

00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:22.661
maybe we'll discover 100 years from now
that they are useful.

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:26.739
But it takes a lot of time
to derive technology from science,

00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:28.349
and that's not why we do it.

00:11:28.373 --> 00:11:30.648
All technology is derived from science,

00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:33.775
but we practice science for the enjoyment.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640
What's left to do?

00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:38.827
A lot.

00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.526
A lot; this is only the beginning.

00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:45.707
As we make the detectors
more and more sensitive --

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.648
and we have lots of work to do there --

00:11:47.672 --> 00:11:49.917
not only are we going to see
more black holes

00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:54.245
and be able to catalog
how many there are, where they are

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:55.841
and how big they are,

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:59.272
we'll also be able to see other objects.

00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:04.889
We'll see neutron stars fuse
and turn into black holes.

00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:07.512
We'll see a black holes being born.

00:12:07.536 --> 00:12:10.674
We'll be able to see
rotating stars in our galaxy

00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:12.906
produce sinusoidal waves.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:18.768
We'll be able to see
explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:22.991
We'll be seeing
a whole spectrum of new sources.

00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:25.042
We like to say

00:12:25.637 --> 00:12:29.238
that we've added a new sense
to the human body:

00:12:29.262 --> 00:12:30.960
now, in addition to seeing,

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.077
we're able to hear.

00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:36.648
This is a revolution in astronomy,

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:40.240
like when Galileo invented the telescope.

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:44.309
It's like when they added sound
to silent movies.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.836
This is just the beginning.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.012
We like to think

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:57.767
that the road to science is very long --
very fun, but very long --

00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:04.154
and that we, this large,
international community of scientists,

00:13:04.178 --> 00:13:06.738
working from many countries,
together as a team,

00:13:06.762 --> 00:13:09.445
are helping to build that road;

00:13:10.048 --> 00:13:13.838
that we're shedding light --
sometimes encountering detours --

00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:16.891
and building, perhaps,

00:13:16.915 --> 00:13:18.915
a highway to the universe.

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.106
Thank you.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.055
(Applause)
