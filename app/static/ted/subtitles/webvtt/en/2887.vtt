WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.536
I took a cell phone

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.216
and accidentally made myself famous.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.936
(Laughter)

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.576
I was just talking
about the things that I cared about,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.216
but with the click of a button

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.136
and an incendiary viral video

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000
I propelled myself into overnight stardom.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.136
When I say overnight,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.216
I mean I literally woke up
the next morning

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.536
with so many notifications on my phone,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.016
I thought I slept
through a national tragedy.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.576
(Laughter)

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.736
It was the craziest thing, guys,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.096
but when it came to my influence
and my exposure,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360
I literally took a quantum leap.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.056
So I made more videos

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.496
and the subject matter of my videos

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.856
was often the most divisive subject
in American life,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.416
but it was the way that I articulated race

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.800
that made me somewhat
of a digital lightning rod.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.576
See, being a survivor myself
of police brutality

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.896
and having lost a childhood friend,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.496
Alonzo Ashley,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.296
at the hands of the police,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.976
I had a little something
to say about the topic.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.376
You see, this was at the height
of the Black Lives Matter furor

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.656
and people seemed to be turning
to me to articulate their viewpoints,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.656
and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.336
You see, the internet
has this interesting quality.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.456
In one way, it totally
brought the world together,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.136
and I remember being a kid

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.336
and all of this utopian propaganda
was being dumped on us

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.176
about how the World Wide Web

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
was going to span the reaches
of people across the globe.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.656
But as it turns out, people are people.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.296
(Laughter)

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.176
And this magical superhighway

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.096
also took the demons of our nature

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.736
and gave them Ferraris.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.296
(Laughter)

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.016
You see, technology, y'all,
is a lot like money.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.616
It just brings out what's already
inside you and amplifies it.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.920
And so I soon became familiar
with the phenomenon of the internet troll.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.376
These guys seem to live
beneath the bridges

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.015
of said superhighway --

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.776
(Laughter)

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.000
And they also missed the memo about
the enlightenment of the internet age.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.816
I remember being called

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.656
highly colorful racial slurs

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.336
by those who use
the anonymity of the internet

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.040
as a Klan hood.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800
And some of them
were pretty creative, actually,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.456
but others were pretty wounding,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.256
especially navigating
the post-traumatic world

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.776
of a police brutality survivor

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.936
in the height of Black Lives Matter,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.936
with all of these people
being killed on my timeline.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.136
To these trolls, I wasn't a human.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.576
I was an idea, an object,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.976
a caricature.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.176
Did I mention that this race stuff
can be kind of divisive?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.056
You see, I'm an innately curious person

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.976
and as I drew my sword to engage
in epic battles in the comment section --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.320
(Laughter)

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.296
I also began to notice

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.776
that a few of my trolls
actually had brains,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.696
which made me even more curious
and what to understand them even further.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.736
And although these supposed morons

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.096
engaged in what appeared
to be original thought,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.976
I said to myself,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.696
"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.440
at least according to my knowledge."

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.536
Where are these guys
getting these arguments from?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.896
Like, was there some kind
of alternative universe

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.176
with alternative facts?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.176
(Laughter)

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.160
(Applause)

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.816
Was history and gravity
optional over there?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.040
I don't know.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.856
But I needed to know.
Like, I wanted to know.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.256
And as it turns out, I had no idea
about digital echo chambers.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.296
That same target marketing algorithm

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.976
that feeds you more
of the products you like to buy

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.096
also feeds you more
of the news that you like to hear.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.896
I had been living in an online universe

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.495
that just reflected
my worldview back to me.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.336
So my timeline was pretty liberal.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.216
I had no Breitbart
or Infowars or Fox News.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.680
No, no, I was all MSNBC
and The Daily Show,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.496
CNN and theGrio, right?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.376
Well, these trolls were hopping
the dimensional doorway

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.456
and I needed to figure out how.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.760
(Laughter)

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.296
So what I decided to do

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.696
was trick the Facebook algorithm

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.056
into feeding me more news
that I didn't necessarily agree with,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.896
and this worked fine for a while,
but it wasn't enough,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.376
because my online footprint

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.296
already established the patterns
that I like to hear.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.936
So with the anonymity of the internet,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.176
I went undercover.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.536
(Laughter)

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.320
I set up this ghost profile
and went crazy.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.136
Now, on a practical level,
it was very simple,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.936
but on an emotional level,
it was kind of daunting,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.376
especially with the racist vitriol
that I had experienced.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.856
But what I didn't realize
is that my trolls were inoculating me,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.496
thickening my skin,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.336
making me immune to viewpoints
that I didn't necessarily agree with,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.736
and so I didn't react to the same things
as I would have several months prior.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.416
All right? So I pressed on.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.296
Noticing that this stuff
also worked on YouTube,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.336
I became Lucius25,
white supremacist lurker --

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.360
(Laughter)

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.520
And digitally I began to infiltrate
the infamous alt-right movement.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.016
Now, my doppelgÃ¤nger

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.696
was Edgar Rice Burroughs'
John Carter character --

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.376
(Laughter)

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.480
a sci-fi hero who was once
a Confederate soldier.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.816
And to think, like, years ago,
I would have needed acting training

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.736
and, like, makeup and a fake ID.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.200
Now I could just lurk.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.576
And so I started

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.576
with a little Infowars,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.056
went on into some American Renaissance,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.336
National Vanguard Alliance,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.216
and, you know, I started
commenting on videos,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.000
talking bad about Al Sharpton
and Black Lives Matter.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.200
I started bemoaning race baiters
like Eric Holder and Barack Obama

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.976
and just mirroring
the antiblack sentiments

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.656
that were thrown at me.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.416
And to be honest,
it was kind of exhilarating.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.496
(Laughter)

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.736
Like, I would literally spend days
clicking through my new racist profile --

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.936
(Laughter)

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.176
Goofing off at work in Aryan land.
It was something else.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.336
(Laughter)

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.736
And so I then started
visiting some of the pages

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.696
of my former trolls,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.496
and a lot of these guys
were just regular Joes,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.296
a lot of outdoorsmen,
hunters, computer nerds,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.456
some of them family guys
with videos of their families.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.100
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all
could be in this room right now. Right?

00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:31.416
(Laughter)

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.536
But when I went undercover,
I found a lovely plethora of characters,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.576
luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos,
Richard Spencer and David Duke.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.936
All of these guys were
thought leaders in their own right,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.696
but over time, the alt-right movement
ended up using their information

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.376
to fuel their momentum.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.856
And I'm going to tell you what else
led to the momentum of the alt-right:

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.616
the left wing's wholesale demonization
of everything white and male.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.336
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver,
you're in league with Satan.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.360
(Laughter)

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.296
Now, would you believe,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.200
would you believe that some people
find that offensive?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.616
And --

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.776
(Laughter)

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.536
And so, I mean, listen,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.016
the fact is that millennials
get a lifetime of diet brand history.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.496
I mean, America seems to be hellbent
on filling its textbooks

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.816
with CliffsNotes versions
of its dark past.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.135
This severely, severely decontextualizes
race and the anger associated with it,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.336
and that is fertile ground
for alt-facts to grow.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.376
Add in the wild landscape of the internet

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.696
and it's easy to sell
rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.440
to a generation who has been
failed by public schools.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.056
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.936
Alt-facts have that quality.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.296
However, one theme kept screaming at me
through the subtext of those arguments,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.216
and that was,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.240
why should I be hated
for who I cannot help but be?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.336
Now, as a black man in America,
that resonated with me.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.376
I have spent so much time

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.216
defending myself
against attempts to demonize me

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.576
and make me apologize for who I am,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.816
trying to portray me
as something that I'm not,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.400
some kind of thug or gangster,
a menace to society.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.800
Unexpected compassion.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.776
Wow.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.336
Now, listen,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.936
the historical source of the demonization
of black males and white males

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.296
is highly different,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.816
and where you fall on this argument,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.200
sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.416
Now, you're probably surprised
by this perspective,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.640
and so was I.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.896
Never in a billion years did I think
that I could have some kind of compassion

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.480
for people who hated my guts.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.216
Now, mind you, not enough compassion
like I want to be friends.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.416
I don't have infinite olive branches
to extend to people

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.216
who, like, would not want
to see me on this planet. Right?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.016
But just enough compassion to understand
how they got to where they are.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.376
And to be honest,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.456
there were a couple of fair points.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.976
One of them was how liberals
have this wide acceptance for everybody

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.216
except for those with honestly held
conservative viewpoints.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.856
(Laughter)

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.320
Heaven forbid you love God,
this country and mean it. Right?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.336
And another thing that they talked about
was this fear that they had

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.456
of something that they labeled
as "white genocide,"

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.680
that diversity would be a force
that would wipe them out.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.576
Now listen, I know what it is to fear

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.216
for the fate of your people.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.176
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.376
mass incarceration,
gentrification, police shootings,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.360
black people have more
than enough reasons to stay up at night.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.816
But if nature is into diversity
and you are not,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.136
you're going to lose that fight, buddy.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.976
(Laughter)

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.120
(Applause)

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.416
You see, nature doesn't care
about your race. That's man-made.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.496
Nature just cares about healthy organisms,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.800
and your precious ethnic features
are expendable to that aim.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.056
So the moment that you let go
of that racist identity

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.896
and relatch onto humanity,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.456
all your problems go away.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.360
(Applause)

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.056
I'm going to tell you
what race ain't about to die out:

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.296
the human race.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.960
Join the party. The water's great.

00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:50.416
Until the water gets too hot,
but that's another TED Talk.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.200
(Laughter)

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.816
The point is that to get
to this point of understanding,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.616
you have to let go of that fear

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.336
and embrace your curiosity,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.816
and sadly, too many people
will not take that journey

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.856
to see the world from the other side.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.456
And, I mean, let's be honest,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.616
that doesn't just go for progressives,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.896
but also to the right wing
and conservatives.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.136
You know, as fair
as some of their points were,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.576
they were still trapped
in their own echo chambers,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.976
recycling old, outdated points of view,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.536
never getting a diversity in perspective,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.296
not making them well-rounded
in their worldview.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.136
So they're not hearing
certain anti-racist and political voices,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.136
voices like Tim Wise

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.616
and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy,
Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.576
All of these voices have the answers
to the questions that they want,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.416
but unfortunately they will not hear them
due to the power of these echo chambers.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.096
We have got to break out
of these digital divides,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.736
because as our technology advances,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.256
the consequences of our tribalism
become more dangerous.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.896
And this whole experience
taught me something:

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.760
our gadgets ain't going to save us.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.336
All these technological devices

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.056
are only mastery of the universe
out there, not the one in here.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.336
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.176
That's a dangerous imbalance.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.016
Where do you get
the emotional intelligence,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.896
the character development,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.616
the virtues of patience,
forbearance, compassion,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.816
you know, the things that make sure
that these devices, however advanced,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.760
become a blessing and not a curse?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
Seems to be me that humanity itself
needs an upgrade.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.936
Now --

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.816
(Applause)

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.496
That's a big task, understandably,

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.256
but I don't believe
in any kind of unbeatable monster.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.536
There was no giant out there
without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.896
And what if I told you

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.696
that one of the best ways
to actually overcome this

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.936
is to have courageous conversations

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.176
with difficult people,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.616
people who do not see the world
the same way that you see the world?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.496
Oh yes, folks, conversations may be
indeed the key to that upgrade,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.056
because remember,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.096
language was the first form
of virtual reality.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.216
It is literally a symbolic representation
of the physical world,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.296
and through this device,
we change the physical world.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.456
Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.616
conversations start countries,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.896
they build bridges,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.456
and when the chips are down,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.136
conversations are the last tools
that humans use

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.640
before they pick up their guns.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.096
And I ain't talking
about online safe conversations

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.736
from the security of your laptop.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.176
No.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.896
I'm talking about in-your-face
conversations with real, breathing people.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.136
And for me, this looks
like running a community forum

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.056
called Shop Talk Live.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.680
Now, in Shop Talk Live --
somebody's been there, right?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.616
In Shop Talk Live,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.096
we have the conversations
that change lives.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.896
We meet the community
right where they are,

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.336
and we've done everything
from divert gang violence in real time

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.016
to help find people jobs

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.176
to mentoring homeless youth.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.096
And the reason why we needed to do this

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.216
is because there was a severe lack
of trust in the black community

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.416
due to the violence of the crack era.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.696
And so we ended up taking
agency into our own hands,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.256
solving our own problems,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.336
not waiting for anybody else.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.576
And the truth is,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.976
from the mayor to the felon,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.176
you're going to find them
in that barber shop.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.216
And so what we did was just
organize what was already going on.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.976
And so what I started doing
was mining these alternative viewpoints

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.296
from these alternative digital universes,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.856
dissecting them, breaking them down
into controversial talking points.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.456
Then, with my cell phone,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.536
I flipped the internet against itself

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.296
and began to broadcast
these live conversations

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.016
to my online followers.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.056
This made them want to leave
the safety of their laptops

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.416
and meet us in person
to have real conversations

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.240
with real people in real life.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.176
And we did this. Thank you.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.880
(Applause)

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.656
Sometimes I sit back,
and I reflect on the paradox

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.896
of me just trying to solve the problems,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.936
us trying to solve the problems
in our own communities --

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.336
we build bridges
to so many other communities,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.976
from the LGBTQ community
to the Arab immigrant community

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.936
and even sat down with somebody
with a Confederate flag on their hat

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.656
and talked about the things
that actually matter.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.416
It is time that we stop trying

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.776
to hack our way
around the human experience.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.856
There is no way out of each other.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.216
Stop trying to find one.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.536
(Applause)

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.256
We have to understand something.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.416
Human beings all want the same things

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.136
and we have to go through
each other to get these things.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.816
These courageous conversations
are the way that these bridges are built.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.376
It's time that we start
seeing people as people

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.336
and not simply the ideas
that we project onto them or react to.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.056
Human beings are not the barriers

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.400
but the gateways
to the very things that we want.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.760
This is a collective
and conscious evolution.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.695
My journey began with
a terribly popular cell phone video

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.415
and a fallen friend.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.160
Your journey begins right about now.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.415
Join the renaissance in human connection.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.175
It is going to happen with or without you.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.096
My suggestion: pick a topic,
and start a community dialogue

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.936
in your neck of the woods.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.736
Meet folks back in real life.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.296
And I'm going to tell you,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.696
when you trick the algorithm
of your existence,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.160
you will get some diversified experiences.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.656
It is time to grow, people.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.616
And when we do this, not if,

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.176
it will be clear
that the key to this upgrade

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.136
was always our inner world,
not some device that we create,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.456
and the doorways
to this experience is now,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.256
and will forever be, each other.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.056
Thank you.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.080
(Applause)
