00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.416
For the last five years,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.600
I have documented the lives
of teenage mothers in Latin America.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.496
I started with a series of photographs

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.216
about the moment of birth

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.840
in my country, Uruguay.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.520
(Video) (Screaming)

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
(Grunting)

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.320
(Newborn crying)

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.256
I am the son of a teenage mother

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
and my sister became
a teenage mother when she was 16.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.336
I began exploring the theme

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.360
to better understand
myself and my origins.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.600
In developing countries,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.576
7.3 million girls under the age of 18

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.750
give birth each year.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.656
Projections suggest

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.376
that the teen pregnancy rate
in Latin America

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.416
will be the highest in the world

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.960
for the next 80 years.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.656
In Mexico, almost one in two
sexually active adolescents

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.760
get pregnant between the ages
of 12 to 19 years old.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.960
Teenage pregnancy
is not just about young pregnancies.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.616
It is about gender violence,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.360
physical, symbolic, psychological
and economic violence.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.016
Girls who become pregnant
before they are 18

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.640
rarely achieve an adequate
standard of living.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.696
The pattern of poverty

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.576
and limited access
to education and health care

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080
are a common thread
among teen pregnancies.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.376
If a girl in Latin America
gets pregnant before she is 16,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.856
the risk of maternal death
increases fourfold

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.720
over a woman in their 20s.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.120
And somehow, in spite of all this,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.896
motherhood also imparts a status

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760
and a respect to the adolescent
in her community.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.560
Her child becomes her life project.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.616
A high percentage of girls
under the age of 18 are single mothers,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.880
as was my mother.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.776
When I was learning to be a parent,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.176
I began to focus on the relationship
between father and child,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.920
a subject rarely given much attention.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.056
I wanted to highlight the ways

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.736
in which we need
to educate boys differently

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.840
without turning them into macho men.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.080
In some cases, families
send boys to school but not girls.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.656
The persistence of teen pregnancy
heightened the gender equity gap

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.880
and the continued existence
of traditional roles.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.296
If we were to allow
equal opportunities to girls,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.960
they could gain independence.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.976
Educating girls is key

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.840
to breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.816
Girls getting pregnant
between the ages of 10 to 14

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.616
are an extremely vulnerable population,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.240
and they can be easy prey
for men twice their age.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.296
There are many cases of violence,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.376
incest and sexual abuse

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.280
perpetrated against this group.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.016
This is Gloria.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.536
She became a teen mother at the age of 12,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.376
a result of the ongoing
abuse by her father,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.360
who was also raping Gloria's two sisters,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.880
ages 8 and 16.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.680
In this portrait,
she has butterflies in her hair,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.520
symbols of resurrection.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.440
For me, it's extremely important
to portray this mother with dignity.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.296
Pregnancies among girls
younger than 15 is a growing trend,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.856
not only in Latin America,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.920
but many developing
countries in the world.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.976
Our region is marred
by bad social and cultural inequalities,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.240
and teen pregnancy
further increases this divide.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.376
I am committing
to being part of the solution

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.256
by making work that implicitly
and emphatically

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.160
calls for human rights for girls.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.055
The day life projects
for boys and girls become similar,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.976
teenage pregnancy will decrease.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.216
Thank you.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.400
(Applause)
