00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:05.366
What are you doing on this stage

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.508
in front of all these people?

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:09.906
(Laughter)

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.081
Run!

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:12.108
(Laughter)

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:13.310
Run now.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.701
That's the voice of my anxiety talking.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.475
Even when there's absolutely
nothing wrong,

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.458
I sometimes get
this overwhelming sense of doom,

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.444
like danger is lurking
just around the corner.

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:31.173
You see, a few years ago,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.694
I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety

00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:34.868
and depression --

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.709
two conditions that often go hand in hand.

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:42.338
Now, there was a time
I wouldn't have told anybody,

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.822
especially not in front of a big audience.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:46.373
As a black woman,

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:50.037
I've had to develop
extraordinary resilience to succeed.

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.040
And like most people in my community,

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:55.872
I had the misconception that depression
was a sign of weakness,

00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.432
a character flaw.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.030
But I wasn't weak;

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:00.524
I was a high achiever.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.128
I'd earned a Master's degree
in Media Studies

00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:07.261
and had a string of high-profile jobs
in the film and television industries.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.784
I'd even won two Emmy Awards
for my hard work.

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:14.452
Sure, I was totally spent,

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:17.146
I lacked interest in things
I used to enjoy,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.468
barely ate,

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:20.395
struggled with insomnia

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:23.043
and felt isolated and depleted.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.914
But depressed?

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:26.462
No, not me.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.127
It took weeks before I could admit it,

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:31.580
but the doctor was right:

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:32.882
I was depressed.

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:36.959
Still, I didn't tell anybody
about my diagnosis.

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.135
I was too ashamed.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.676
I didn't think I had the right
to be depressed.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.048
I had a privileged life

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:47.172
with a loving family
and a successful career.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.300
And when I thought about
the unspeakable horrors

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:52.812
that my ancestors
had been through in this country

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.804
so that I could have it better,

00:01:54.828 --> 00:01:56.506
my shame grew even deeper.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.073
I was standing on their shoulders.

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:00.699
How could I let them down?

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.435
I would hold my head up,

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.819
put a smile on my face

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.551
and never tell a soul.

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:13.743
On July 4, 2013,

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.667
my world came crashing in on me.

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.300
That was the day I got
a phone call from my mom

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:24.514
telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,
Paul, had ended his life,

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:27.179
after years of battling
depression and anxiety.

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.823
There are no words that can describe
the devastation I felt.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:33.961
Paul and I were very close,

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:36.039
but I had no idea he was in so much pain.

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:40.254
Neither one of us had ever talked
to the other about our struggles.

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:42.442
The shame and stigma kept us both silent.

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:48.164
Now, my way of dealing with adversity
is to face it head on,

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:51.346
so I spent the next two years
researching depression and anxiety,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.137
and what I found was mind-blowing.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:56.738
The World Health Organization reports

00:02:56.762 --> 00:03:01.986
that depression is the leading cause
of sickness and disability

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.349
in the world.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.030
While the exact cause
of depression isn't clear,

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:10.152
research suggests
that most mental disorders develop,

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:11.903
at least in part,

00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:14.582
because of a chemical
imbalance in the brain,

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:18.508
and/or an underlying
genetic predisposition.

00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:21.202
So you can't just shake it off.

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.638
For black Americans,

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:28.718
stressors like racism
and socioeconomic disparities

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:33.782
put them at a 20 percent greater risk
of developing a mental disorder,

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:36.218
yet they seek mental health services

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.981
at about half the rate of white Americans.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:42.394
One reason is the stigma,

00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:48.635
with 63 percent of black Americans
mistaking depression for a weakness.

00:03:49.603 --> 00:03:53.861
Sadly, the suicide rate
among black children

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.572
has doubled in the past 20 years.

00:03:57.843 --> 00:04:00.048
Now, here's the good news:

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:04.885
seventy percent of people
struggling with depression will improve

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.266
with therapy, treatment and medication.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.120
Armed with this information,

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:12.851
I made a decision:

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:15.843
I wasn't going to be silent anymore.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.543
With my family's blessing,

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:20.460
I would share our story

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:23.298
in hopes of sparking
a national conversation.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.911
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.426
"Being strong is killing us."

00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:32.162
She's right.

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:36.208
We have got to retire
those tired, old narratives

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:37.787
of the strong black woman

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.021
and the super-masculine black man,

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.965
who, no matter how many times
they get knocked down,

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.224
just shake it off and soldier on.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.485
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.404
Feelings mean we're human.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.869
And when we deny our humanity,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.009
it leaves us feeling empty inside,

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:00.037
searching for ways to self-medicate
in order to fill the void.

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.330
My drug was high achievement.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.672
These days, I share my story openly,

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.906
and I ask others to share theirs, too.

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:11.854
I believe that's what it takes

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.473
to help people who may
be suffering in silence

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:16.706
to know that they are not alone

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.415
and to know that with help,

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.780
they can heal.

00:05:19.804 --> 00:05:21.969
Now, I still have my struggles,

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:24.281
particularly with the anxiety,

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:25.908
but I'm able to manage it

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:30.806
through daily mediation,
yoga and a relatively healthy diet.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.898
(Laughter)

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:34.144
If I feel like things
are starting to spiral,

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.212
I make an appointment to see my therapist,

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.299
a dynamic black woman
named Dawn Armstrong,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:41.296
who has a great sense of humor

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.557
and a familiarity that I find comforting.

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:46.764
I will always regret

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.456
that I couldn't be there for my nephew.

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.013
But my sincerest hope

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.766
is that I can inspire others
with the lesson that I've learned.

00:05:59.182 --> 00:06:01.652
Life is beautiful.

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.208
Sometimes it's messy,

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:06.166
and it's always unpredictable.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.237
But it will all be OK

00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:11.046
when you have your support system
to help you through it.

00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:13.934
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.664
you'll ask for a hand, too.

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:16.855
Thank you.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.761
(Applause)
