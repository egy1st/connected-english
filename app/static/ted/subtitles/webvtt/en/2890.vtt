00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.450
I'm going to begin today with a story

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:05.475
and end with a revolution.

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:06.834
(Laughter)

00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:08.025
Are you ready?

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.209
Audience: Yes!

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.138
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:13.144
All my life I wanted to be an actress.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:16.620
From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.644
and I wanted to be a part of it.

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:20.400
So, at the ripe age of 21,

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:23.026
I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.212
in New York City,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.404
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.719
as the next Meryl Streep.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.611
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:32.643
(Laughter)

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.324
Now, it's important for this story
that you understand

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:37.349
that I was raised by a raging feminist.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:39.279
I mean, just to give you some idea:

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.860
when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with "The Sound of Music,"

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.312
and running around, singing,
"I am 16 going on 17,"

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.908
all day every day,

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.641
my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.436
and she said, "OK, look.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.496
I'm not going to say
that you can't sing that song,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.075
but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.118
the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces."

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.220
(Laughter)

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:04.893
So that's where I come from.

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.284
So it just honestly never
even occurred to me

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:09.970
that I would be prevented
from doing anything in my life

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.354
because I'm a woman.

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:12.529
OK. So I graduate.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:15.327
And I start auditioning
and I get work, slowly.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.595
But I just start noticing
that the parts available for women

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.329
are terrible.

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:22.169
But, remember -- I came here

00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:25.579
to play smart, willful,
complicated, interesting

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:28.644
complex, confident
female characters, right?

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:30.148
Like Meryl.

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:31.580
And all of the sudden,

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:35.096
I am wrestling with 300 other
gorgeous, talented women

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.684
to play ...

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:38.708
"[Female] No dialogue.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.159
The character only needs
to stand on a balcony,

00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:43.821
look forlorn, and walk back
inside the house.

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.154
Only partial nudity."

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:46.910
(Laughter)

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.934
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.968
Attractive, cute, and flirty,
she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:54.545
throughout the entire film."

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.060
"[Mom] A proper Southern belle
who is making peace with the fact

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:02.059
that her only purpose in life
is to tend to her husband."

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:06.273
"[Abby] Must be OK
with a tastefully shot gang rape,

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.931
along with performing 19th-century dance."

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.144
(Laughter)

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:13.499
Those are actual casting notices.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.910
And so I just mentioned this
to my agent one day,

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.651
I say, "I feel like I'm not really
going in for parts

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.134
that I'm actually excited about playing.

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.473
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know
what to do with you.

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:26.996
You're too smart for the parts

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.200
that are being written
for women in their 20s,

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:31.839
and you're not quite pretty enough
to be the hot one,

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.863
so I think you'll work when you're 35."

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.318
(Laughter)

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:36.773
And I said, "Oh. That's funny.

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:39.810
I always thought that when you were 35,
you were kind of, like,

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.201
over the hill as an actress,

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.001
that you were relegated to playing
20-year-olds' mothers."

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.395
And he said, "Yeah --

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.419
(Laughter)

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.548
It's just the way it is."

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.345
So, maybe a year or so after this,

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.639
I'm having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.680
and we're talking about
how insane this is.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:00.209
And we decide, you know what? No problem.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.794
We'll just make our own movie.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:05.692
And I'll write and then I'll write it
about two complex female characters.

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:06.866
So we do.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.369
We set out to make this movie,

00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:11.879
and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:13.503
the writer, directors, producers,

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.087
and it's a film about two women.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.355
And so pretty soon,
we're sitting in the office

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.956
of a successful male producer,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.443
and he goes, "OK, girls.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.778
So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.697
a male producer onboard, right?

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:29.322
Just so that people
will trust you with their money."

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.294
Over and over again, people tell us,

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.301
"Yeah, but people don't really
want to see films about women,

00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:39.020
so maybe you should think about
making something else.

00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:40.813
It's just the way it is."

00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.895
So we make the movie, anyway.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.168
We scrape together 80,000 dollars,

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.572
and we make it, and it does so well.

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:51.865
It gets into tons of festivals
and we win a lot of awards

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.889
and it's big and exciting.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.737
But these experiences I've had
just keep rubbing at me.

00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.881
And so, I just start talking about them,

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.835
first, at Q and A's after
screenings of the film,

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.931
and then I get invited to be on panels
and talk at conferences.

00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.433
And the really amazing thing
is that, to begin with,

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.183
when I'm just talking to audiences

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:13.075
and other people, you know,
coming up in the film industry,

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.099
the universal reaction is,

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:18.106
"Oh my god! This is terrible.
What do we do about this?"

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:21.187
But the bigger panels I get on,

00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:23.909
suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.469
"Look, I totally agree
with everything you're saying.

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:29.331
You just need to be really careful
about where you say it."

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.661
An Oscar-winning producer tells me

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:35.298
that she doesn't think it's a good idea
to play the woman card.

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:36.868
It's just the way it is.

00:04:38.566 --> 00:04:42.421
And I think this is how
sexism continues on in 2016, right?

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:45.231
For the most part, it happens casually --

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:46.928
unconsciously, even.

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:49.548
It happens because people
are just trying to get along

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.097
within an existing system.

00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:54.443
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:57.493
to teach a young woman
the way that the world "just is."

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:01.017
The problem is that unless we do
something about it,

00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:03.430
that is the way the world will always be.

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:06.460
So why should you care about this?

00:05:06.484 --> 00:05:07.639
Right?

00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:10.898
I mean, we're facing some rather
significant problems in the world

00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:12.074
just at present,

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:14.437
what does it really matter
if I can't get a job,

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:16.784
or you're stuck watching
"Transformer 17," right?

00:05:16.808 --> 00:05:18.546
(Laughter)

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.887
Well, let me put it to you this way:

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.295
the year "Jaws" came out,

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.042
Americans suddenly started listing
"sharks" among their top 10 major fears.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.696
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
three million dollars

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.613
to have James Bond switch
from driving an Aston Martin

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:38.257
to a BMW Z3.

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:43.671
That one move caused so many people
to go out and buy that car,

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:48.780
that BMW made 240 million dollars
in pre-sales alone.

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:52.012
The year that "Brave"
and "Hunger Games" came out,

00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:55.453
female participation in archery
went up 105 percent.

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:58.365
(Laughter)

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.733
In fact, studies show

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:03.464
that the movies you watch
don't just affect your hobbies,

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:08.781
they affect your career choices,
your emotions, your sense of identity,

00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:12.789
your relationships, your mental health --
even your marital status.

00:06:13.924 --> 00:06:15.608
So now, consider this:

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.003
if you have watched
mostly American movies in your lifetime,

00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:24.951
95 percent of all the films
you have ever seen

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:26.722
were directed by men.

00:06:27.507 --> 00:06:31.165
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
of all of the leading characters

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.334
that you have ever seen

00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:34.778
were men.

00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:37.781
And even if we just talk about
the last five years,

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:41.878
55 percent of the time
that you have seen a woman in a movie,

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.519
she was naked or scantily clad.

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:47.362
That affects you.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.546
That affects all of us.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:52.986
We actually can't even imagine
how much it affects us,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.984
because this is all we've ever had.

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.547
Stories -- and movies
are just modern stories --

00:06:58.571 --> 00:06:59.834
are not frivolous.

00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:03.324
They're actually the mechanism
through which we process

00:07:03.348 --> 00:07:05.482
our experience of being alive.

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:08.175
They're the way
that we understand the world

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.631
and our place in it.

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:11.427
They're the way we develop empathy

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.418
for people who have experiences
different than our own.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.279
And right now, all of that
is being funneled at us

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:21.006
through the prism of this one perspective.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.926
It's not that it's a bad perspective,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.000
but don't we deserve to hear them all?

00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:29.217
How would the world be different
if all of the stories were told?

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:31.628
So what do we do about this?

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:34.771
This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:38.299
but a lot of us within the film industry
have spent years --

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.972
a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have --

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.632
giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:44.810
and doing studies,

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:48.903
and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.658
I mean, we have really yelled at them.

00:07:52.682 --> 00:07:56.681
And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:01.337
and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:04.780
not a single one
will be directed by a woman.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.590
So it is beginning to occur to me

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.617
that waiting for Hollywood
to grow a conscience

00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:14.700
may not actually be a winning strategy.

00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:16.601
In fact, it seems to me

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:19.508
that whenever there is a small,
ruling class of people

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:22.428
who have all of the money
and power and resources,

00:08:22.452 --> 00:08:25.291
they're not actually that excited
about giving it up.

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:28.653
And so you don't get change by asking them

00:08:28.677 --> 00:08:30.250
or even yelling at them.

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:32.827
You have to make that change happen

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:34.977
through a revolution.

00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:40.269
Now, please don't worry --
I promise you, here, now, today,

00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:42.293
our body count will be very low.

00:08:42.317 --> 00:08:44.546
(Laughter)

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.223
So, now before I get to my four-point
plan for the revolution --

00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:49.888
yes, I have a four-point plan --

00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:52.729
I have two pieces of very good
and important news for you.

00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:53.984
Good news number one:

00:08:54.008 --> 00:08:56.341
there are female filmmakers.

00:08:56.365 --> 00:08:57.618
(Cheers and applause)

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:59.069
Yes! I know!

00:08:59.093 --> 00:09:00.250
(Applause)

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:01.487
We exist!

00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:04.558
We actually graduate from film schools

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.905
at the same rate that men
do -- 50 percent.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.227
So here we have our 50 women.

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.438
The problem is that as soon as you get
to the micro-budget film,

00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:14.023
so even the very smallest films,

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:16.767
we're already only directing 18 percent.

00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:19.331
Then you get to slightly bigger films,

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:22.486
indies in the $1-5 million budget range,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.117
and we go down to 12 percent.

00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:26.644
So by the time you get
to the studio system,

00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:28.779
we're only directing
five percent of movies.

00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:33.051
Now, I know some of you out there
will look at this

00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:34.958
and secretly think to yourselves,

00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:37.941
"Well, maybe women
just aren't as good at directing movies."

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:40.742
And that's not a totally insane question.

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:44.123
I mean, we like to believe
the film industry is a meritocracy, right?

00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:45.432
(Laughs)

00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:47.503
(Laughter)

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:49.275
But look at this trajectory.

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:50.662
Either you have to accept

00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:54.937
that women are actually
five percent as talented as men,

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.119
which I don't,

00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:59.163
or you have to accept
that there are serious systemic issues

00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:02.000
preventing us from getting
from here to there.

00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:04.439
But the good news is, we exist,

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:07.898
and there is a vast amount
of untapped potential over here.

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:12.498
Good news number two,
and this is really good news:

00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:17.345
films by and about women make more money.

00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:20.493
Yes! Yes! It's true!

00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:21.853
(Cheers and applause)

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:23.521
It's true.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.864
The Washington Post
recently released a study

00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:30.696
showing that films that feature women
make 23 cents more on every dollar

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.166
than films that don't.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:35.070
Furthermore, my colleagues and I
commissioned a study

00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:38.230
comparing 1,700 films
made over the last five years

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:40.803
and, looking at the average
returns on investment --

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:42.850
so, how much money does that movie make --

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:46.224
comparing if a man or a woman
filled each of the following roles:

00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:49.313
director, producer,
screenwriter and lead actor.

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.561
And in every single category,

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.537
the return on investment is higher
if it's a woman.

00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.052
Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.475
Films by and about women make more money.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:06.869
And of course, at least
some portion of the male population

00:11:06.893 --> 00:11:08.108
does also like women --

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:11.257
(Laughter)

00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.243
so "women films" are not just for women.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.868
And yet, Hollywood only targets
18 percent of all of their films

00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:20.574
as "women films."

00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:24.668
So what you're left with
is a giant underserved audience

00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:27.057
and untapped profit potential.

00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:31.897
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.309
We have so many stories to tell.

00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:38.449
And despite everything we've heard:
you want to see them.

00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:43.103
The problem is, we've got this thing --
let's call it "Hollywood" --

00:11:43.127 --> 00:11:45.433
(Laughter)

00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:46.675
no, no, I'm just kidding;

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:49.006
I've met some very nice
people in Hollywood --

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.040
Hollywood, preventing us
from getting to you.

00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:54.352
So here is my four-point plan
for the revolution,

00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:57.746
and everybody -- man or woman,
in this room or anywhere in the world --

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:58.979
is going to get to help.

00:11:59.003 --> 00:12:01.619
And this revolution is not just for women.

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:03.825
Anyone who has been disenfranchised,

00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:06.205
anyone whose story has not been told,

00:12:06.784 --> 00:12:08.064
the same principles apply,

00:12:08.088 --> 00:12:10.694
and I really hope we can do
the revolution together.

00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:13.610
My four-point plan.

00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:16.967
Number one: watch movies.

00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:18.475
Isn't this a good revolution?

00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:19.569
(Laughter)

00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:22.152
OK, first I want to talk to anyone
who watches movies.

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:23.810
Who watches movies in here?

00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:24.985
Great!

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:29.014
Will you pledge to watch one film
by a female filmmaker per month?

00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:31.109
That's it, just start there. Great!

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:32.699
If you need help finding them,

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:35.660
you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:39.895
It's an easily searchable database
of films by women.

00:12:40.783 --> 00:12:43.115
And as you start watching all movies,

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:45.987
I just want you to pay attention
to the female characters.

00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:47.308
How many of them are there?

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:48.521
What are they wearing?

00:12:48.545 --> 00:12:50.000
Or not?

00:12:50.024 --> 00:12:51.476
Do they get to do cool things,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.159
or are they just there
to emotionally support the men?

00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:58.904
I'm telling you, once you see this,
you're not going to be able to unsee it.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:02.510
And as you start noticing this,
it's going to shift your viewing habits.

00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:05.772
And this already sizable market
is going to continue to grow.

00:13:06.455 --> 00:13:08.877
Step two: make movies.

00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:12.837
So now I'm talking to all
the female filmmakers out there:

00:13:12.861 --> 00:13:15.162
we need you to be very brave.

00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:17.996
It will be harder for you to make movies.

00:13:18.614 --> 00:13:21.987
In fact, there will be an entire industry
constantly telling you

00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:23.677
that your stories don't matter.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.280
And we need you to make them, anyway.

00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:30.708
That 18 percent in the micro-budget
range -- that is on us to fix.

00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.134
Don't wait for permission.

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:35.158
Don't wait for somebody to pick you,

00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:37.619
because 95 percent says
they are not going to.

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.424
Crowd fund.

00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:41.326
Write letters to eccentric relatives.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.716
I know how hard it is,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.428
but you have to make your movies --
now, today, features, not shorts.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:51.195
There is an audience for them,
and they want and need to see them.

00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:54.867
Three: invest in each other.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.858
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:01.945
on a system that does not want us.

00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:05.575
We need to find our audience
and invest in cultivating them.

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:07.832
If we can figure out
how to make our movies

00:14:07.856 --> 00:14:10.340
and deliver them
to the audiences that want them,

00:14:10.364 --> 00:14:11.524
that's it.

00:14:11.548 --> 00:14:12.913
That's the whole game.

00:14:12.937 --> 00:14:14.903
And whatever they're doing in the middle

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:17.198
is going to cease to be
quite so important.

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:19.682
Audiences, invest in us.

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:23.231
Help us make the movies
that you want to see.

00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:27.194
If you can give a female filmmaker
25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,

00:14:27.218 --> 00:14:28.494
great, do that.

00:14:28.518 --> 00:14:30.115
If you can invest more seriously

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:32.653
and help us over that critical
million-dollar hurdle,

00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:33.844
do that.

00:14:33.868 --> 00:14:36.607
But invest in seeing
the other half of the story.

00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:40.682
Four: disrupt through business.

00:14:41.352 --> 00:14:43.793
So now I'm talking
to all of the businesspeople

00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:45.125
and entrepreneurs.

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:47.563
This does not happen
very often in the world,

00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.183
but right here we have a golden situation

00:14:50.207 --> 00:14:53.028
in which you can enact
significant social change

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:55.052
while also making money.

00:14:56.274 --> 00:14:59.194
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.

00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:02.192
The old models of financing
and distribution are crumbling --

00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:04.269
please come in and disrupt it.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:06.594
I'll give you an example.

00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:08.568
Right now, with some incredible women,

00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:10.781
I am launching the "The 51 Fund."

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:12.288
It's a venture capital fund

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:15.639
that will finance films written, directed
and produced by women

00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:18.351
in that critical $1-5 million range.

00:15:19.057 --> 00:15:21.756
We will give a significant number
of female filmmakers

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.315
the chance to make their movies

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:26.074
and we will deliver them
to the audiences who want them.

00:15:26.098 --> 00:15:28.712
Good for equality, good for business.

00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:31.885
But that's only one example, we need more.

00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:34.020
There is room for so many more.

00:15:34.044 --> 00:15:35.398
So I say to you:

00:15:35.422 --> 00:15:37.627
Hollywood is leaving money on the table.

00:15:38.073 --> 00:15:39.378
Come pick it up.

00:15:40.361 --> 00:15:44.743
(Applause)

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:48.797
Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
but it is actually so doable.

00:15:48.821 --> 00:15:52.464
Entrenched systems don't change
because you ask the people in charge,

00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:55.724
they change because all of the people
who don't have what they want

00:15:55.748 --> 00:15:57.827
rise up and make that change happen.

00:15:58.391 --> 00:15:59.862
And don't you want to?

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.631
I want to see what the other
51 percent of the population has to say.

00:16:05.337 --> 00:16:07.730
I want to watch movies
that teach me about people

00:16:07.754 --> 00:16:09.141
who are different than I am.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.698
I want to see women's bodies on film
that aren't perfect.

00:16:14.237 --> 00:16:16.500
I want to give our little boys the chance

00:16:16.524 --> 00:16:18.383
to empathize with female characters

00:16:18.407 --> 00:16:20.738
so that they can become more whole men.

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:23.510
And I definitely want
to give a little girl

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.491
who may not have a real-life role model

00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:26.875
the chance to watch movies

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:29.672
and see women doing everything
she dreams of achieving.

00:16:30.528 --> 00:16:33.217
This is not about
making one industry better.

00:16:33.724 --> 00:16:35.724
This is about making a better world.

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:37.778
Will you help?

00:16:38.905 --> 00:16:40.645
The time for waiting is over.

00:16:40.669 --> 00:16:42.915
The time for the revolution is now.

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:47.658
(Cheers and applause)
