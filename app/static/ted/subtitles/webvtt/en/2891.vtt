00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:06.534
Some months back,
I was visiting this East African city,

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:09.547
and we were stuck in traffic.

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.613
And this vendor suddenly
approaches my window

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:15.180
with a half-opened alphabet sheet.

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:19.324
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:20.783
and I thought of my daughter,

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:23.369
how it would be nice
to spread it on the floor

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:25.233
and just play all over it with her

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.446
while getting her to learn the alphabet.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.765
So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.788
and we moved on.

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:37.266
When I had time to fully open
the alphabet sheet

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.619
and take a more detailed look at it,

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:42.666
I knew I was not going to use that
to teach my daughter.

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:44.784
I regretted my purchase.

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.673
Why so?

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:51.124
Looking at the alphabet sheet
reminded me of the fact

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.524
that not much has changed

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:55.971
in the education curricula in Africa.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.449
Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:03.569
And because of that,
I struggled for years.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.960
I struggled to reconcile my reality
with the formal education I received

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:11.131
in school, in the schools I attended.

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.602
I had identity crises.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.535
I looked down on my reality.

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:21.805
I looked at my ancestry,
I looked at my lineage with disrespect.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:27.258
I had very little patience
for what my life had to offer around me.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.444
Why?

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:32.915
"A is for apple."

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:35.845
"A is for apple."

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:42.216
"A is for apple" is for that child
in that part of the world

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.972
where apples grow out;

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.727
who has an apple in her lunch bag;

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:51.637
who goes to the grocery store
with her mom and sees red,

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:55.314
green, yellow -- apples
of all shapes and colors and sizes.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.938
And so, introducing
education to this child

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:01.084
with an alphabet sheet like this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.131
fulfills one of the major
functions of education,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.317
which is to introduce the learner

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.714
to an appreciation
of the learner's environment

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:16.380
and a curiosity to explore more
in order to add value.

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:18.992
In my own case,

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.326
when and where I grew up in Africa,

00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:25.443
apple was an exotic fruit.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.104
Two or three times a year,

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:33.495
I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.416
signifying thousands of miles traveled --
warehouses storing --

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.614
to get to me.

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:41.486
I grew up in the city

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.510
to very financially comfortable parents,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:46.476
so it was my dignified reality,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.811
exactly the same way

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.997
cassava fufu or ugali
would not regularly feature

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.922
in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,

00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.280
apples didn't count as part of my reality.

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:03.256
So what this did to me,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.964
introducing education to me
with "A is for apple,"

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:09.447
made education an abstraction.

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:11.783
It made it something out of my reach --

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.571
a foreign concept,

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:18.401
a phenomenon for which I would have
to constantly and perpetually seek

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:20.236
the validation of those it belonged to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.200
for me to make progress
within it and with it.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.015
That was tough for a child;
it would be tough for anyone.

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.765
As I grew up and I advanced academically,

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:35.853
my reality was further separated
from my education.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.485
In history, I was taught

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.760
that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
discovered the Niger River.

00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.424
And so it bothered me.

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.463
My great-great-grandparents grew up

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.490
quite close to the edge
of the Niger River.

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:51.933
(Laughter)

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:58.434
And it took someone to travel
thousands of miles from Europe

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.905
to discover a river
right under their nose?

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:03.370
(Laughter)

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:04.551
No!

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:09.994
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:11.947
What did they do with their time?

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:13.868
(Laughter)

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:16.723
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:18.127
fighting tribal wars?

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:23.417
I mean, I just knew my education
was preparing me to go somewhere else

00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:27.208
and practice and give to another
environment that it belonged to.

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.415
It was not for my environment,
where and when I grew up.

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.188
And this continued.

00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:34.105
This philosophy undergirded my studies

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.594
all through the time I studied in Africa.

00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:40.452
It took a lot of experiences
and some studies

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:43.628
for me to begin to have
a change of mindset.

00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:46.616
I will share a couple
of the remarkable ones with us.

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:50.090
I was in the United States
in Washington, DC

00:04:50.114 --> 00:04:52.156
studying towards my doctorate,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.057
and I got this consultancy position
with the World Bank Africa Region.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:59.491
And so I remember one day,

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:04.163
my boss -- we were having
a conversation on some project,

00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:07.228
and he mentioned a particular
World Bank project,

00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:12.224
a large-scale irrigation project
that cost millions of dollars

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:13.579
in Niger Republic

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:16.877
that was faltering sustainably.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.244
He said this project
wasn't so sustainable,

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:23.491
and it bothered those
that instituted the whole package.

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:26.824
But then he mentioned
a particular project,

00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:32.434
a particular traditional irrigation method
that was hugely successful

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:36.155
in the same Niger Republic
where the World Bank project was failing.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.426
And that got me thinking.

00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.024
So I did further research,

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:44.369
and I found out about Tassa.

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:49.545
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.762
where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide
and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:58.660
are dug across a field to be cultivated.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.333
Then, a small dam is constructed
around the field,

00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:07.922
and then crops are planted
across the surface area.

00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:11.250
What happens is that when rain falls,

00:06:11.274 --> 00:06:14.258
the holes are able to store the water

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:18.100
and appropriate it to the extent
that the plant needs the water.

00:06:18.124 --> 00:06:21.390
The plant can only assimilate
as much water as needed

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.984
until harvest time.

00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:28.275
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.992
so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.824
and it has been used for centuries.

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:35.486
In an experiment that was conducted,

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:41.646
two similar plots of land
were used in the experiment,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.301
and one plot of land

00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:46.267
did not have the Tassa technique on it.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.458
Similar plots.

00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:50.640
The other one had Tassa technique
constructed on it.

00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:55.087
Then similar grains of millet
also were planted on both plots.

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:58.252
During harvest time,

00:06:58.276 --> 00:07:01.428
the plot of land without Tassa technique

00:07:01.452 --> 00:07:05.623
yielded 11 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

00:07:06.737 --> 00:07:09.032
The plot of land with Tassa technique

00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:14.909
yielded 553 kilograms
of millet per hectare.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.245
(Applause)

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:22.182
I looked at the research,
and I looked at myself.

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:25.458
I said, "I studied
agriculture for 12 years,

00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:28.892
from primary to Senior Six,
as we say in East Africa,

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:31.262
SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.

00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:32.943
No one ever taught me

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:36.773
of any form of traditional
African knowledge of cultivation --

00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:38.591
of harvesting, of anything --

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:42.443
that will work in modern times
and actually succeed,

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:47.068
where something imported from the West
would struggle to succeed.

00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:50.888
That was when I knew the challenge,

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:53.491
the challenge of Africa's curricula,

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:58.447
And I thus began my quest
to dedicate my life, concern my life work,

00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:02.763
to studying, conducting research
on Africa's own knowledge system

00:08:02.787 --> 00:08:05.787
and being able to advocate
for its mainstreaming

00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.658
in education, in research, policy

00:08:08.682 --> 00:08:10.737
across sectors and industries.

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:15.289
Another conversation
and experience I had at the bank

00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:20.063
I guess made me take that final decision
of where I was going to go,

00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:24.111
even though it wasn't the most lucrative
research to go into,

00:08:24.135 --> 00:08:26.452
but it was just about what I believed in.

00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:31.563
And so one day, my boss said
that he likes to go to Africa

00:08:31.587 --> 00:08:36.123
to negotiate World Bank loans
and to work on World Bank projects.

00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:38.563
And I was intrigued. I asked him why.

00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:41.033
He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa,

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:42.766
it's so easy.

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:47.913
I just write up my loan documents
and my project proposal in Washington, DC,

00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:50.890
I go to Africa, and they all
just get signed.

00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:54.302
I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.

00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:56.533
My bosses are happy with me."

00:08:56.933 --> 00:09:00.620
But then he said,
"I hate going to Asia or ..."

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:04.087
and he mentioned a particular country,
Asia and some of these countries.

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.134
"They keep me for this, trying
to get the best deal for their countries.

00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:09.334
They get the best deal.

00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:12.266
They tell me, 'Oh,
that clause will not work for us

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.897
in our environment.

00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:16.894
It's not our reality.
It's just so Western.'

00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:20.029
And they tell me, 'Oh,
we have enough experts

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:21.256
to take care of this.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.901
You don't have enough experts.

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:24.078
We know our aim.'

00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:26.547
And they just keep going
through all these things.

00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:29.091
By the time they finish,
yes, they get the best deal,

00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:32.280
but I'm so exhausted and I don't get
the best deal for the bank,

00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:33.483
and we're in business."

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.302
"Really?" I thought in my head, "OK."

00:09:35.326 --> 00:09:39.606
I was privileged to sit in on
a loan negotiating session

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.295
in an African country.

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:44.139
So I would do these consultancy
positions during summer,

00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:46.847
you know, since I was a doctoral student.

00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:51.203
And then I traveled with the team,
with the World Bank team,

00:09:51.227 --> 00:09:55.543
as more like someone to help out
with organizational matters.

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:58.834
But I sat in during
the negotiating session.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.662
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
with me from Washington, DC.

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:09.536
And I looked across the table
at my African brothers and sisters.

00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.327
I could see intimidation on their faces.

00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:15.034
They didn't believe
they had anything to offer

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:17.346
the great-great-grandchildren
of Mungo Park --

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.987
the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple."

00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.787
They just sat and watched:
"Oh, just give us, let us sign.

00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:24.724
You own the knowledge. You know it all.

00:10:24.748 --> 00:10:26.957
Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign."

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:30.017
They had no voice.
They didn't believe in themselves.

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:35.727
Excuse me.

00:10:36.587 --> 00:10:37.759
And so,

00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:41.538
I have been doing this for a decade.

00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:45.006
I have been conducting research
on Africa's knowledge system,

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.274
original, authentic,
traditional knowledge.

00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:50.495
In the few cases where this
has been implemented in Africa,

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.003
there has been remarkable
successes recorded.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.564
I think of Gacaca.

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:59.988
Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional
judicial system

00:11:00.012 --> 00:11:02.106
that was used after the genocide.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.561
In 1994, when the genocide ended,

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.662
Rwanda's national court system
was in shambles:

00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:14.212
no judges, no lawyers to try
hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:17.744
So the government of Rwanda
came up with this idea

00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:21.163
to resuscitate a traditional
judicial system known as Gacaca.

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:25.072
Gacaca is a community-based
judicial system,

00:11:25.096 --> 00:11:28.033
where community members come together

00:11:28.057 --> 00:11:31.806
to elect men and women of proven integrity

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.340
to try cases of crimes committed
within these communities.

00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:42.732
So by the time Gacaca concluded
its trial of genocide cases in 2012,

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:50.594
12,000 community-based courts
had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:52.686
That's a record.

00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:58.150
(Applause)

00:11:58.438 --> 00:12:04.038
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
Rwanda's traditional philosophy

00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:07.155
of reconciliation and reintegration,

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:11.057
as against the whole
punitive and banishment idea

00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.803
that undergirds present-day Western style.

00:12:15.481 --> 00:12:19.376
And not to compare, but just to say
that it really emphasized

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.754
Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.866
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.631
former president of Tanzania --

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:29.131
(Applause)

00:12:29.155 --> 00:12:32.331
who said that you cannot develop people.

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:35.974
People will have to develop themselves.

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:37.948
I agree with Mwalimu.

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:39.875
I am convinced

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:43.522
that Africa's further transformation,
Africa's advancement,

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:48.325
rests simply in the acknowledgment,
validation and mainstreaming

00:12:48.349 --> 00:12:53.338
of Africa's own traditional, authentic,
original, indigenous knowledge

00:12:53.362 --> 00:12:58.233
in education, in research,
in policy making and across sectors.

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.333
This is not going to be easy for Africa.

00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:04.821
It is not going to be easy for a people
used to being told how to think,

00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:07.210
what to do, how to go about it,

00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:10.388
a people long subjected
to the intellectual guidance

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.154
and direction of others,

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:13.845
be they the colonial masters,

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:16.841
aid industry or international news media.

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:20.099
But it is a task that we have to do
to make progress.

00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:23.023
I am strengthened by the words
of Joseph Shabalala,

00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:26.521
founder of the South African choral group
Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:32.232
He said that the task ahead of us
can never, ever be greater

00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:34.409
than the power within us.

00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:35.591
We can do it.

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.175
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:42.394
We can learn to place value
on our reality and our knowledge.

00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:43.573
Thank you.

00:13:43.597 --> 00:13:45.068
(Swahili) Thank you very much.

00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.615
(Applause)

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.841
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:53.564
(Applause)
