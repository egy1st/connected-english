00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.536
"Robam kbach boran,"

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.336
or the art of Khmer classical dance,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.160
is more than 1,000 years old.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.576
It was developed as a prayer in movement

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.776
for rain and fertility,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.200
and a prosperity that this meant
for an agricultural society.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.736
Dancers who were both men and women

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.016
were offered to temples

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.120
where they served as living bridges
between heaven and earth.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.736
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers
of the people up to the gods,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.136
and the will of the deities
was delivered back through them

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.680
to the people and the land.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.520
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.960
Our backs are arched,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.656
our knees are bent,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.696
our toes are curled,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.056
our elbows are hyperflexed

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.520
and our fingers are curved backwards.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.256
All of these curves
create a serpentine impression,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.056
and this is important because before
the introduction of major religions,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.840
Khmers, and people all over the world
practiced animism.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.016
Serpents were especially important
in this belief system

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.416
because in their fluid,
curvilinear movement,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.080
they mimicked the flow of water.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.056
So to invoke the serpent
in your dancing body then

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.840
was to conjure the image
of rivers cutting across the earth:

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.640
inspire the flow of life-giving waters.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.736
As you can see then,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.176
Khmer classical dance
is a transformation of nature,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.320
of both the physical world around us
and of our own internal universe.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.256
We have four primary
hand gestures that we use.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.480
Can we do them together?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.000
Yeah? OK.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.960
This is a tree.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200
That tree will grow,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.520
and then it will have leaves.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.136
After it has leaves,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.880
it'll have flowers,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.256
and after it has flowers,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.000
it'll have fruit.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.216
That fruit will drop

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.256
and a new tree will grow.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.336
And in those four gestures

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.960
is the cycle of life.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.536
These four gestures are then used

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.216
to create a whole entire language
with which dancers express themselves.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.536
So for example,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.896
I can say,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.120
"I."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
"I."

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.120
In dance that would be ...

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.296
"I."

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.520
Or I can say ...

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.376
"Hey you, come here, come here."

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.600
In dance ...

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.696
"Come here,"

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.616
or, "Go, go."

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.840
(Laughter)

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.296
"Go."

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.560
And everything from ...

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.480
love ...

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560
to sadness,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.696
to --

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.736
(Stomping)

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.096
anger

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360
can be expressed
through the dance as well.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.816
There's a certain magic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.976
in the way that things are filtered,
transformed and put together

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.640
to create limitless possibilities in art.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.336
The Khmer word for art,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.576
silapak,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.200
in fact, at its root, means "magic."

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.536
The artist --

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.056
the silapakar,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.496
or the silapakarani, then,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.680
is nothing short of a magician.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.296
I am very proud to say

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.336
that I belong to a long line of magicians,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.640
from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.520
to her teachers who were stars
in the royal palace,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.136
to the ancient dancers of Angkor

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.696
and to the primal villagers

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.280
from which the art form
originally took life.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.696
That said,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.480
our cherished heritage was once
almost completely destroyed.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.536
If you are wearing glasses,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.760
please stand up.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.136
If you speak more than one language,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.360
please stand up.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.896
If you have light skin,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.120
please stand up.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.040
Your glasses meant
that you could afford health care.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.440
That second or third language you spoke
indicated your elite education.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.720
Your light skin meant
you didn't have to work beneath the sun.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.576
Under the Khmer Rouge,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.936
who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.136
we would all be dead now,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.040
targeted because of our assumed privilege.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.376
You see,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.536
the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.176
and they saw centuries
of rigid inequality.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.376
The king and the few elites around him

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.256
had all the pleasures
and comforts of the world

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.496
while the mass majority
suffered from backbreaking labor

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.760
and harsh poverty.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.360
You don't need a history book
to see that this is true.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.336
The Khmer word for "I,"

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.560
for "me,"

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.840
is khnhom.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.936
This very same word can also mean "slave"

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.696
and dancers were in fact known
as knhom preah robam,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.320
or "slaves of the sacred dance."

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.256
The Khmer Rouge sought
to end slavery in Cambodia,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.760
yet somehow they turned
everyone into slaves to do it.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400
They became the oppression
that they sought to end.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.056
They evacuated the capital

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.576
and forced people into labor camps.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.496
They tore families apart

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.280
and brainwashed children
against their own parents.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.336
Everywhere, people were dying
and being killed,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.416
losing their lives from disease,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.656
overwork,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680
execution and starvation.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.336
The result of this is that an entire third
of Cambodia's population was lost

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.176
in less than four years,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.040
and in that number were 90 percent
of Khmer dance artists.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.496
In other words,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.120
nine out of 10 visions
for the tradition and future were lost.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.456
Thankfully, however,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.536
it was my teacher's teachers,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.296
Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.376
who would lead the revival of the art form

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.640
from the ashes of war and genocide:

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.296
one student,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.896
one gesture,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.896
one dance at a time.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.816
They wrote the love,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.296
magic,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.536
beauty,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.896
history and philosophy of our lineage

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.400
into the bodies of the next generation.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.536
Nearly 40 years later,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.080
Khmer classical dance
has been revived to new heights.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.640
Yet somehow it still exists
in a vulnerable environment.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.816
The disastrous effects of war
still haunt Khmer people today.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.936
It is written in our bodies,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.496
manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.296
and in families facing cyclical poverty

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.040
and immense cultural rifts
and language barriers.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.400
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.936
Beauty has this ability
to grow anywhere and everywhere

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
at any time.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.200
Beauty is what connects people
through time and place.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.720
Beauty is a liberation from suffering.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.976
As Khmer artists work to revive
our culture and country,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.240
we find that there are many paths
in which to move forward into the future.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.336
And in a tradition where we often
don't know the dancer's names,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.576
who they were,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.096
what their lives were like,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.976
what they felt,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.200
let me propose that we move forward
honestly and openly from "khnhom."

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.576
Khnhom not as in slave,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.520
but as in conscious service.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.216
Khnhom:

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.856
"I,"

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.376
"me,"

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.600
"flowering."

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.776
My name is Prumsodun Ok.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.016
I am Khmer,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.016
and I am American.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.376
I am the child of refugees,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.336
a creator, a healer,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.080
and a builder of bridges.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.256
I am my teacher's first male student

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.576
in a tradition understood
by many as female,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.680
and I founded Cambodia's first
gay dance company.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.976
I am the incarnation
of the beauty, dreams and power

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.936
of those who came before me.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.456
The convergence
of past, present and future,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.920
and of individual and collective.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.296
Let me then play
that ancient and ageless role

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.416
of the artist as messenger,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.680
by sharing the words of Chheng Phon

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.816
"A garden with only one type of flower,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.856
or flowers of only one color,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.080
is no good."

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.520
This is a reminder that our strength,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.416
growth,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.656
survival

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.896
and very existence,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.280
lies in diversity.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.936
It is, however,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.760
a message of courage as well.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.880
For a flower does not ask
for anyone's permission to bloom.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.600
It was born to offer itself to the world.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.320
Fearless love is its nature.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.096
Thank you.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.480
(Applause)
