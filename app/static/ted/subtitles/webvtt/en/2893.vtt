WEBVTT

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.361
The year is 1418.

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:16.322
On the horizon, a shimmering vision
under the blazing sun.

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:19.011
This is not a cloud,

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.081
or anything you've ever seen before.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.776
It's an enormous ship

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:29.632
followed by dozens and dozens more.

00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:34.328
Strange men come towards you
in their white robes

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:39.682
carrying with them knowledge
and treasures from a distant land.

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:44.914
This unimaginable assemblage
was led by Admiral Zheng He

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:47.345
who established the first-ever sea route

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:51.114
connecting the western Pacific
to the Indian Ocean.

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:53.972
The influence of this voyage
was so profound

00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:57.132
that it changed the local cultures
wherever it landed.

00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:00.264
With navigation skills,
shipbuilding techniques,

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:03.868
Chinese etiquette
and social practices on display.

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:07.082
Even today, the impact
of Admiral Zheng's armada

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:11.034
can be traced from Africa
all the way back to Asia.

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:17.316
I'm here to tell you that another invasion
is happening 600 years later

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:19.804
and this one will impact you.

00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:23.525
This one is also led by Chinese,

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.162
but this time, it's Chinese millennials.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:27.794
(Laughter)

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:32.281
I know a ton has been written
and said about American millennials -

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.704
it's all you guys talk about!

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.934
You're trying to study them, label them,

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.135
define them,

00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:42.597
and most importantly,
you're trying to cater to them.

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:43.720
(Laughter)

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.750
I'd like to suggest that you might be
looking at the wrong group of millennials

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.348
on the wrong continent.

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:51.574
Because whether you're ready or not,

00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:54.596
we Chinese millennials
are about to take over the world!

00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:56.017
(Laughter)

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.007
But luckily, I'm here to help you.

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:01.574
(Laughter)

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.924
Here are five things you must know

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:07.445
for surviving the impending
Chinese millennial invasion.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.665
(Laughter)

00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:12.847
Number one: We are many!

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:14.095
(Laughter)

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:17.674
Do you know how many
American millennials you have today?

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.424
90 million.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:22.346
That's a lot.

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:25.606
Now, imagine that times five.

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:28.508
That's how many of us there are.

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:31.310
With a population of around 400 million,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.000
we Chinese millennials are proud to be
the third biggest country in the world.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.817
Most of the talk about American
millennials is related to the workplace.

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:43.970
With almost five times
the amount of American millennials,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.039
Chinese millennials
are an enormous labor pool.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.329
And we're being completely
overlooked in the U.S.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.089
Who would you rather hire?

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.396
A new employee who
is the best out of 100 people?

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:59.431
Or a new employee
who is the best out of 500?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.311
And since there are so many of us,

00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:05.649
you'll be seeing more of us
in places you never thought of.

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.711
Don't believe me?

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.270
This guy seems pretty popular here.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.078
(Laughter)

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.669
He might look old;
he's actually one of us millennials.

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:18.418
20 years ago, who would have imagined

00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:21.032
that a seven foot-plus
tall Chinese athlete

00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:26.111
would become the only non-American player
to lead the NBA in all-star voting.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:31.491
Number two: We're well educated
and super motivated.

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:35.683
Because of the high population density
and limited resources,

00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:38.686
labor is easily replaceable in China.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.674
We are required to work harder
and be more motivated

00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:43.983
just to compete with our peers.

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:47.614
We're surely not
all of the labor pool in China.

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:49.573
I contacted Dx Consulting.

00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:54.206
Today, 57 percent of Chinese millennials
have a bachelor's degree;

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:57.894
23 percent of us have a master's degree;

00:03:57.894 --> 00:04:00.631
and 20 percent have an associate's degree.

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:03.955
And of course, we're
not just educated in China.

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:10.426
In the U.S. in 2014 and '15, 42 percent
of Chinese students were studying STEM -

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.855
science, technology,
engineering, mathematics -

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.858
versus 12 percent for American students.

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.875
27 percent of us were studying
business and management

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:24.477
versus 16 for all students
studying in the U.S.

00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:28.185
We are choosing majors
that can give us a competitive edge,

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:32.524
and in turn, higher exposure
and impact in Western society.

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:36.016
Are you having a hard time motivating
your American millennial employees?

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:38.115
(Laughter)

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:42.725
Well, Chinese millennials don't need you
to spend a dime on a Foosball table

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:44.827
or an in-house coffee shop.

00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:46.955
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:53.847
We are already super
motivated and qualified.

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:55.240
(Laughter)

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.918
And we're more than happy
to take on the tough jobs.

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:00.268
In fact, we've been preparing for it.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:04.865
Number three: We are
the Bruce Lee in Levi's

00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:08.385
with a smartphone
who shop online every day.

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:11.417
Chinese millennials are multicultural.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.936
I even used chopsticks
to eat Georgian barbecue

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:17.036
when I was interning here in Atlanta.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.506
And I was more devastated
at this guy's death

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:22.985
than my best scores on my Chinese exam.

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:25.544
We are really digital.

00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:31.788
In 2017, smartphone penetration rates
is almost 100 percent

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:35.035
for those of us who are ages 18 to 34.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:39.127
We are also shaping mobile payment
as well as the economy.

00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:42.877
According to a 2017 survey from Labbrand,

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:46.874
86 percent of Chinese millennials
use mobile payment in physical shops

00:05:46.874 --> 00:05:51.118
at least once a week, versus
45 percent for American millennials.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:52.988
And according to Dx Consulting,

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:57.558
we spend four times what American
millennials spend for mobile purchases.

00:05:58.686 --> 00:06:01.950
The U.S. is the center
of the digital universe.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.811
But for how much longer?

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:07.342
If you want to buy
the best digital real estate

00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:09.649
in the virtual world of the future,

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:12.770
I suggest that China is a prime location.

00:06:13.328 --> 00:06:15.001
The good news for foreign companies

00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:17.809
hoping to capture part
of the Chinese millennial market

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:21.581
is that my cohort is extremely
mobile and adventurous.

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.460
Here's my personal travel map
for the last couple of years.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.552
The desire to see the world
dominates our consumption habits.

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:32.661
We aren't just spending money at home,

00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:35.607
we are also making purchases
and using web services

00:06:35.607 --> 00:06:38.511
from foreign companies
like Airbnb and Uber

00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.132
when we travel overseas.

00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:44.851
Sure, you buy things from us,
and we buy things from you.

00:06:44.851 --> 00:06:46.490
(Laughter)

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.201
So next time you have a meeting
on how to exploit millennial markets,

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:53.230
keep in mind that Chinese
millennials - not American -

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.223
are the biggest emerging
consumer demographic on the planet.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.860
Number four: We're big picture people.

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.581
Do you know how big China is?

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.813
It's around the same size as the States.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.600
But we all know that
there are four time zones

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.221
across the contiguous United States.

00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:17.731
In China, we've got one.

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:22.162
In China, everything is perceived as one.

00:07:22.732 --> 00:07:24.121
One time zone,

00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:25.560
one official language,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.731
one party,

00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:29.597
despite diverse ethnicities and cultures.

00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:34.212
Our thinking always starts
from the overview to the specific.

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:40.141
The Chinese way of writing an address
is country, city, and street.

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:44.460
And we write the date:
year, month, and day.

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:47.642
And because we are
such big picture people,

00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:50.416
we focus much more
on growth and the future

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:52.243
than Americans in the workplace.

00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:57.412
We tend to look at a company as a whole
and see how we fit into it.

00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:02.045
And number five: We're still
Confucian individualists.

00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:07.225
Granted, we Chinese millennials are acting
more and more individual nowadays,

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:10.412
but ten years of iPhone
and online dating apps

00:08:10.412 --> 00:08:14.797
cannot wipe out thousands of years
of Confucian cultures.

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:18.131
A sense of hierarchy
is still deeply entrenched

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.555
in our understanding
and construction of social relations.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.084
In my mind, a child is supposed
to show respect to his parents

00:08:26.084 --> 00:08:27.913
just like if I'm a subordinate.

00:08:27.913 --> 00:08:31.474
I'm expected to show respect
to a senior manager.

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:35.552
I don't think we should disagree
with our bosses or criticize them,

00:08:35.552 --> 00:08:38.111
at least not directly or publicly.

00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:39.407
(Laughter)

00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:43.132
(Laughter)

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:46.887
My American friends are more likely
to challenge authority and power,

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:48.916
and I think that's a good thing.

00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:52.102
We might learn a little bit
from American millennials on that,

00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:56.035
but I do like our respect
for hierarchy and experience,

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.682
and I don't want to see that go away.

00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:02.444
In 20 years, we'll all
still be millennials,

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:03.981
but we'll be 40,

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:06.423
we'll be in bigger positions of power,

00:09:06.423 --> 00:09:09.562
and we'll have much more opportunity
to change the world

00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:12.564
like we insist we know
how to do right now.

00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:15.155
And I really hope we do.

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:19.375
Everybody knows the Great Wall of China.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:24.413
Even those ancient walls were crossed
by Admiral Zheng He 600 years ago,

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:29.633
and our new border, if we even had one,
is far beyond the old one.

00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:32.513
Whether you're trying
to build your own walls,

00:09:32.513 --> 00:09:35.306
keep out what you don't want,
keep in what you do,

00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:36.545
hold in your pride,

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:38.323
keep out competition,

00:09:38.323 --> 00:09:41.544
all those things
are going to happen anyway.

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:43.844
The world is flat.

00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:45.284
It's flat!

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.854
But it's tilted toward China now.

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:49.294
(Laughter)

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:51.286
And I can assure you,

00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:55.695
we Chinese millennials are ready to be
the explorers in this new adventure

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.515
from the Far East.

00:09:57.515 --> 00:09:58.632
Thank you.

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:01.006
(Applause) (Cheers)
