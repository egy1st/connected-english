00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.086
I want us to start
by thinking about this device,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.164
the phone that's very likely
in your pockets right now.

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.860
Over 40 percent of Americans 
check their phones

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:14.114
within five minutes
of waking up every morning.

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:17.863
And then they look at it
another 50 times during the day.

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:21.724
Grownups consider this device
to be a necessity.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.888
But now I want you to imagine it
in the hands of a three-year-old,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.566
and as a society, we get anxious.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.343
Parents are very worried

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.846
that this device is going to stunt
their children's social growth;

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.535
that it's going to keep them
from getting up and moving;

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.931
that somehow,

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.846
this is going to disrupt childhood.

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.619
So, I want to challenge this attitude.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.475
I can envision a future

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.400
where we would be excited to see
a preschooler interacting with a screen.

00:00:56.527 --> 00:01:01.002
These screens can get kids
up and moving even more.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.244
They have the power to tell us more
about what a child is learning

00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:07.115
than a standardized test can.

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:09.095
And here's the really crazy thought:

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.928
I believe that these screens
have the power

00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:14.661
to prompt more real-life conversations

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:16.943
between kids and their parents.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:21.768
Now, I was perhaps
an unlikely champion for this cause.

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:23.753
I studied children's literature

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:26.311
because I was going to work
with kids and books.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.935
But about 20 years ago,

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.127
I had an experience that shifted my focus.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.738
I was helping lead a research study
about preschoolers and websites.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.521
And I walked in and was assigned
a three-year-old named Maria.

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:44.868
Maria had actually never seen
a computer before.

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:48.038
So the first thing I had to do
was teach her how to use the mouse,

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:53.492
and when I opened up the screen,
she moved it across the screen,

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:56.751
and she stopped on a character
named X the Owl.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.529
And when she did that,

00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:02.345
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.742
Maria dropped the mouse,
pushed back from the table, leaped up

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.550
and started waving
frantically back at him.

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:12.246
Her connection to that character

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.540
was visceral.

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.343
This wasn't a passive screen experience.

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:19.933
This was a human experience.

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:23.286
And it was exactly appropriate
for a three-year-old.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.975
I've now worked at PBS Kids
for more than 15 years,

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.620
and my work there is focused on
harnessing the power of technology

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:36.306
as a positive in children's lives.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.792
I believe that as a society,
we're missing a big opportunity.

00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:42.059
We're letting our fear and our skepticism

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.516
about these devices

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.052
hold us back from realizing
their potential

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:47.501
in our children's lives.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.886
Fear about kids and technology
is nothing new;

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.544
we've been here before.

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:58.285
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging
about the newly dominant media:

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.984
the television.

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.008
That box in the living room?

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:04.678
It might be separating kids
from one another.

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.349
It might keep them away
from the outside world.

00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:11.566
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.673
the long-running host
of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:19.427
challenged society
to look at television as a tool,

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.170
a tool that could promote
emotional growth.

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.377
Here's what he did:

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:27.099
he looked out from the screen,
and he held a conversation,

00:03:27.797 --> 00:03:32.043
as if he were speaking
to each child individually

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.809
about feelings.

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.128
And then he would pause

00:03:36.063 --> 00:03:37.755
and let them think about them.

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:42.939
You can see his influence
across the media landscape today,

00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:45.950
but at the time, this was revolutionary.

00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:51.310
He shifted the way we looked at television
in the lives of children.

00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:55.750
Today it's not just one box.

00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.293
Kids are surrounded by devices.

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:02.886
And I'm also a parent -- I understand
this feeling of anxiety.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.085
But I want us to look
at three common fears

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.622
that parents have,

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:11.490
and see if we can shift our focus

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:14.145
to the opportunity that's in each of them.

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.024
So.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.399
Fear number one:

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.608
"Screens are passive.

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:22.667
This is going to keep our kids
from getting up and moving."

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:27.408
Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt
are zoologist brothers

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:30.364
who host a show about animals
called "Wild Kratts."

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.250
And they approached the PBS team to say,

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.437
"Can we do something with those cameras

00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:37.762
that are built into every device now?

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:42.471
Could those cameras capture
a very natural kid play pattern --

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:44.495
pretending to be animals?"

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.264
So we started with bats.

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.683
And when kids came in to play this game,

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.668
they loved seeing themselves
on-screen with wings.

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:55.889
But my favorite part of this,

00:04:55.913 --> 00:04:59.205
when the game was over
and we turned off the screens?

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.142
The kids kept being bats.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.103
They kept flying around the room,

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:06.192
they kept veering left and right
to catch mosquitoes.

00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:08.473
And they remembered things.

00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:12.023
They remembered that bats fly at night.

00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:14.929
And they remembered that when bats sleep,

00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:17.438
they hang upside down
and fold their wings in.

00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.239
This game definitely got kids
up and moving.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.039
But also, now when kids go outside,

00:05:25.063 --> 00:05:27.260
do they look at a bird and think,

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:30.024
"How does a bird fly
differently than I flew

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:31.255
when I was a bat?"

00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:35.930
The digital technology prompted
embodied learning

00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:38.585
that kids can now take out into the world.

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:42.753
Fear number two:

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.999
"Playing games on these screens
is just a waste of time.

00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:49.825
It's going to distract children
from their education."

00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:53.408
Game developers know

00:05:53.432 --> 00:05:55.842
that you can learn a lot
about a player's skill

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:57.944
by looking at the back-end data:

00:05:57.968 --> 00:06:00.282
Where did a player pause?

00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:03.952
Where did they make a few mistakes
before they found the right answer?

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:08.335
My team wanted to take that tool set
and apply it to academic learning.

00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:12.415
Our producer in Boston, WGBH,

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.162
created a series of Curious George games

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:16.735
focused on math.

00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:23.391
And researchers came in and had
80 preschoolers play these games.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:25.979
They then gave all 80
of those preschoolers

00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:27.946
a standardized math test.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:29.784
We could see early on

00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.936
that these games
were actually helping kids

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.960
understand some key skills.

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:37.813
But our partners at UCLA
wanted us to dig deeper.

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:41.831
They focus on data analysis
and student assessment.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.847
And they wanted to take
that back-end game-play data

00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:50.044
and see if they could use it
to predict a child's math scores.

00:06:50.068 --> 00:06:53.718
So they made a neural net --
they essentially trained the computer

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:55.264
to use this data,

00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:56.788
and here are the results.

00:06:56.812 --> 00:07:00.742
This is a subset of the children's
standardized math scores.

00:07:01.424 --> 00:07:02.594
And this

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.116
is the computer's prediction
of each child's score,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.158
based on playing
some Curious George games.

00:07:11.688 --> 00:07:14.098
The prediction is astonishingly accurate,

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:17.134
especially considering the fact
that these games weren't built

00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.363
for assessment.

00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:21.869
The team that did this study
believes that games like these

00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:25.578
can teach us more
about a child's cognitive learning

00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:27.602
than a standardized test can.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.975
What if games could reduce
testing time in the classroom?

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.672
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.025
How could they give teachers
snapshots of insight

00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:43.155
to help them better focus
their individualized learning?

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:49.052
So the third fear I want to address

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:52.060
is the one that I think
is often the biggest.

00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:53.266
And that's this:

00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:57.749
"These screens are isolating me
from my child."

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.122
Let's play out a scenario.

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.859
Let's say that you are a parent,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.881
and you need 25 minutes
of uninterrupted time

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:08.463
to get dinner ready.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:12.146
And in order to do that,
you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.147
Now, this is a moment
where you probably feel very guilty

00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.570
about what you just did.

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:19.745
But now imagine this:

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:22.819
Twenty minutes later,
you receive a text message.

00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:25.817
on that cell phone
that's always within arm's reach.

00:08:25.841 --> 00:08:30.379
And it says: "Alex just matched
five rhyming words.

00:08:30.403 --> 00:08:32.246
Ask him to play this game with you.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.094
Can you think of a word
that rhymes with 'cat'?

00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:37.534
Or how about 'ball'?"

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:42.524
In our studies, when parents receive
simple tips like these,

00:08:42.548 --> 00:08:44.193
they felt empowered.

00:08:44.217 --> 00:08:45.827
They were so excited

00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:48.475
to play these games
at the dinner table with their kids.

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:50.101
And the kids loved it, too.

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:53.040
Not only did it feel like magic
that their parents knew

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:54.627
what they had been playing,

00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:57.946
kids love to play games
with their parents.

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:03.107
Just the act of talking to kids
about their media

00:09:03.131 --> 00:09:05.131
can be incredibly powerful.

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.154
Last summer, Texas Tech University
published a study

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.540
that the show "Daniel Tiger's
Neighborhood" could promote

00:09:12.564 --> 00:09:15.956
the development of empathy among children.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.779
But there was a really important
catch to this study:

00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:23.260
the greatest benefit was only
when parents talked to kids

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:25.170
about what they watched.

00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:27.194
Neither just watching

00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:29.218
nor just talking about it was enough;

00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:31.500
it was the combination that was key.

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:34.667
So when I read this study,

00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:36.095
I started thinking about

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:41.372
how rarely parents of preschoolers
actually talk to kids about the content

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:43.782
of what they're playing
and what they're watching.

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:46.269
And so I decided to try it
with my four-year-old.

00:09:46.293 --> 00:09:47.451
I said,

00:09:48.077 --> 00:09:50.906
"Were you playing a car game
earlier today?"

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:53.334
And Benjamin perked up and said,

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:57.203
"Yes! And did you see
that I made my car out of a pickle?

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.314
It was really hard to open the trunk."

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:00.996
(Laughter)

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.105
This hilarious conversation
about what was fun in the game

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:06.640
and what could have been better

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:09.444
continued all the way
to school that morning.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.915
I'm not here to suggest to you
that all digital media is great for kids.

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:20.625
There are legitimate reasons
for us to be concerned

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:23.108
about the current state
of children's content

00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:24.376
on these screens.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:27.837
And it's right for us
to be thinking about balance:

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:31.521
Where do screens fit
against all the other things

00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:34.639
that a child needs to do
to learn and to grow?

00:10:36.258 --> 00:10:39.065
But when we fixate on our fears about it,

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:41.873
we forget a really major point,

00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:46.095
and that is, that kids are living
in the same world that we live in,

00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:48.804
the world where the grownups
check their phones

00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:50.719
more than 50 times a day.

00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:54.692
Screens are a part of children's lives.

00:10:56.048 --> 00:10:59.048
And if we pretend that they aren't,

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:02.067
or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,

00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:06.500
kids are never going to learn
how and why to use them.

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:11.170
What if we start raising our expectations

00:11:11.194 --> 00:11:12.546
for this media?

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:15.398
What if we start talking to kids regularly

00:11:15.422 --> 00:11:17.543
about the content on these screens?

00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:21.055
What if we start looking
for the positive impacts

00:11:21.674 --> 00:11:24.873
that this technology can have
in our children's lives?

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:30.567
That's when the potential of these tools
can become a reality.

00:11:31.344 --> 00:11:32.539
Thank you.

00:11:32.563 --> 00:11:36.063
(Applause)
