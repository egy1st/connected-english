00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:03.026
So there's a lot of valid
concern these days

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.255
that our technology is getting so smart

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.027
that we've put ourselves
on the path to a jobless future.

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.834
And I think the example
of a self-driving car

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:13.532
is actually the easiest one to see.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.884
So these are going to be fantastic
for all kinds of different reasons.

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:20.346
But did you know that "driver"
is actually the most common job

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.159
in 29 of the 50 US states?

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.520
What's going to happen to these jobs
when we're no longer driving our cars

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:27.709
or cooking our food

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.692
or even diagnosing our own diseases?

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.052
Well, a recent study
from Forrester Research

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.239
goes so far to predict
that 25 million jobs

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.425
might disappear over the next 10 years.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:40.882
To put that in perspective,

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:45.052
that's three times as many jobs lost
in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:49.078
And it's not just blue-collar jobs
that are at risk.

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:53.155
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,
we are seeing tremendous gains

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.361
in the quality of analysis
and decision-making

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.039
because of machine learning.

00:00:57.063 --> 00:01:00.587
So even the smartest, highest-paid people
will be affected by this change.

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.384
What's clear is that no matter
what your job is,

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:06.380
at least some, if not all of your work,

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:09.796
is going to be done by a robot
or software in the next few years.

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:13.989
And that's exactly why people
like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:17.401
are talking about the need for
government-funded minimum income levels.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.767
But if our politicians can't agree
on things like health care

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.070
or even school lunches,

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.524
I just don't see a path
where they'll find consensus

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.874
on something as big and as expensive
as universal basic life income.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.261
Instead, I think the response
needs to be led by us in industry.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.809
We have to recognize
the change that's ahead of us

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.808
and start to design the new kinds of jobs

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:39.527
that will still be relevant
in the age of robotics.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.652
The good news is that we have
faced down and recovered

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.862
two mass extinctions of jobs before.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.733
From 1870 to 1970,

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:53.165
the percent of American workers
based on farms fell by 90 percent,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.734
and then again from 1950 to 2010,

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:57.901
the percent of Americans
working in factories

00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.601
fell by 75 percent.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.524
The challenge we face this time,
however, is one of time.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:06.562
We had a hundred years
to move from farms to factories,

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:09.161
and then 60 years to fully build out
a service economy.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:11.003
The rate of change today

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.001
suggests that we may only have
10 or 15 years to adjust,

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.728
and if we don't react fast enough,

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.508
that means by the time
today's elementary-school students

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:20.417
are college-aged,

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:22.582
we could be living
in a world that's robotic,

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:26.289
largely unemployed and stuck
in kind of un-great depression.

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:29.736
But I don't think it has to be this way.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.460
You see, I work in innovation,

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.638
and part of my job is to shape how
large companies apply new technologies.

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:38.060
Certainly some of these technologies

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:40.988
are even specifically designed
to replace human workers.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:44.541
But I believe that if we start
taking steps right now

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.386
to change the nature of work,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.296
we can not only create environments
where people love coming to work

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.438
but also generate
the innovation that we need

00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:55.635
to replace the millions of jobs
that will be lost to technology.

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:00.331
I believe that the key
to preventing our jobless future

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:02.701
is to rediscover what makes us human,

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.683
and to create a new generation
of human-centered jobs

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:08.313
that allow us to unlock
the hidden talents and passions

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.990
that we carry with us every day.

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:14.294
But first, I think
it's important to recognize

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:16.470
that we brought this problem on ourselves.

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.951
And it's not just because, you know,
we are the one building the robots.

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:23.691
But even though most jobs
left the factory decades ago,

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:25.652
we still hold on to this factory mindset

00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:27.635
of standardization and de-skilling.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.876
We still define jobs
around procedural tasks

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.388
and then pay people for the number
of hours that they perform these tasks.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.168
We've created narrow job definitions

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:39.432
like cashier, loan processor
or taxi driver

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.939
and then asked people
to form entire careers

00:03:41.963 --> 00:03:43.593
around these singular tasks.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.784
These choices have left us with
actually two dangerous side effects.

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:50.558
The first is that these
narrowly defined jobs

00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:53.005
will be the first
to be displaced by robots,

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.014
because single-task robots
are just the easiest kinds to build.

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.174
But second, we have accidentally made it

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:01.326
so that millions of workers
around the world

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.660
have unbelievably boring working lives.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:05.928
(Laughter)

00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:08.829
Let's take the example
of a call center agent.

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.856
Over the last few decades,
we brag about lower operating costs

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.307
because we've taken most
of the need for brainpower

00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.475
out of the person
and put it into the system.

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.020
For most of their day,
they click on screens,

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:20.245
they read scripts.

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:24.140
They act more like machines than humans.

00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:27.394
And unfortunately,
over the next few years,

00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:29.277
as our technology gets more advanced,

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.885
they, along with people
like clerks and bookkeepers,

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.321
will see the vast majority
of their work disappear.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.199
To counteract this,
we have to start creating new jobs

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:40.762
that are less centered
on the tasks that a person does

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:43.652
and more focused on the skills
that a person brings to work.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.776
For example, robots are great
at repetitive and constrained work,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.749
but human beings have an amazing ability

00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:52.052
to bring together
capability with creativity

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:54.776
when faced with problems
that we've never seen before.

00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:58.102
It's when every day
brings a little bit of a surprise

00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.130
that we have designed work for humans

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.423
and not for robots.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.028
Our entrepreneurs and engineers
already live in this world,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.644
but so do our nurses and our plumbers

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:09.131
and our therapists.

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.806
You know, it's the nature
of too many companies and organizations

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.520
to just ask people to come to work
and do your job.

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:18.730
But if you work is better done by a robot,

00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:21.551
or your decisions better made by an AI,

00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:23.287
what are you supposed to be doing?

00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:26.497
Well, I think for the manager,

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.918
we need to realistically think about
the tasks that will be disappearing

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.093
over the next few years

00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:34.989
and start planning for more meaningful,
more valuable work that should replace it.

00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:36.442
We need to create environments

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.705
where both human beings and robots thrive.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.265
I say, let's give more work to the robots,

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.192
and let's start with the work
that we absolutely hate doing.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.592
Here, robot,

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.467
process this painfully idiotic report.

00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.914
(Laughter)

00:05:49.938 --> 00:05:51.363
And move this box. Thank you.

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:53.086
(Laughter)

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.639
And for the human beings,

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:58.217
we should follow the advice from Harry
Davis at the University of Chicago.

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.890
He says we have to make it so that people
don't leave too much of themselves

00:06:01.914 --> 00:06:03.245
in the trunk of their car.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.158
I mean, human beings
are amazing on weekends.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:09.326
Think about the people that you know
and what they do on Saturdays.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.326
They're artists, carpenters,
chefs and athletes.

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:16.982
But on Monday, they're back
to being Junior HR Specialist

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:19.105
and Systems Analyst 3.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.910
(Laughter)

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.252
You know, these narrow job titles
not only sound boring,

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:28.372
but they're actually
a subtle encouragement

00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:31.436
for people to make narrow
and boring job contributions.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.576
But I've seen firsthand
that when you invite people to be more,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.990
they can amaze us
with how much more they can be.

00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:40.560
A few years ago,
I was working at a large bank

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:43.680
that was trying to bring more innovation
into its company culture.

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:46.045
So my team and I designed
a prototyping contest

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.039
that invited anyone to build
anything that they wanted.

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:51.537
We were actually trying to figure out

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.829
whether or not
the primary limiter to innovation

00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:56.343
was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.228
and it turns out it was neither one.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.007
It was an empowerment problem.

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:02.940
And the results
of the program were amazing.

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:06.755
We started by inviting
people to reenvision

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:08.894
what it is they could bring to a team.

00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:12.656
This contest was not only a chance
to build anything that you wanted

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.016
but also be anything that you wanted.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.326
And when people were no longer
limited by their day-to-day job titles,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.497
they felt free to bring all kinds
of different skills and talents

00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.007
to the problems
that they were trying to solve.

00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:27.941
We saw technology people being designers,
marketing people being architects,

00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:31.330
and even finance people showing off
their ability to write jokes.

00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:32.757
(Laughter)

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:34.186
We ran this program twice,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.006
and each time more than 400 people
brought their unexpected talents to work

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.169
and solved problems that they had been
wanting to solve for years.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.509
Collectively, they created
millions of dollars of value,

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:49.098
building things like a better
touch-tone system for call centers,

00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:50.790
easier desktop tools for branches

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:52.339
and even a thank you card system

00:07:52.363 --> 00:07:55.677
that has become a cornerstone
of the employee working experience.

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.504
Over the course of the eight weeks,

00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:01.061
people flexed muscles that they never
dreamed of using at work.

00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:03.930
People learned new skills,

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:06.322
they met new people,

00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:09.139
and at the end, somebody
pulled me aside and said,

00:08:09.163 --> 00:08:10.732
"I have to tell you,

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.532
the last few weeks has been
one of the most intense,

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:16.835
hardest working experiences
of my entire life,

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:18.900
but not one second of it felt like work."

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.378
And that's the key.

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:25.112
For those few weeks, people
got to be creators and innovators.

00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:28.478
They had been dreaming of solutions

00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:30.986
to problems that had been
bugging them for years,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.864
and this was a chance to turn
those dreams into a reality.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.111
And that dreaming is an important part
of what separates us from machines.

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:42.153
For now, our machines
do not get frustrated,

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:43.584
they do not get annoyed,

00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:45.868
and they certainly don't imagine.

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.591
But we, as human beings --

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:48.822
we feel pain,

00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:50.246
we get frustrated.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.386
And it's when we're most annoyed
and most curious

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.673
that we're motivated to dig
into a problem and create change.

00:08:57.546 --> 00:09:01.456
Our imaginations are the birthplace
of new products, new services,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.713
and even new industries.

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:05.278
I believe that the jobs of the future

00:09:05.302 --> 00:09:07.015
will come from the minds of people

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:09.755
who today we call
analysts and specialists,

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:13.257
but only if we give them the freedom
and protection that they need to grow

00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.750
into becoming explorers and inventors.

00:09:16.714 --> 00:09:18.857
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,

00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:21.116
we, as leaders, need
to get out of the mindset

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.970
of telling people what to do

00:09:22.994 --> 00:09:26.815
and instead start asking them
what problems they're inspired to solve

00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:29.204
and what talents
they want to bring to work.

00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:33.124
Because when you can bring
your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,

00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:35.142
you'll look forward to Mondays more,

00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:37.848
and those feelings
that we have about Mondays

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:39.630
are part of what makes us human.

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:43.475
And as we redesign work
for an era of intelligent machines,

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.715
I invite you all to work alongside me

00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:48.381
to bring more humanity
to our working lives.

00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:49.556
Thank you.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.981
(Applause)
