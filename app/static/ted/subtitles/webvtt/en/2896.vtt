00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:05.110
I recently read about
what the young generation of workers want

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:06.985
in Harvard Business Review.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.021
One thing that stuck out to me
was: don't just talk about impact,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.706
but make an impact.

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:16.727
I'm a little bit older than you,

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:19.408
maybe much older than you,

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:23.965
but this is exactly the same goal
that I had when I was in college.

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:30.174
I wanted to make my own impact
for those who live under injustice;

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:33.579
it's the reason that I became
a documentary journalist,

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:35.166
the reason I became

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.141
a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.857
It was March 17, 2009.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.422
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.000
but it was the day
that turned my life upside down.

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:56.127
My team and I were making a documentary
about North Korean refugees

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:59.621
living below human life in China.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.262
We were at the border.

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.144
It was our last day of filming.

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:10.224
There was no wire fence

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:11.518
or bars

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.838
or sign to show that it is the border,

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:17.613
but this is a place that a lot
of North Korean defectors use

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.099
as an escape route.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.669
It was still winter,

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:25.186
and the river was frozen.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.361
When we were in the middle
of the frozen river,

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.297
we were filming about
the condition of the cold weather

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.519
and the environment

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.269
that North Koreans had to deal with

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.120
when they seek their freedom.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.294
And suddenly, one
of my team members shouted,

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:43.471
"Soldiers!"

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.634
So I looked back,

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:51.306
and there were two small soldiers
in green uniforms with rifles,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.722
chasing after us.

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:55.926
We all ran as fast as we could.

00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:59.762
I prayed that, please
don't let them shoot my head.

00:02:00.422 --> 00:02:02.224
And I was thinking that,

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:04.982
if my feet are on Chinese soil,

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.359
I'll be safe.

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:08.576
And I made it to Chinese soil.

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:13.702
Then I saw my colleague
Laura Ling fall on her knees.

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.047
I didn't know what to do
at that short moment,

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.698
but I knew that I could not
leave her alone there

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.713
when she said,
"Euna, I can't feel my legs."

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.663
In a flash, we were surrounded
by these two Korean soldiers.

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:31.030
They were not much bigger than us,

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:34.753
but they were determined
to take us to their army base.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.980
I begged and yelled for any kind of help,

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.156
hoping that someone
would show up from China.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:45.298
Here I was, being stubborn

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:48.476
towards a trained soldier with a gun.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.157
I looked at his eyes.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.066
He was just a boy.

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:58.549
At that moment,
he raised his rifle to hit me,

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.715
but I saw that he was hesitating.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.514
His eyes were shaking,

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:05.676
and his rifle was still up in the air.

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.479
So I shouted at him,

00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:10.809
"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:12.731
And I got up.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.083
When we arrived at their army base,

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:21.891
my head was spinning
with these worst-case scenarios,

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:24.880
and my colleague's
statement wasn't helping.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.026
She said, "We are the enemy."

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.637
She was right: we were the enemy.

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.975
And I was supposed to be frightened, too.

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.710
But I kept having these odd experiences.

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:41.677
This time, an officer brought me his coat

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.112
to keep me warm,

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:47.127
because I lost my coat on the frozen river

00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:49.358
while battling with one of these soldiers.

00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:54.779
I will tell you what I mean
by these odd experiences.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:57.096
I grew up in South Korea.

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.519
To us, North Korea was always the enemy,

00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:02.981
even before I was born.

00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:09.017
South and North have been
under armistice for 63 years,

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.158
since the end of the Korean War.

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.678
And growing up in the South
in the '80s and '90s,

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:19.179
we were taught propaganda
about North Korea.

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:23.829
And we heard so many graphic stories,

00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:27.568
such as, a little young boy
being brutally killed

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:31.068
by North Korean spies
just because he said,

00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:32.465
"I don't like communists."

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:37.453
Or, I watched this cartoon series

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:42.232
about a young South Korean boy
defeating these fat, big, red pig,

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:46.221
which represented the North Koreans'
first leader at the time.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.999
And the effect of hearing
these horrible stories over and over

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.411
instilled one word in a young mind:

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:57.628
"enemy."

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.553
And I think at some point,
I dehumanized them,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.399
and the people of North Korea
became equated

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.835
with the North Korean government.

00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.944
Now, back to my detention.

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:16.121
It was the second day

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:17.521
of being in a cell.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:21.435
I had not slept
since I was out at the border.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.710
This young guard came to my cell

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:29.250
and offered me this small boiled egg

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:32.829
and said, "This will give you
strength to keep going."

00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:36.407
Do you know what it is like,

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:40.898
receiving a small kindness
in the enemy's hand?

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:45.059
Whenever they were kind to me,
I thought the worst case

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.170
was waiting for me after the kindness.

00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:52.111
One officer noticed my nervousness.

00:05:52.717 --> 00:05:56.570
He said, "Did you think
we were all these red pigs?"

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.796
referring to the cartoon
that I just showed you.

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:06.637
Every day was like a psychological battle.

00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:09.752
The interrogator had me sit at a table

00:06:09.776 --> 00:06:11.276
six days a week

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.390
and had me writing down
about my journey, my work,

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:20.129
over and over until I wrote down
the confession that they wanted to hear.

00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:24.455
After about three months of detention,

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.341
the North Korean court sentenced me

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:31.849
to 12 years in a labor camp.

00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:35.635
So I was just sitting in my room
to be transferred.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.784
At that time, I really had
nothing else to do,

00:06:38.808 --> 00:06:41.692
so I paid attention
to these two female guards

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:44.062
and listened to what
they were talking about.

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.992
Guard A was older,

00:06:47.016 --> 00:06:49.473
and she studied English.

00:06:49.497 --> 00:06:53.464
She seemed like she came
from an affluent family.

00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:55.916
She often showed up
with these colorful dresses,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.483
and then loved to show off.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.561
And Guard B was the younger one,

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:03.395
and she was a really good singer.

00:07:04.263 --> 00:07:09.171
She loved to sing Celine Dion's
"My Heart Will Go On" --

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.661
sometimes too much.

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:14.517
She knew just how
to torture me without knowing.

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.185
(Laughter)

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:22.878
And this girl spent a lot of time
in the morning to put on makeup,

00:07:22.902 --> 00:07:26.237
like you can see in any young girl's life.

00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:31.341
And they loved to watch
this Chinese drama,

00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:33.151
a better quality production.

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:36.202
I remember Guard B said,

00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:40.949
"I can no longer watch our TV shows
after watching this."

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:43.855
She got scolded

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:48.075
for degrading her own country's
produced TV shows.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:52.100
Guard B had more
of a free mind than Guard A,

00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:57.736
and she often got scolded by Guard A
whenever she expressed herself.

00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:01.713
One day, they invited
all these female colleagues --

00:08:01.737 --> 00:08:03.638
I don't know where they came from --

00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:06.204
to where I was held,

00:08:06.228 --> 00:08:07.796
and they invited me

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.594
to their guard room

00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:11.203
and asked

00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:14.806
if one-night stands
really happen in the US.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.016
(Laughter)

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.095
This is the country where
young couples are not even allowed

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:24.799
to hold hands in public.

00:08:24.823 --> 00:08:27.751
I had no idea where they
had gotten this information,

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:31.352
but they were shy and giggly
even before I said anything.

00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:35.987
I think we all forgot
that I was their prisoner,

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:40.285
and it was like going back
to my high school classroom again.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.040
And I learned that these girls also
grew up watching a similar cartoon,

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:52.100
but just propaganda towards
South Korea and the US.

00:08:52.124 --> 00:08:57.583
I started to understand where
these people's anger was coming from.

00:08:57.607 --> 00:09:01.398
If these girls grew up
learning that we are enemies,

00:09:01.422 --> 00:09:04.643
it was just natural
that they would hate us

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.496
just as I feared them.

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:11.885
But at that moment, we were all just girls

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.702
who shared the same interests,

00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.341
beyond our ideologies that separated us.

00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:24.476
I shared these stories with my boss
at Current TV at the time

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.910
after I came home.

00:09:25.934 --> 00:09:28.412
His first reaction was,

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:31.328
"Euna, have you heard
of Stockholm Syndrome?"

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:36.311
Yes, and I clearly remember

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.813
the feeling of fear

00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.344
and being threatened,

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:45.542
and tension rising up
between me and the interrogator

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:47.535
when we talked about politics.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:51.571
There definitely was a wall
that we couldn't climb over.

00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:56.396
But we were able to see
each other as human beings

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.821
when we talked about family,

00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:00.422
everyday life,

00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:03.357
the importance of the future
for our children.

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:09.466
It was about a month before I came home.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.822
I got really sick.

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:15.723
Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,

00:10:15.747 --> 00:10:18.576
because she was leaving
the detention center.

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:23.995
She made sure that no one watched us,

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.603
no one heard us,

00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:27.182
and quietly said,

00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:29.036
"I hope you get better

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.961
and go back to your family soon."

00:10:33.312 --> 00:10:34.943
It is these people --

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.484
the officer who brought me his coat,

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:43.024
the guard who offered me a boiled egg,

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:47.778
these female guards who asked me
about dating life in the US --

00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:52.375
they are the ones
that I remember of North Korea:

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.822
humans just like us.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:01.189
North Koreans and I were not
ambassadors of our countries,

00:11:01.213 --> 00:11:04.798
but I believe that we were representing

00:11:04.822 --> 00:11:06.327
the human race.

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:10.986
Now I'm back home and back to my life.

00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:16.913
The memory of these people
has blurred as time has passed.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.236
And I'm in this place

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.557
where I read and hear
about North Korea provoking the US.

00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:26.447
I realized how easy it is

00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:29.185
to see them as an enemy again.

00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:36.290
But I have to keep reminding myself
that when I was over there,

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.569
I was able to see humanity

00:11:40.593 --> 00:11:41.745
over hatred

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.360
in my enemy's eyes.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:46.176
Thank you.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.334
(Applause)
