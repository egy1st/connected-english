00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.656
Since 2009, the world has been stuck

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.816
on a single narrative
around a coming global food crisis

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.280
and what we need to do to avoid it.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400
How do we feed
nine billion people by 2050?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.056
Every conference, podcast
and dialogue around global food security

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.776
starts with this question

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.536
and goes on to answer it

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.000
by saying we need to produce
70 percent more food.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.976
The 2050 narrative started to evolve

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.880
shortly after global food prices
hit all-time highs in 2008.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.216
People were suffering and struggling,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.776
governments and world leaders

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.416
needed to show us
that they were paying attention

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.040
and were working to solve it.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.536
The thing is, 2050
is so far into the future

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.560
that we can't even relate to it,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.016
and more importantly,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.296
if we keep doing what we're doing,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.680
it's going to hit us
a lot sooner than that.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.360
I believe we need to ask
a different question.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.616
The answer to that question

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.200
needs to be framed differently.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.856
If we can reframe the old narrative

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.336
and replace it with new numbers

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.440
that tell us a more complete pictures,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.896
numbers that everyone can understand

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.120
and relate to,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.000
we can avoid the crisis altogether.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.416
I was a commodities trader in my past life

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.616
and one of the things
that I learned trading

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520
is that every market has a tipping point,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.936
the point at which
change occurs so rapidly

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.816
that it impacts the world

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.800
and things change forever.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680
Think of the last financial crisis,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480
or the dot-com crash.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.240
So here's my concern.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.816
We could have a tipping point

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.976
in global food and agriculture

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.895
if surging demand

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:17.320
surpasses the agricultural system's
structural capacity to produce food.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.976
This means at this point supply
can no longer keep up with demand

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.256
despite exploding prices,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360
unless we can commit
to some type of structural change.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.336
This time around,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.936
it won't be about stock markets and money.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.336
It's about people.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.760
People could starve
and governments may fall.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.736
This question of at what point
does supply struggle

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.416
to keep up with surging demand

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.096
is one that started off as an interest
for me while I was trading

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.896
and became an absolute obsession.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.856
It went from interest to obsession

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.536
when I realized through my research
how broken the system was

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.880
and how very little data was being used
to make such critical decisions.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.896
That's the point I decided to walk away
from a career on Wall Street

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.416
and start an entrepreneurial journey

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.400
to start Gro Intelligence.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.376
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.656
and doing the work to make it actionable,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.680
to empower decision-makers at every level.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.496
But doing this work,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.776
we also realized that the world,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.456
not just world leaders,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.736
but businesses and citizens
like every single person in this room,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.840
lacked an actionable guide

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.376
on how we can avoid
a coming global food security crisis.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.416
And so we built a model,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.336
leveraging the petabytes
of data we sit on,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.760
and we solved for the tipping point.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.176
Now, no one knows
we've been working on this problem

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
and this is the first time
that I'm sharing what we discovered.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.840
We discovered that the tipping point
is actually a decade from now.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.616
We discovered that the world

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.000
will be short 214 trillion calories

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.399
by 2027.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.240
The world is not in a position
to fill this gap.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.000
Now, you'll notice

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.256
that the way I'm framing this
is different from how I started,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.416
and that's intentional, because until now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.656
this problem has been
quantified using mass:

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.496
think kilograms, tons, hectograms,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.600
whatever your unit of choice is in mass.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.880
Why do we talk about food
in terms of weight?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.776
Because it's easy.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.296
We can look at a photograph
and determine tonnage on a ship

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.576
by using a simple pocket calculator.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.360
We can weigh trucks,
airplanes and oxcarts.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.920
But what we care about
in food is nutritional value.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.176
Not all foods are created equal,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.960
even if they weigh the same.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.376
This I learned firsthand

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
when I moved from Ethiopia
to the US for university.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.336
Upon my return back home,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.576
my father, who was so excited to see me,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.200
greeted me by asking why I was fat.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.736
Now, turns out that eating

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.616
approximately the same amount of food
as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.880
had actually lent
a certain fullness to my figure.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.856
This is why we should care about calories,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.536
not about mass.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.320
It is calories which sustain us.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.696
So 214 trillion calories
is a very large number,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.856
and not even the most dedicated of us

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.816
think in the hundreds
of trillions of calories.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.960
So let me break this down differently.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.216
An alternative way to think about this

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.096
is to think about it in Big Macs.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.736
214 trillion calories.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.976
A single Big Mac has 563 calories.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.216
That means the world will be short
379 billion Big Macs in 2027.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.240
That is more Big Macs
than McDonald's has ever produced.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.016
So how did we get
to these numbers in the first place?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
They're not made up.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.216
This map shows you
where the world was 40 years ago.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.256
It shows you net calorie gaps
in every country in the world.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.736
Now, simply put,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.776
this is just calories
consumed in that country

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.856
minus calories produced
in that same country.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.656
This is not a statement
on malnutrition or anything else.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.696
It's simply saying how many calories
are consumed in a single year

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.576
minus how many are produced.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.976
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.376
or self-sufficient.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.440
They have some in storage for a rainy day.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.896
Red countries are net calorie importers.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.856
The deeper, the brighter the red,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.120
the more you're importing.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.656
40 years ago, such few countries
were net exporters of calories,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.252
I could count them with one hand.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.456
Most of the African continent,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.096
Europe, most of Asia,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.136
South America excluding Argentina,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.880
were all net importers of calories.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.180
And what's surprising is that China
used to actually be food self-sufficient.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.640
India was a big net importer of calories.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.440
40 years later, this is today.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.440
You can see the drastic transformation
that's occurred in the world.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.536
Brazil has emerged
as an agricultural powerhouse.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.816
Europe is dominant in global agriculture.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.816
India has actually flipped
from red to blue.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.096
It's become food self-sufficient.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.576
And China went from that light blue

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.240
to the brightest red
that you see on this map.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.640
How did we get here? What happened?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.800
So this chart shows you India and Africa.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.760
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.576
How is it that two regions
that started off so similarly

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.736
in such similar trajectories

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.896
take such different paths?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.960
India had a green revolution.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.096
Not a single African country
had a green revolution.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.336
The net outcome?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.056
India is food self-sufficient

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.456
and in the past decade
has actually been exporting calories.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.440
The African continent now imports
over 300 trillion calories a year.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.576
Then we add China, the green line.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.280
Remember the switch
from the blue to the bright red?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.176
What happened and when did it happen?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.056
China seemed to be
on a very similar path to India

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.856
until the start of the 21st century,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.560
where it suddenly flipped.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.416
A young and growing population

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.536
combined with significant economic growth

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.976
made its mark with a big bang

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.480
and no one in the markets saw it coming.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.256
This flip was everything
to global agricultural markets.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.096
Luckily now, South America

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.336
was starting to boom
at the same time as China's rise,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.360
and so therefore, supply and demand
were still somewhat balanced.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.720
So the question becomes,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.240
where do we go from here?

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.336
Oddly enough,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.560
it's not a new story,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.176
except this time
it's not just a story of China.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.576
It's a continuation of China,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.696
an amplification of Africa

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.680
and a paradigm shift in India.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.120
By 2023,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.056
Africa's population is forecasted
to overtake that of India's and China's.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.736
By 2023, these three regions combined

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.920
will make up over half
the world's population.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.416
This crossover point starts to present
really interesting challenges

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.176
for global food security.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.600
And a few years later,
we're hit hard with that reality.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.480
What does the world look like in 10 years?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.016
So far, as I mentioned,
India has been food self-sufficient.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.440
Most forecasters predict
that this will continue.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.400
We disagree.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.296
India will soon become
a net importer of calories.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.576
This will be driven both by the fact

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.096
that demand is growing
from a population growth standpoint

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.376
plus economic growth.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.656
It will be driven by both.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.376
And even if you have
optimistic assumptions

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.296
around production growth,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.440
it will make that slight flip.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.880
That slight flip
can have huge implications.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.336
Next, Africa will continue
to be a net importer of calories,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360
again driven by population growth
and economic growth.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.016
This is again assuming optimistic
production growth assumptions.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.456
Then China,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.056
where population is flattening out,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.056
calorie consumption will explode

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.096
because the types of calories consumed

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.640
are also starting to be
higher-calorie-content foods.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.336
And so therefore,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.216
these three regions combined

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.536
start to present a really interesting
challenge for the world.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.656
Until now, countries with calorie deficits

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.256
have been able to meet these deficits

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.120
by importing from surplus regions.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.536
By surplus regions, I'm talking about

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.696
North America, South America and Europe.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.136
This line chart over here shows you

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.456
the growth and the projected growth
over the next decade of production

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.776
from North America,
South America and Europe.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.216
What it doesn't show you

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.680
is that most of this growth is actually
going to come from South America.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.056
And most of this growth

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.480
is going to come
at the huge cost of deforestation.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.016
And so when you look
at the combined demand increase

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.360
coming from India, China
and the African continent,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.016
and look at it versus
the combined increase in production

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.816
coming from India,
China, the African continent,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.200
North America, South America and Europe,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.696
you are left with
a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.456
one we can't produce.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.416
And this, by the way, is actually assuming
we take all the extra calories

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.821
produced in North America,
South America and Europe

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.120
and export them solely
to India, China and Africa.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.680
What I just presented to you
is a vision of an impossible world.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.360
We can do something to change that.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.696
We can change consumption patterns,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.976
we can reduce food waste,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.216
or we can make a bold commitment

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.560
to increasing yields exponentially.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.856
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.376
changing consumption patterns
or reducing food waste,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.456
because those conversations
have been going on for some time now.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.696
Nothing has happened.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.176
Nothing has happened
because those arguments

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.136
ask the surplus regions
to change their behavior

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.600
on behalf of deficit regions.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.456
Waiting for others
to change their behavior

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.976
on your behalf, for your survival,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.496
is a terrible idea.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.120
It's unproductive.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.280
So I'd like to suggest an alternative
that comes from the red regions.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.336
China, India, Africa.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.656
China is constrained in terms
of how much more land it actually has

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.216
available for agriculture,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.016
and it has massive
water resource availability issues.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.680
So the answer really lies
in India and in Africa.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.776
India has some upside
in terms of potential yield increases.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.376
Now this is the gap
between its current yield

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.520
and the theoretical
maximum yield it can achieve.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.936
It has some unfarmed
arable land remaining, but not much,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.240
India is quite land-constrained.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.896
Now, the African continent,
on the other hand,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.216
has vast amounts of arable land remaining

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.920
and significant
upside potential in yields.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.176
Somewhat simplified picture here,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.216
but if you look at sub-Saharan
African yields in corn today,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.720
they are where North American
yields were in 1940.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.336
We don't have 70-plus years
to figure this out,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.896
so it means we need to try something new

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.080
and we need to try something different.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.560
The solution starts with reforms.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.856
We need to reform and commercialize

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.416
the agricultural industries in Africa

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.640
and in India.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.456
Now, by commercialization --

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.616
commercialization is not
about commercial farming alone.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.216
Commercialization is about leveraging data

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.536
to craft better policies,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.176
to improve infrastructure,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.056
to lower the transportation costs

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.336
and to completely reform
banking and insurance industries.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.456
Commercialization
is about taking agriculture

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.576
from too risky an endeavor
to one where fortunes can be made.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.856
Commercialization
is not about just farmers.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.160
Commercialization is about
the entire agricultural system.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.896
But commercialization
also means confronting the fact

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.336
that we can no longer place
the burden of growth

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.480
on small-scale farmers alone,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.856
and accepting that commercial farms
and the introduction of commercial farms

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.576
could provide certain economies of scale

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.840
that even small-scale
farmers can leverage.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.016
It is not about small-scale farming
or commercial agriculture,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.896
or big agriculture.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.176
We can create the first successful models
of the coexistence and success

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.976
of small-scale farming
alongside commercial agriculture.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.016
This is because, for the first time ever,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.776
the most critical tool
for success in the industry --

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.296
data and knowledge --

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.560
is becoming cheaper by the day.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.136
And very soon, it won't matter
how much money you have

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.616
or how big you are

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.936
to make optimal decisions
and maximize probability of success

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.440
in reaching your intended goal.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.920
Companies like Gro are working
really hard to make this a reality.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.176
So if we can commit
to this new, bold initiative,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.216
to this new, bold change,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.656
not only can we solve
the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.280
but we can actually set the world
on a whole new path.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.056
India can remain food self-sufficient

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.840
and Africa can emerge
as the world's next dark blue region.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.456
The new question is,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.616
how do we produce 214 trillion calories

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.800
to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.240
We have the solution.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.760
We just need to act on it.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.736
Thank you.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.119
(Applause)
