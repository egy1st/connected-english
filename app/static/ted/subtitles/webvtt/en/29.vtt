WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.932
You'll be happy to know that
I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:06.257
but other people's tragedy.

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:09.350
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted
about other people's tragedy

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:10.525
than your own,

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.276
and I want to keep it
in the spirit of the conference.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.238
So, if you believe the media accounts,

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:21.815
being a drug dealer in the height
of the crack cocaine epidemic

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.665
was a very glamorous life,
in the words of Virginia Postrel.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.868
There was money,
there was drugs, guns, women,

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:33.380
you know, you name it -- jewelry,
bling-bling -- it had it all.

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:39.645
What I'm going to tell you today is that,
in fact, based on 10 years of research,

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:42.128
a unique opportunity
to go inside a gang --

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:45.060
to see the actual books,
the financial records of the gang --

00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:47.452
that the answer turns out not to be

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:50.976
that being in the gang
was a glamorous life.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.751
But I think, more realistically,
that being in a gang --

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:57.681
selling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps
the worst job in all of America.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.570
And that's what I'd like
to convince you of today.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.505
So there are three things I want to do.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.237
First, I want to explain
how and why crack cocaine

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:10.318
had such a profound influence
on inner-city gangs.

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:13.601
Secondly, I want to tell you

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:18.501
how somebody like me
came to be able to see

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:21.882
the inner workings of a gang --
an interesting story, I think.

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:24.816
And then third, I want to tell you,
in a very superficial way,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.427
about some of the things we found

00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:29.015
when we actually got to look
at the financial records,

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.727
the books, of the gang.

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.180
So before I do that, just one warning,

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:37.938
which is that this presentation
has been rated 'R'

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:40.236
by the Motion Picture
Association of America.

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.331
It contains adult themes, adult language.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.410
Given who is up on the stage,
you'll be delighted to know

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:48.976
that, in fact, there'll be no nudity --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.393
(Laughter)

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:54.000
Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.

00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:58.938
(Laughter)

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:02.495
So let me start by talking
about crack cocaine,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:04.193
and how it transformed the gang.

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.905
To do that, you have to actually go
back to a time before crack cocaine,

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.339
in the early '80s, and look at it
from the perspective of a gang leader.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:17.303
Being a gang leader in the inner city
wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:18.820
the early '80s, let me say.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:21.743
Now, you had a lot of power,
and you got to beat people up --

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.299
you got a lot of prestige,
a lot of respect.

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:26.876
But the thing is,
there was no money in it.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.561
The gang had no way to make money.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:30.987
You couldn't charge dues
to the people in the gang,

00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.621
because the people in the gang
didn't have any money.

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:36.253
You couldn't really make any money
selling marijuana --

00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:38.673
marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.

00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:40.563
You can't get rich selling marijuana.

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:42.378
You couldn't sell cocaine;

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:44.816
cocaine's a great product --
powdered cocaine --

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.806
but you've got to know rich white people.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.323
And most of the inner-city gang members
didn't know any rich white people,

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:51.886
so couldn't sell to that market.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.930
You couldn't really do
petty crime, either.

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:56.629
Turns out, petty crime's
a terrible way to make a living.

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:59.808
As a result, as a gang leader,
you had, you know, power --

00:02:59.832 --> 00:03:02.523
it's a pretty good life --
but the thing was, in the end,

00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:04.514
you were living at home with your mother.

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:06.221
And so it wasn't really a career.

00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:09.083
There were limits to how powerful
and important you could be

00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:11.179
if you had to live at home
with your mother.

00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:13.913
Then along comes crack cocaine.

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:17.321
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:21.776
crack cocaine was the extra-chunky
version of tomato sauce

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.951
for the inner city.

00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:23.976
(Laughter)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.504
Because crack cocaine
was an unbelievable innovation.

00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:29.749
I don't have time to talk about it today,
but if you think about it,

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.616
I would say that in the last 25 years,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.776
of every invention or innovation
that's occurred in this country,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.579
the biggest one in terms of impact

00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:40.469
on the well-being of people
who live in the inner city,

00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:41.644
was crack cocaine.

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.449
And for the worse --
not for the better, but for the worse.

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:45.927
It had a huge impact on life.

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:47.815
So what was it about crack cocaine?

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:52.410
It was a brilliant way
of getting the brain high.

00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:57.976
Because you could smoke crack cocaine --
you can't smoke powdered cocaine --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.385
and smoking is a much more efficient
mechanism of delivering a high

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.912
than snorting it.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:07.385
And it turned out there was this audience
that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.181
but when it came, it really did.

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:10.610
And it was a perfect drug;

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:14.810
you could buy the cocaine
that went into it for a dollar,

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.319
sell it for five dollars.

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.671
Highly addictive --
the high was very short.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.367
So for fifteen minutes,
you get this great high,

00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.748
and then when you come down,

00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:25.468
all you want to do is get high again.

00:04:25.492 --> 00:04:27.382
It created a wonderful market.

00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:30.538
And for the people who were there
running the gang,

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.976
it was a great way, seemingly,
to make a lot of money.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.185
At least for the people on the top.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.067
So this is where we enter the picture.

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.596
Not really me -- I'm really
a bit player in all this.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.485
My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh,
is the main character.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.976
He was a math major in college
who had a good heart,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.761
and decided he wanted
to get a sociology PhD,

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:53.414
came to the University of Chicago.

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:56.068
Now, the three months
before he came to Chicago,

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:58.623
he had spent following the Grateful Dead.

00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:02.114
And in his own words,
he "looked like a freak."

00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:06.000
He's a South Asian --
very dark-skinned South Asian.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.096
Big man, and he had hair,
in his words, "down to his ass."

00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:12.514
Defied all kinds of boundaries:

00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:14.776
Was he black or white?
Was he man or woman?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.467
He was really a curious sight to be seen.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.135
So he showed up
at the University of Chicago,

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.842
and the famous sociologist
William Julius Wilson

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:28.000
was doing a book that involved
surveying people all across Chicago.

00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:32.138
He took one look at Sudhir, who was going
to go do some surveys for him,

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:34.532
and decided he knew exactly
the place to send him,

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:37.680
which was to one of the toughest,
most notorious housing projects

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.195
not just in Chicago,
but in the entire United States.

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.888
So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never
really been in the inner city,

00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:48.815
dutifully took his clipboard
and walked down to this housing project,

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.378
gets to the first building.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.240
The first building?
Well, there's nobody there.

00:05:53.264 --> 00:05:56.394
But he hears some voices
up in the stairwell,

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:59.976
so he climbs up the stairwell,
comes around the corner,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.081
and finds a group of young
African-American men playing dice.

00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:08.272
This is about 1990,
peak of the crack epidemic.

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:10.454
This is a very dangerous job,
being in a gang.

00:06:10.478 --> 00:06:11.993
You don't like to be surprised.

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:15.530
You don't like to be surprised
by people who come around the corner.

00:06:15.554 --> 00:06:18.878
And the mantra was:
shoot first; ask questions later.

00:06:18.902 --> 00:06:21.084
Now, Sudhir was lucky --
he was such a freak,

00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:23.319
and that clipboard
probably saved his life,

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:25.566
because they figured no other
rival gang member

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.085
would be coming up to shoot
at them with a clipboard.

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:29.110
(Laughter)

00:06:29.134 --> 00:06:32.165
So his greeting was not particularly
warm, but they did say,

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.832
well, OK -- let's hear
your questions on your survey.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.465
So -- I kid you not --

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:41.276
the first question on the survey
that he was sent to ask was:

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.006
"How do you feel about being
poor and Black in America?"

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.161
(Laughter)

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:48.876
Makes you wonder about academics.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.804
(Laughter)

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.709
So the choice of answers were:

00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:56.380
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]

00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:58.405
(Laughter)

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.934
What Sudhir found out is, in fact,
that the real answer was the following:

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.833
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad
D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.454
(Laughter)

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.998
The survey was not, in the end, going
to be what got Sudhir off the hook.

00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:13.502
He was held hostage
overnight in the stairwell.

00:07:13.526 --> 00:07:14.831
There was a lot of gunfire,

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:18.474
there were a lot of philosophical
discussions he had with the gang members.

00:07:18.498 --> 00:07:20.248
By morning, the gang leader arrived,

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.390
checked out Sudhir,
decided he was no threat,

00:07:22.414 --> 00:07:23.636
and they let him go home.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.788
So Sudhir went home,
took a shower, took a nap.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:31.611
And you and I, probably, faced
with the situation, would think,

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.707
"I guess I'm going to write
my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,

00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.170
I've been following them
for the last three months."

00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:38.202
(Laughter)

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:39.485
Sudhir, on the other hand,

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.930
got right back, walked
down to the housing project,

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:43.297
went up to the second floor,

00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:47.223
and said: "Hey, guys, I had so much fun
hanging out with you last night,

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:49.225
I wonder if I could do it again tonight."

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:52.880
And that was the beginning of what turned
out to be a beautiful relationship

00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:56.499
that involved Sudhir living in the housing
project on and off for 10 years,

00:07:56.523 --> 00:08:01.278
hanging out in crack houses,
going to jail with the gang members,

00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:03.840
having the windows shot out of his car,

00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:07.362
having the police break into his apartment
and steal his computer disks --

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.544
you name it.

00:08:08.568 --> 00:08:11.384
But ultimately, the story
has a happy ending for Sudhir,

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.651
who became one of the most
respected sociologists in the country.

00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:16.044
And especially for me,

00:08:16.068 --> 00:08:19.487
as I sat in my office
with my Excel spreadsheet open,

00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:22.848
waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver
to me the latest load of data

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:24.758
that he would get from the gang.

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:28.551
(Laughter)

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.979
It was one of the most unequal
co-authoring relationships ever --

00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:33.023
(Laughter)

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:36.538
But I was glad to be
the beneficiary of it.

00:08:36.562 --> 00:08:37.936
So what did we find?

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:40.341
What did we find in the gang?

00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.457
Well, let me say one thing:

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:46.084
We really got access
to everybody in the gang.

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:50.432
We got an inside look at the gang,
from the very bottom up to the very top.

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:55.442
They trusted Sudhir, in ways
that really no academic has ever --

00:08:55.466 --> 00:09:00.018
or really anybody, any outsider --
has ever earned the trust of these gangs,

00:09:00.042 --> 00:09:02.499
to the point where they actually opened up

00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:04.780
what was most interesting
for me -- their books,

00:09:04.804 --> 00:09:06.343
the financial records they kept.

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:09.439
They made them available to us,
and we not only could study them,

00:09:09.463 --> 00:09:12.059
but we could ask them questions
about what was in them.

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:15.509
So if I have to kind of summarize
very quickly in the short time I have

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:19.483
what the bottom line of what
I take away from the gang is,

00:09:19.507 --> 00:09:22.217
it's that, if I had to draw
a parallel between the gang

00:09:22.241 --> 00:09:24.360
and any other organization,

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:27.675
it would be that the gang
is just like McDonald's,

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:30.548
in a lot of different respects --
the restaurant McDonald's.

00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:32.190
So first, in one way,

00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:35.829
which isn't maybe the most interesting
way, but it's a good way to start --

00:09:35.853 --> 00:09:38.499
is in the way it's organized,
the hierarchy of the gang,

00:09:38.523 --> 00:09:39.674
the way it looks.

00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:42.152
So here's what the org chart
of the gang looks like.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:44.383
I don't know if you know much
about org charts,

00:09:44.407 --> 00:09:48.114
but if you were to assign a stripped-down
and simplified McDonald's org chart,

00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:50.092
this is exactly what it would look like.

00:09:50.116 --> 00:09:52.310
It's amazing, but the top
level of the gang,

00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:54.961
they actually call themselves
the "Board of Directors."

00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.064
(Laughter)

00:09:56.088 --> 00:09:58.035
And Sudhir says

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:01.453
it's not like these guys
had a very sophisticated view

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.942
of what happened
in American corporate life,

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:07.031
but they had seen movies
like "Wall Street,"

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:10.430
and they had learned a little bit
about what it was like

00:10:10.454 --> 00:10:12.405
to be in the real world.

00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:14.263
Now, below that board of directors,

00:10:14.287 --> 00:10:16.692
you've got essentially
what are regional VPs --

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:20.501
people who control, say, the South Side
of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.

00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:23.976
Sudhir got to know very well the guy
who had the unfortunate assignment

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.339
of trying to take the Iowa franchise,

00:10:26.363 --> 00:10:28.424
which, it turned out, for this black gang,

00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:32.546
was not one of the more brilliant
financial endeavors they undertook.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.824
(Laughter)

00:10:33.848 --> 00:10:38.144
But the thing that really makes the gang
seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.

00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:42.508
The guys who are running
the local gangs --

00:10:42.532 --> 00:10:45.483
the four-square-block
by four-square-block areas --

00:10:45.507 --> 00:10:49.009
they're just like the guys, in some sense,
who are running the McDonald's.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.502
They are the entrepreneurs.

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:54.262
They get the exclusive property rights
to control the drug-selling.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:11:00.798
They get the name of the gang behind them,
for merchandising and marketing.

00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:04.639
And they're the ones who basically
make the profit or lose a profit,

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:07.242
depending on how good
they are at running the business.

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:10.171
Now, the group I really want you
to think about, though,

00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:12.448
are the ones at the bottom --
the foot soldiers.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:14.520
These are the teenagers, typically,

00:11:14.544 --> 00:11:17.568
who'd be standing out on the street
corner, selling the drugs.

00:11:17.592 --> 00:11:20.012
Extremely dangerous work.

00:11:20.036 --> 00:11:25.414
And important to note is that almost all
of the weight, all of the people

00:11:25.438 --> 00:11:28.495
in this organization are at the bottom --
just like McDonald's.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.479
So in some sense, the foot soldiers
are a lot like the people

00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:33.469
who are taking your order at McDonald's,

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:35.931
and it's not just by chance
that they're like them.

00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:38.756
In fact, in these neighborhoods,
they'd be the same people.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.681
So the same kids who are working
in the gang were actually,

00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:44.464
at the very same time,
typically working part-time

00:11:44.488 --> 00:11:46.019
at a place like McDonald's.

00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:49.434
Which already foreshadows
the main result that I've talked about,

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.548
about what a crappy job
it was, being in the gang.

00:11:52.572 --> 00:11:56.223
Because obviously, if being in the gang
were such a wonderful, lucrative job,

00:11:56.247 --> 00:11:59.491
why in the world would these guys
moonlight at McDonald's?

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:02.563
So what do the wages look like?
You might be surprised.

00:12:02.587 --> 00:12:06.214
But based on being able to talk to them
and to see their records,

00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:08.708
this is what it looks
like in terms of the wages.

00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:12.822
The hourly wage the foot soldiers
were earning was $3.50 an hour.

00:12:12.846 --> 00:12:16.235
It was below the minimum wage.
And this is well-documented.

00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:19.122
It's easy to see by the patterns
of consumption they have.

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:22.121
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:25.976
There was very little money in the gang,
especially at the bottom.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.385
Now if you managed to rise up, say,
and be that local leader,

00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:32.146
the guy who's the equivalent
of the McDonald's franchisee,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.055
you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:37.405
And that, in some ways,
was the best job you could hope to get

00:12:37.429 --> 00:12:41.087
if you were growing up in one of these
neighborhoods as a young black male.

00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:43.006
If you managed to rise to the very top,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.955
200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year
is what you'd hope to make.

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:48.708
Truly, you would be a great success story.

00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:51.808
And one of the sad parts
of this is that, indeed,

00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:54.377
among the many other
ramifications of crack cocaine

00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:58.531
is that the most talented individuals
in these communities --

00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:00.286
this is what they were striving for.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.778
They weren't trying to make it
in legitimate ways,

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:04.992
because there were
no legitimate channels out.

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:06.389
This was the best way out.

00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:09.084
And it actually was
the right choice, probably,

00:13:09.108 --> 00:13:12.434
to try to make it out this way.

00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:14.401
You look at this,

00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:17.344
the relationship to McDonald's
breaks down here.

00:13:17.368 --> 00:13:19.303
The money looks about the same.

00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:20.769
Why is it such a bad job?

00:13:20.793 --> 00:13:24.509
Well, the reason it's such a bad job
is that there's somebody shooting at you

00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:26.095
a lot of the time.

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:28.976
So, with shooting at you,
what are the death rates?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.157
We found, in our gang --

00:13:30.181 --> 00:13:33.417
and admittedly, this was not really
a standard situation;

00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:37.883
this was a time of intense violence,
of a lot of gang wars,

00:13:37.907 --> 00:13:40.566
as this gang actually
became quite successful.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.826
But there were costs.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.595
And so the death rate --

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:48.579
not to mention the rate of being arrested,
sent to prison, being wounded --

00:13:48.603 --> 00:13:53.308
the death rate in our sample
was seven percent per person per year.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:55.063
You're in the gang for four years,

00:13:55.087 --> 00:13:59.603
you expect to die
with about a 25 percent likelihood.

00:13:59.627 --> 00:14:01.729
That is about as high as you can get.

00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:03.600
So for comparison's purposes,

00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:08.626
let's think about some other walk of life
you may expect might be extremely risky.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.642
Let's say that you were a murderer

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:13.867
and you were convicted of murder,
and you're sent to death row.

00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:17.860
It turns out, the death rates on death row
from all causes, including execution:

00:14:17.884 --> 00:14:19.040
two percent a year.

00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:20.065
(Laughter)

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:23.722
So it's a lot safer being on death row

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.306
than it is selling drugs
out on the street.

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:29.722
That gives you some pause,
for those of you who believe

00:14:29.746 --> 00:14:34.429
that a death penalty's going to have
an enormous deterrent effect on crime.

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:38.871
To give you a sense of just how bad
the inner city was during crack --

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:41.629
and I'm not really focusing
on the negatives,

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:44.573
but really, there's another story
to tell you there --

00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:48.335
if you look at the death rates
just of random, young black males

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:50.746
growing up in the inner city
in the United States,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.546
the death rates during crack
were about one percent.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.722
That's extremely high.

00:14:54.746 --> 00:14:57.737
And this is violent death --
it's unbelievable, in some sense.

00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:02.491
To put it into perspective: if you compare
this to the soldiers in Iraq,

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:06.181
for instance, right now
fighting the war: 0.5 percent.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:09.242
So in some very literal way,

00:15:09.266 --> 00:15:12.174
the young black men who were
growing up in this country

00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:14.011
were living in a war zone,

00:15:14.035 --> 00:15:20.805
very much in the sense that the soldiers
over in Iraq are fighting in a war.

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:23.844
So why in the world, you might ask,

00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:27.663
would anybody be willing
to stand out on a street corner

00:15:27.687 --> 00:15:29.976
selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.976
with a 25 percent chance of dying
over the next four years?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.935
Why would they do that?

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:37.330
And I think there are a couple answers.

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:43.164
I think the first one
is that they got fooled by history.

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:45.830
It used to be the gang
was a rite of passage;

00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:47.888
that the young people controlled the gang;

00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:50.597
that as you got older,
you dropped out of the gang.

00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:52.639
So what happened was,

00:15:52.663 --> 00:15:55.941
the people who happened to be
in the right place at the right time --

00:15:55.965 --> 00:16:01.381
the people who happened to be leading
the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:03.364
became very, very wealthy.

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:05.492
And so the logical thing to think

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:08.640
was that they are going
to age out of the gang

00:16:08.664 --> 00:16:09.861
like everybody else has,

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:13.000
and the next generation is going
to take over and get the wealth.

00:16:13.024 --> 00:16:16.009
There are striking similarities,
I think, to the Internet boom.

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:19.259
The first set of people in Silicon Valley
got very, very rich.

00:16:19.283 --> 00:16:23.373
And then all of my friends said,
"Maybe I should go do that, too."

00:16:23.397 --> 00:16:28.001
And they were willing to work very cheap
for stock options that never came.

00:16:28.025 --> 00:16:30.399
In some sense,
that's what happened, exactly,

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:33.937
to the set of people we were looking at.

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:36.156
They were willing to start at the bottom,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.237
just like, say, a first-year
lawyer at a law firm

00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:41.432
is willing to start at the bottom,

00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:43.519
work 80-hour weeks
for not that much money,

00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:45.852
because they think
they're going to make partner.

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:48.662
But the rules changed,
and they never got to make partner.

00:16:48.686 --> 00:16:52.545
Indeed, the same people who were running
all of the major gangs in the late 1980s

00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:54.975
are still running the major gangs
in Chicago today.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:56.882
They never passed on any of the wealth,

00:16:56.906 --> 00:16:59.750
So everybody got stuck
at that $3.50-an-hour job,

00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:01.693
and it turned out to be a disaster.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.573
The other thing the gang was
very good at was marketing and trickery.

00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:10.245
And so for instance,
one thing the gang would do is --

00:17:10.269 --> 00:17:12.501
the gang leaders would have
big entourages,

00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:15.737
and they'd drive fancy cars
and have fancy jewelry.

00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:18.847
So what Sudhir eventually realized
as he hung out with them more,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:22.131
is that, really, they didn't own
those cars -- they just leased them,

00:17:22.155 --> 00:17:24.834
because they couldn't afford
to own the fancy cars.

00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:28.320
And they didn't really have gold jewelry,
they had gold-plated jewelry.

00:17:28.344 --> 00:17:31.704
It goes back to, you know,
the real-real versus the fake-real.

00:17:31.728 --> 00:17:35.690
And really, they did all sorts
of things to trick the young people

00:17:35.714 --> 00:17:38.507
into thinking what a great deal
the gang was going to be.

00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:41.322
So for instance, they would give
a 14-year-old kid

00:17:41.346 --> 00:17:44.472
a whole roll of bills to hold.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:47.326
That 14-year-old kid
would say to his friends,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.557
"Hey, look at all the money
I got in the gang."

00:17:49.581 --> 00:17:51.558
It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,

00:17:51.582 --> 00:17:53.301
and then he was in debt to the gang,

00:17:53.325 --> 00:17:55.714
and was sort of an indentured
servant for a while.

00:17:55.738 --> 00:17:57.288
So I have a couple minutes.

00:17:57.312 --> 00:18:01.357
Let me do one last thing
I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:06.635
which is to talk about what we learned
more generally about economics,

00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:08.666
from the study of the gang.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.245
So, economists tend to talk
in technical words.

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.870
Often, our theories fail quite miserably
when we over the data,

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:18.680
but what's kind of interesting
is that in this setting,

00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:21.021
it turned out that
some of the economic theories

00:18:21.045 --> 00:18:23.180
that worked not so well
in the real economy

00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:25.394
worked very well in the drug economy,

00:18:25.418 --> 00:18:27.784
in some sense, because
it's unfettered capitalism.

00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:29.201
Here's an economic principle.

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:31.567
This is one of the basic ideas
in labor economics,

00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:33.375
called a "compensating differential."

00:18:33.399 --> 00:18:36.841
It's the idea that the increment to wages
that a worker requires

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:39.479
to leave him indifferent
between performing two tasks,

00:18:39.503 --> 00:18:41.608
one which is more unpleasant
than the other.

00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:45.278
Compensating differential -- it's why
we think garbagemen might be paid more

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:46.836
than people who work in parks.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.782
The words of one of the members
of the gang, I think, make this clear.

00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:55.496
So it turns out -- I'm sort
of getting ahead of myself --

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.673
it turns out, in the gang,
when there's a war going on,

00:18:58.697 --> 00:19:01.714
they actually pay the foot soldiers
twice as much money.

00:19:01.738 --> 00:19:03.027
It's exactly this concept.

00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:05.683
Because they're not willing to be at risk.

00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:08.729
And the words of a gang member
capture it quite nicely, he says:

00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:12.103
"Would you stand around here when all
this shit ..." -- the shooting --

00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:14.240
"... if all this shit's
going on? No, right?

00:19:14.264 --> 00:19:18.070
So if I gonna be asked to put my life
on the line, then front me the cash, man."

00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:20.642
I think the gang member says it
much more articulately

00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:22.683
than the economist, about what's going on.

00:19:22.707 --> 00:19:24.322
(Laughter)

00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:25.976
Here's another one.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.642
Economists talk about game theory,

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.024
that every two-person game
has a Nash equilibrium.

00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:32.506
Here's the translation
you get from the gang member.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.883
They're talking about the decision
of why they don't go shoot --

00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:39.773
One thing that turns out to be a great
business tactic in the gang:

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:43.679
if you go and just shoot guns in the air
in the other gang's territory --

00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:45.644
people are afraid to go buy drugs there,

00:19:45.668 --> 00:19:47.776
they're going to come
into your neighborhood.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.096
Here's what he says
about why they don't do that:

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.141
"If we start shooting around there,
the other gang's territory,

00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:56.048
nobody, I mean, you dig it,
nobody gonna step on their turf.

00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:57.224
But we gotta be careful,

00:19:57.248 --> 00:20:00.174
'cause they can shoot around here too
and then we all fucked."

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.199
(Laughter)

00:20:01.223 --> 00:20:02.521
So that's the same concept.

00:20:02.545 --> 00:20:04.759
Then again, sometimes
economists get it wrong.

00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:09.454
One thing we observed in the data
is that it looked like --

00:20:09.478 --> 00:20:12.758
the gang leader always got paid.

00:20:12.782 --> 00:20:17.234
No matter how bad it was economically,
he always got himself paid.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.408
We had some theories related to cash flow,

00:20:19.432 --> 00:20:22.263
and lack of access to capital markets,
and things like that.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.723
Then we asked the gang member,

00:20:23.747 --> 00:20:27.100
"Why is it you always get paid
and your workers don't always get paid?"

00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:28.275
His response is,

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:31.386
"You got all these niggers below you
who want your job, you dig?

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.193
If you start taking losses,
they see you as weak and shit."

00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:35.765
And I thought about it and said,

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:39.430
"CEOs often pay themselves
million-dollar bonuses,

00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:41.766
even when companies
are losing a lot of money.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.005
And it never would really occur
to an economist

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:46.925
that this idea of 'weak and shit'
could really be important."

00:20:46.949 --> 00:20:50.215
(Laughter)

00:20:50.239 --> 00:20:55.976
Maybe "weak and shit" is an important
hypothesis that needs more analysis.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.151
Thank you very much.

00:20:57.175 --> 00:20:58.175
(Applause)
