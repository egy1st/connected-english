00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.747
A long time ago,

00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:04.519
I was a professional animator.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.723
(Music)

00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:09.653
[Eric Dyer]

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:10.687
[Animator]

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.861
[Compositor]

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.151
And at night,

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:20.458
I would make my own experimental films.

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:21.535
(Music)

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:26.190
And I was spending a lot of time,
way too much time, in front of a screen

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:28.909
for work that would be
presented on a screen,

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.656
and I had this great need
to get my hands back on the work again.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.461
Now, before "The Simpsons,"

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:37.641
before "Gumby,"

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.343
before "Betty Boop,"

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.823
before there was such a thing
as cinema and television,

00:00:42.847 --> 00:00:45.771
animation was hugely popular in this form.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.426
This is a zoetrope.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.231
And you spin this drum,

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:52.124
and you look through the slits
into the inside of the drum,

00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:54.273
and you see the animation pop to life.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.490
This is animation in physical form,

00:00:57.514 --> 00:01:00.797
and it's animation I could
get my hands on again.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.290
I took these ideas to Denmark.

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:06.168
I went there with my family
on a Fulbright Fellowship.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.355
That's my daughter, Mia.

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:13.412
I rode around the city on my bicycle

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:16.775
and shot all the interesting
moving elements of Copenhagen:

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:20.888
the boaters in the canals,

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.120
the colors that explode in spring,

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.344
the free-use city bikes,

00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:28.060
love,

00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:29.857
textures,

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:31.675
the healthy cuisine --

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:32.849
(Laughter)

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:37.881
And I brought all that video
back into the physical world

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:40.595
by printing it out on these long
strips of ink-jet paper

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.927
and cutting out the forms.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.668
Now, I invented my own
form of the zoetrope,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.869
which removes the drum

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:54.688
and replaces the slits
with a video camera.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.767
And this was very exciting for me,

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.975
because it meant that I could
make these physical objects,

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.346
and I could make films from those objects.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.347
That's me riding on my bicycle.

00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.521
(Laughter)

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:19.175
I made about 25 paper sculptures,

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.196
each the size of a bicycle wheel.

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.697
I brought them into the studio,

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.911
spun them

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:29.179
and shot them to make the film
"Copenhagen Cycles."

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:32.064
(Music)

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:41.714
This project not only allowed me
to get my hands back on the work again

00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:43.640
but it helped me get my life back.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:49.609
Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day
with my face plastered to a screen,

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:53.192
I was having these little adventures
with our new family

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:55.976
and shooting video along the way,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.121
and it was kind of a symbiosis
of art and life.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.728
And I think that it's no mistake

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:05.578
that zoetrope translates
into "wheel of life."

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.602
(Music)

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.674
But film and video does flatten sculpture,

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:15.726
so I tried to imagine

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.678
a way that animated sculpture
could be experienced as such,

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:23.749
and also a completely immersive
kind of animated sculpture.

00:03:23.773 --> 00:03:27.443
And that's where I came up with the idea
for the zoetrope tunnel.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:29.923
You walk through with a handheld strobe,

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.039
and wherever you point the flashlight,

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:33.540
the animation pops to life.

00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:37.703
I plan to finish this project
in the next 30 to 40 years.

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:38.877
(Laughter)

00:03:40.204 --> 00:03:43.113
But I did build a half-scale prototype.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.163
It's covered in Velcro,

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:49.703
and I could lay inside on this bridge

00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:53.049
and stick animated sequences to the walls

00:03:53.073 --> 00:03:54.313
and test stuff out.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.418
People would comment
that it reminded them of an MRI.

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:04.358
And that medical connection spoke to me,

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:05.903
because at the age of 14,

00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:08.500
I was diagnosed with
a degenerative retinal condition

00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:11.006
that's slowly taking my vision away,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.495
and I'd never responded
to that in my work.

00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:17.790
So I responded to it
in this piece called, "Implant."

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.913
It is an imaginary,
super-magnified medical device

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:24.940
that fits around the optic nerve.

00:04:26.828 --> 00:04:30.631
And the public is, in a sense,
miniaturized to experience it.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.951
With a handheld strobe,

00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:41.033
they can explore the sculpture,

00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:46.023
and discover thousands
of cell-sized robots

00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:49.327
hard at work, leaping
in and out of the optic nerve,

00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:50.751
being deployed to the retina

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:51.925
to repair it.

00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:56.752
It's my science fiction fantasy cure
of my own incurable disorder.

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:58.718
(Machine buzzes)

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.685
Now, in the real-world gene therapy
and gene therapy research,

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:08.310
healthy genes are being administered
to unhealthy cells using viruses.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.002
There's a lot of colorful,
fluffy hope in this,

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:16.405
and there's also some creepy,
threatening idea

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.535
of viruses maybe becoming
an invasive species in your body.

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.055
Vision loss has helped
to take me away from the things

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.342
that disconnect me from the world.

00:05:31.232 --> 00:05:33.538
Instead of being sealed off
in an automobile,

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:35.235
I ride my bike,

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.897
take buses and trains

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:38.319
and walk a lot.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.739
And instead of a visually intensive
process in the studio, primarily,

00:05:43.763 --> 00:05:46.349
I'm also getting outdoors a lot more

00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:48.121
and using more of my senses.

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:53.779
This landscape is a couple hours east
of San Diego, California.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:55.448
My brother lives out that way.

00:05:56.788 --> 00:05:59.493
He and I went camping there for four days.

00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:02.665
And I grabbed my camera,

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.615
and I walked through the canyons.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.685
And I tried to imagine and figure out

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.807
what kind of motion would be present

00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:15.385
in this place that was so still
and so devoid of motion.

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.658
I think it's the stillest
place I've ever been.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:23.510
And I realized that it was the movement
of my own body through the landscape

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:25.195
that was creating the animation.

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.831
It was the motion of changing perspective.

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:31.793
So I created this piece called "Mud Caves"
from those photographs.

00:06:32.342 --> 00:06:34.817
It's a multilayered print piece,

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:37.484
and you can think of it as
a zoetrope laid flat.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.541
It's kind of my western
landscape panorama.

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.169
And next to the print piece
there's a video monitor

00:06:45.193 --> 00:06:48.672
that shows the animation
hidden within the artwork.

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.999
I think one of the best parts
about this project for me

00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:54.682
was that I got to hang out
with my brother a lot,

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:57.247
who lives 2,500 miles away from me.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.437
And we would just sit
in this seemingly eternal landscape

00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:05.237
sculpted by water over millions of years

00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:06.411
and talk.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.102
We'd talk about our kids growing up

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:11.687
and the slowing pace of our parents,

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:16.828
and our dad who's suffering from leukemia,
memory loss and infection.

00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:20.473
And it struck me that, as individuals,

00:07:20.497 --> 00:07:22.070
we're finite,

00:07:22.094 --> 00:07:23.546
but as a family,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.688
we are an ongoing cycle --

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.579
a kind of wheel of life.

00:07:28.896 --> 00:07:32.819
Now, I want to leave you with a tribute
to one of my mentors.

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:38.995
She reminds me that physical
presence is important

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:42.373
and that play is not a luxury,

00:07:42.397 --> 00:07:43.681
but a necessity.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:51.953
She's Pixie,

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:55.133
and she's our family dog.

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.746
And she loves to jump.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.150
(Dog barking)

00:08:02.174 --> 00:08:04.637
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:11.281
And this is a new kind of zoetrope

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:13.584
that I developed
at the Imaging Research Center

00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:15.128
at UMBC in Baltimore.

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:19.328
And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."

00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:21.935
(Dog barking)

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.325
(Dog barking and spring boinging)

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.881
Thank you.

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:28.058
(Applause)
