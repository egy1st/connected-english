00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about opening the space frontier.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I want to tell you that story.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have something called the Genome 100 --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Craig Venter chairs that event.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I met Professor Hawking,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and he said his dream was to travel into space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I said, "I can't take you there,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You do it again and again.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We set out to do this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It took us 11 years to become operational.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And he wanted to go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We worked hard to get all the permissions.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We had a press conference,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
give him 25 seconds of zero-g.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And what he said, for me, was very moving.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
of being wiped out by disaster ...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We had about 20 people who made donations --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who flew with us.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
A few TEDsters here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We set up a whole ER.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We took off from the shuttle landing facility,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
where the shuttle takes off and lands.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
carefully suspended him into zero-g.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Once he was there, [we] let him go

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to experience what weightlessness was truly like.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And after that first parabola, you know,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So we did a second parabola.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
(Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
(Applause)

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And a third.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(Applause)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that Isaac Newton did.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And a seventh and an eighth.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
He was so happy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We are living on a precious jewel,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Please join us in this epic adventure.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Thank you so much.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
(Applause)
