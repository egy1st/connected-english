00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.674
Everyone likes to spend time alone.

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:14.283
I bet all of you in this room
can think about a time

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:18.621
when all you really wanted to do was
stay home alone and watch a good movie.

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.472
I definitely can.

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:24.882
This joy we have from spending time alone
is something that we all understand.

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.563
Yet, in our society nowadays,

00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:29.903
it is something that is
extremely stigmatized.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.563
I'm sure you can all think about a time

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.023
when your friends showered you
with reproving looks

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:38.231
when you told them that, no,
you weren't going to this party tonight

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.424
because you just didn't feel
like being social.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:42.375
I definitely can.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.444
Those looks, however,
managed to make us feel so guilty

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.062
that, in the end, just a few hours later,

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:52.541
we find ourselves surrounded by them
in a room filled with music and laughter.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.613
I just want to emphasize here

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:57.634
that I do not mean to say
that you'd be unhappy at that party.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:01.014
You may be having the time of your life.
Totally amazing for you.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:02.834
What I do want to remind you, however,

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:06.385
is that, initially, going to this party
wasn't your first choice.

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:09.915
You wanted to stay home alone
and watch a really good movie.

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:13.229
So, why didn't you pursue
what you wanted to do?

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.964
Because you were scared of the stigma
surrounding spending time alone.

00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:20.694
This stigma can be summarized
in an extremely simple equation:

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:24.622
spending time alone equals having
no friends, plus being antisocial,

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:28.351
and nobody wants to be recognized
as a person without friends.

00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:30.845
This idea we all associate
with spending time alone

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:34.564
is so embedded in our society
that we prefer conforming to the norms

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:37.552
rather than doing the thing
we truly want to do.

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.385
What many people might not know, however,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:43.734
is that spending time alone
is actually very beneficial.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.166
That's why I'm standing here
in front of you today,

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.043
to prove to you that "me time"
is worth fighting for.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.499
The first thing we gain
from spending time alone is creativity.

00:01:54.837 --> 00:02:00.136
As Keith Sawyer, a psychologist
at WUSTL, pointed out,

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:01.956
decades of research have shown

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.995
that brainstorming groups of people
think of far fewer ideas

00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:09.286
than that same number of people
who work alone and later pull their ideas.

00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:11.377
This may sound counter-intuitive

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:13.676
because you'd think
you'd come up with more ideas

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.775
when surrounded by other people.

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:17.578
However, if you're on your own,

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:20.996
you will allow yourself the time
to formulate your own opinion on stuff

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:24.584
and to also let your mind wander to places
it probably wouldn't have gone to

00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:27.218
if you had been surrounded
by other people's opinions,

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:30.936
because other people's opinions would have
necessarily influenced your own.

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:34.626
This increased creativity we gain
from spending time alone

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:38.518
has also been proven
in a study done in 2012.

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:42.567
In this experiment, 56 adults were
immersed into nature for four days,

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:45.047
without any form of technology.

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.905
What they gained from this
is that they became 50% better

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:50.105
at creative problem-solving.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.167
So, if you allow yourself "me time,"
you'll become more creative.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:54.818
Pretty appealing, no?

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:57.988
Another bonus point we get
from spending time alone

00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:00.259
is that it makes us work harder.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.691
We always have a tendency to do less
when we're surrounded by other people.

00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:09.360
I mean, teachers, there's a reason
why students love group work,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.729
or at least part of them.

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.214
I don't know if you've noticed,

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:15.329
but when you say "group work,"
half of the class looks like this -

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.344
and the other half, like this.

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:21.541
You can probably guess who's going
to end up doing all the work in the end.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:25.008
This tendency we have to work less
when surrounded by other people

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:28.538
has been termed "social loafing"
by Max Ringelmann.

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:30.955
In the 1890s, this guy set up a study

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:34.231
in which he made an increasing amount
of people pull on a rope.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:35.563
In each of his experiments,

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:39.589
he measured the effort each person
pulled on the rope.

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:43.300
What we can see on this graph
is that the more people were in each group

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.422
the less force each
individual person exerted.

00:03:46.422 --> 00:03:51.471
So, if allow yourself "me time,"
you'll work harder.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.941
And if this doesn't convince you enough,

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:56.152
just think about spending
time alone and sleep.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.652
And who doesn't love sleep?

00:03:57.652 --> 00:04:00.751
Because, honestly,
that's basicaly what it is.

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.293
When you sleep, you take the time
to recharge before you start another day.

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:06.922
When you spend time alone,
you take the time to recharge

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:08.900
from all your social interactions.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.853
Alone time and sleep
seem really similar to me.

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.258
So, to summarize,

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.547
spending time alone
will make you more creative,

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:19.618
will make you work harder
and can be regarded as sleep.

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:23.019
Those reasons seem
all really good ones to stay in.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:25.238
There however remains one tiny thing

00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:28.008
that prevents us from spending
the time alone that we need.

00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:30.470
And I'm not talking
about the stigma surrounding it.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.210
I'm talking about this thing called FOMO,
or "fear of missing out."

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.960
You've probably heard of it already.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.119
You know, it's that feeling you get
when you're invited to a party,

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:42.520
but all you really want to do
is stay home alone.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.380
Yet, you still go because, otherwise,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.469
you're scared that you won't belong
to the "cool group" anymore.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.078
However, I hope that,
after having listened to my [TEDx] talk,

00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:55.156
you will understand that spending
time alone is actually really beneficial.

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:56.930
So, stop feeling scared and guilty

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.110
if you don't want to be
around other people.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.762
You have all the reasons to.
Thank you very much.

00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:03.472
(Applause)
