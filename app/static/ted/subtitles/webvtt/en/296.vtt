♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo. ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
♫ They have a tumor on their funny bone. ♫

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
♫ They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
♫ Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. ♫

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what’s wrong with that? ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ Can't these chicks do anything but whine? ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
♫ Dance break! Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫

♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum. ♫

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
♫ They say cheap objectification isn’t witty -- it’s hot! ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
♫ Equal work and wages worth the fight -- ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
♫ sing us a new one. ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
♫ On-demand abortion every city -- OK, but no gun control. ♫

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
♫ Won’t these women ever get a life? ♫

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
♫ Feminists don’t have a sense of humor -- poor Hillary. ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac. ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham, ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
♫ that's why these feminists just need to find a man. ♫

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I asked my mother, you know, should I say anything in support of anyone?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And she said, "Oh no! Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ I could show the world how to smile, ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ I could be glad all of the while. ♫

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:41.000
♫ I could turn the gray skies to blue, if I had you. ♫

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
♫ I could leave the old days behind, ♫

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.000
♫ leave all my pals, I’d never mind. ♫

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:10.000
♫ I could start my life all anew, if I had you. ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
♫ I could climb the snow-capped mountains, ♫

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000
♫ sail the mighty ocean wide. ♫

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:39.000
♫ I could cross the burning desert, if I had you by my side. ♫

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:55.000
♫ I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or poor, rich or renowned. ♫

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:13.000
♫ There is nothing I couldn’t do, if I had you. ♫

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
