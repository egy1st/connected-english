00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.936
Some of you have heard the story before,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.136
but, in fact, there's somebody
in the audience

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.016
who's never heard this story
in front of an audience before,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.776
so I'm a little more nervous
than I normally am telling this story.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.896
I used to be a photographer
for many years.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.776
In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.936
and I was given a three-day assignment
to photograph Amerasian children,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.296
children who had been fathered
by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.656
and then abandoned --
40,000 children all over Asia.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.760
I had never heard
the word Amerasian before.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.056
I spent a few days photographing
children in different countries,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.336
and like a lot of photographers
and a lot of journalists,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.816
I always hoped that
when my pictures are published,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.216
they might actually
have an effect on a situation,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.776
instead of just documenting it.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.056
So, I was so disturbed by what I saw

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.176
and I was so unhappy
with the article that ran afterwards,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.656
that I decided
I would take six months off.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.096
I was 28 years old.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.856
I decided I would find
six children in different countries,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.056
and actually go spend
some time with the kids,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.296
and try to tell their story
a little bit better

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.480
than I thought I had done
for Time magazine.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.936
In the course of doing the story,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.616
I was looking for children
who hadn't been photographed before,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.576
and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me
that they worked with a lot of Americans

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.016
who were donating money
to help some of these kids.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.296
And a man told me,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.976
who ran the Pearl Buck
Foundation in Korea,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.376
that there was a young girl,
who was 11 years old,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.976
being raised by her grandmother.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.696
And the grandmother
had never let any Westerners see her.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.776
Every time any Westerners
came to the village, she hid the girl.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.696
Of course, I was immediately intrigued.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.296
I saw photographs of her
and I thought I wanted to go.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.576
And the guy just told me,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.576
"This grandmother -- there's no way
she's ever going to let you

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.416
meet this girl that's she's raising."

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.936
I took a translator with me
and went to this village,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.936
found the grandmother, sat down with her.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.456
And to my astonishment, she agreed
to let me photograph her granddaughter.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.296
And I was paying for this myself,
so I asked the translator

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.336
if it would be OK
if I stayed for the week.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.976
I had a sleeping bag.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.696
The family had a small shed
on the side of the house,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.896
so I said, "Could I sleep
in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.856
And I just told the little girl,
whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.096
that if I ever did anything
to embarrass her --

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.536
she didn't speak a word of English,
although she looked very American --

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.136
she could put up her hand and say, "Stop,"
and I would stop taking pictures.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.976
Then my translator left.
I couldn't speak a word of Korean.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.936
This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.296
Her mother was still alive.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.016
She was not raising her,
her grandmother was raising her.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.336
And what struck me immediately

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.816
was how in love
the two of these people were.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.056
The grandmother was incredibly fond,
deeply in love with this little girl.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.696
They slept on the floor at night.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.176
The way they heat their homes in Korea
is to put bricks under the floors,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.416
so the heat radiates
from underneath the floor.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.776
Eun-Sook was 11 years old.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.216
I had photographed,
as I said, a lot of these kids.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.216
Eun-Sook was the fifth child
that I found to photograph.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.776
And almost universally,
amongst all the kids,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.496
they were really psychologically damaged

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.336
by having been made fun of,
ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.136
And Korea was probably the place
I found to be the worst for these kids.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.336
And what struck me immediately
in meeting Eun-Sook

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.176
was how confident she appeared to be,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.416
how happy she seemed to be
in her own skin.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.696
And remember this picture,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.176
because I'm going to show you
another picture later.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.376
She looks much like her grandmother,
although she looks so Western.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.056
I decided to follow her to school.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.176
This is the first morning
I stayed with her.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.616
This is on the way to school.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.080
This is the morning assembly
outside her school.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.336
And I noticed that
she was clowning around.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.216
When the teachers would ask questions,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.656
she'd be the first person
to raise her hand.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.616
Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.376
or anything like the other children
that I'd photographed.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.136
The first one to go
to the blackboard to answer questions.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.096
Getting in trouble for whispering
into her best friend's ears.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.296
And one of the other things
I said to her through the translator --

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.896
again, this thing about saying stop --
was to not pay attention to me.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.736
So she really just completely
ignored me most of the time.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.976
I noticed that at recess,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.816
she was the girl who picked
the other girls to be on her team.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.816
It was very obvious, from the beginning,
that she was a leader.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.976
This is on the way home.
And that's North Korea up along the hill.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.216
This is up along the DMZ.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.616
They would actually
cover the windows every night,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.176
so that light couldn't be seen,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.736
because the South Korean government
has said for years

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.935
that the North Koreans
may invade at any time.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.256
So the closer you were to North Korea,
the more terrifying it was.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.576
Very often at school,
I'd be taking pictures,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.936
and she would whisper
into her girlfriends' ears,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.776
and then look at me and say, "Stop."

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.856
And I would stand at attention,
and all the girls would crack up,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.496
and it was sort of a little joke.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.896
(Laughter)

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.416
The end of the week came
and my translator came back,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.136
because I'd asked her to come back,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.896
so I could formally thank
the grandmother and Eun-Sook.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.176
And in the course of the grandmother
talking to the translator,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.896
the grandmother started crying.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.056
And I said to my translator,
"What's going on, why is she crying?"

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.256
And she spoke to
the grandmother for a moment,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.496
and then she started
getting tears in her eyes.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.976
And I said, "What did I do?
Why is everyone crying?"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.216
And the translator said,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.056
"The grandmother says
that she thinks she's dying,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.720
and she wants to know if you would take
Eun-Sook to America with you."

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.896
And I said, "I'm 28 years old
and I live in hotels,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.736
and I'm not married."

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.976
I mean, I had fallen in love
with this girl,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.936
but you know, emotionally
I was about 12 years old.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.536
If you know of photographers,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.976
the joke is it's the finest form
of delayed adolescence ever invented.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.616
"Sorry, I have to go
on an assignment, I'll be back" --

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.056
and then you never come back.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.376
So I asked the translator
why she thought she was dying.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.296
Can I get her to a hospital?
Could I pay to get her a doctor?

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.336
And she refused any help at all.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.520
So when I got outside,
I gave the translator some money and said,

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.640
"Go back and see if you can do something."

00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:48.736
And I gave the grandmother
my business card.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.016
And I said, "If you're serious,
I will try to find a family for her."

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.456
And I immediately wrote a letter
to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.816
who had an 11-year-old son.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.296
And my best friend
had mistakenly one day said something

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.816
about wishing he had another child.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.896
So my friends Gene and Gayle
had not heard from me in about a year,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.336
and suddenly I was calling,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.616
saying "I'm in Korea
and I've met this extraordinary girl."

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.336
And I said, "The grandmother
thinks she's sick,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.856
but I think maybe we would have to
bring the grandmother over also."

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.536
And I said, "I'll pay for the ... "
I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.816
So anyway, I left.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.336
And my friends actually said
they were very interested in adopting her.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.336
And I said, "Look, I think
I'll scare the grandmother to death,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.936
if I tell her that
you're willing to adopt her.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.976
I want to go back and talk to her."
But I was off on assignment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.096
I figured I'd come back
in a couple of weeks

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.496
and talk to the grandmother.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.736
And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok
with a group of photographers

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.696
and got a telegram --
back in those days, you got telegrams --

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.136
from Time magazine
saying someone in Korea had died

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.416
and left their child in a will to me.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.976
Did I know anything about this?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.096
Because I hadn't told them
what I was doing,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.656
because I was so upset
with the story they'd run.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.056
So, I went back to Korea,
and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.296
and she was gone.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.016
And the house that
I had spent time in was empty.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.656
It was incredibly cold.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.296
No one in the village
would tell me where Eun-Sook was,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.256
because the grandmother
had always hidden her from Westerners.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.216
And they had no idea
about this request that she'd made of me.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.056
So I finally found Myung Sung,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.216
her best friend that she used to play with
after school every day.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.216
And Myung Sung, under some pressure
from me and the translator,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.616
gave us an address
on the outside of Seoul.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.256
And I went to that address
and knocked on the door,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.656
and a man answered the door.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.576
It was not a very nice area of Seoul,
there were mud streets outside of it.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.296
And I knocked on the door
and Eun-Sook answered the door,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.096
and her eyes were bloodshot,
and she seemed to be in shock.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.096
She didn't recognize me --
there was no recognition whatsoever.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.376
And this man came to the door
and kind of barked something in Korean.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.656
And I said to the translator,
"What did he say?"

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.816
And she said, "He wants
to know who you are."

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.096
And I said, "Tell him
that I am a photographer."

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.536
I started explaining who I was,
and he interrupted.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.536
And she said, "He says he knows
who you are, what do you want?"

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.016
I said, "Well, tell him that I was asked
by this little girl's grandmother

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.976
to find a family for her."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.240
And he said, "I'm her uncle,
she's fine, you can leave now."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.360
So I was --

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.376
The door was being slammed in my face,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.576
it's incredibly cold,
and I'm trying to think,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.256
"What would the hero do in a movie,
if I was writing this as a movie script?"

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.936
So I said, "It's really cold,
I've come a very long way,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.456
do you mind if I come in
for a minute? I'm freezing."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.416
So the guy reluctantly let us in
and we sat down on the floor.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.895
And as we started talking,
I saw him yell something,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.696
and Eun-Sook came
and brought us some food.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.056
And I had this whole mental picture
of -- sort of like Cinderella.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.576
I sort of had this picture
of this incredibly wonderful,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.576
bright, happy little child,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.576
who now appeared to be very withdrawn,
being enslaved by this family.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.656
And I was really appalled,
and I couldn't figure out what to do.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.976
And the more I tried talking to him,
the less friendly he was getting.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.016
So finally I said "Look," --
this is all through the translator,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.496
because, you know,
I don't speak a word of Korean --

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.816
and I said, "Look, I'm really glad
that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.256
I was very worried about her.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.936
I made a promise to her grandmother,
your mother, that I would find a family,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.576
and I'm so happy that
you're going to take care of her.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.496
But I bought an airline ticket
and I'm stuck here for a week.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.096
I'm staying in a hotel downtown.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.336
Would you like to come
and have lunch tomorrow?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.056
And you can practice your English."

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.376
Because he told me -- I was trying
to ask him questions about himself.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.496
And so I went to the hotel,
and I found two older Amerasians.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.976
A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.856
and she was a prostitute,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.816
and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.136
And I said to them,
"Look, there's a little girl

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.296
who has a tiny chance
of getting out of here

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.576
and going to America.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.936
I don't know if it's
the right decision or not,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.136
but I would like you
to come to lunch tomorrow

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.896
and tell the uncle what it's like
to walk down the street,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.496
what people say to you,
what you do for a living.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.536
I want him to understand
what happens if she stays here.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.976
And I could be wrong, I don't know,
but I wish you would come tomorrow."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.816
So, these two came to lunch
and we got thrown out of the restaurant.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.296
They were yelling at him,
it got to be really ugly.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.273
We went outside, and he was just furious.

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.336
And I knew I had totally blown this thing.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.736
Here I was again,
trying to figure out what to do.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.576
And he started yelling at me,
and I said to the translator,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.616
"Tell him to calm down,
what is he saying?"

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.056
And she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell
are you to walk into my house,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.616
some rich American
with your cameras around your neck,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.336
accusing me of enslaving my niece?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.662
This is my niece, I love her,
she's my sister's daughter.

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:36.096
Who the hell are you
to accuse me of something like this?'"

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.976
And I said, you know,
"Look, you're absolutely right.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.416
I don't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.416
All I know is, I've been
photographing a lot of these children.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.376
I'm in love with your niece,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.736
I think she's an incredibly
special child."

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.216
And I said, "Look, I will fly my friends
over here from the United States

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.896
if you want to meet them,
to see if you approve of them.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.536
I just think that --
what little I know about the situation,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.296
she has very little chance here
of having the kind of life

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.336
that you probably would like her to have."

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.856
So, everyone told me afterwards
that inviting the prospective parents over

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.656
was, again, the stupidest thing
I could have possibly done,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.016
because who's ever
good enough for your relative?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.136
But he invited me to come to a ceremony
they were having that day

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.536
for her grandmother.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.256
And they actually take
items of clothing and photographs,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.240
and they burn them as part of the ritual.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.936
And you can see how different she looks
just in three months.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.376
This was now, I think, early February.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.680
And the pictures before
were taken in September.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.136
Well, there was
an American Maryknoll priest

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.416
that I had met in the course
of doing the story,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.376
who had 75 children living in his house.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.016
He had three women helping him
take care of these kids.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.296
And so I suggested to the uncle
that we go down and meet Father Keane

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.416
to find out how
the adoption process worked.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.816
Because I wanted him to feel

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.256
like this was all being done
very much above board.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.640
So, this is on the way
down to the orphanage.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.240
This is Father Keane.
He's just a wonderful guy.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.336
He had kids from
all over Korea living there,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.360
and he would find families for these kids.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.896
This is a social worker
interviewing Eun-Sook.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.336
Now, I had always thought she was
completely untouched by all of this,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.856
because the grandmother, to me,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.456
appeared to be sort of
the village wise woman --

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.976
throughout the day, I noticed people
kept coming to visit her grandmother.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.736
And I always had this mental picture

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.456
that even though they may have been
one of the poorer families in the village,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.216
they were one of the most respected.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.816
And I always felt that the grandmother
had kind of demanded, and insisted,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.280
that the villagers treat Eun-Sook
with the same respect they treated her.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.336
Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.936
and her uncle agreed to let her stay there
until the adoption went through.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.816
He actually agreed to the adoption.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.496
And I went off on assignment
and came back a week later,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.536
and Father Keane said,
"I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.896
I said, "Oh God, now what?"

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.616
And he takes me into this room,
closes the door and says,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.776
"I have 75 children here in the orphanage,
and it's total bedlam."

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.256
There's clothes, there's kids.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.616
Three adults and 75 kids --
you can imagine.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.496
And he said, "The second day
she was here she made up a list

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.496
of all of the names
of the older kids and the younger kids.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.056
And she assigned one of the older kids
to each of the younger kids.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.656
And then she set up a work detail list
of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.816
And he said, "She's telling me
that I'm messy

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.416
and I have to clean up my room."

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.016
And he said, "I don't know who raised her,
but she's running the orphanage,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.616
and she's been here three days."

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.096
(Laughter)

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.160
This was movie day that she organized
where all the kids went to the movies.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.416
A lot of the kids who had been adopted
wrote back to the other kids,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.376
telling them what their life
was like with their new families.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.016
So it was a really big deal
when the letters showed up.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.496
This is a woman who is
now working at the orphanage,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.806
whose son had been adopted.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.976
Gene and Gayle started studying Korean

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.016
the moment they had gotten
my first letter.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.536
They really wanted to be able
to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.616
And one of the things Father Keane told me

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.656
when I came back
from one of these trips --

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.576
Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.856
which I understood was from her watching
a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.816
on the American Air Force station.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.896
This may be one
of those myth-buster things

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.096
that we'll have to
clear up here, in a minute.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.416
So, my friend Gene
flew over with his son, Tim.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.976
Gayle couldn't come.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.616
And they spent a lot of time
huddled over a dictionary.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.336
And this was Gene showing the uncle

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.480
where Atlanta was on the map,
where he lived.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.960
This is the uncle
signing the adoption papers.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.256
Now, we went out to dinner
that night to celebrate.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.896
The uncle went back to his family

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.376
and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I
went out to dinner.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.256
And Gene was showing Natasha
how to use a knife and fork,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.000
and then Natasha
was returning the utensil lessons.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.856
We went back to our hotel room,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.336
and Gene was showing Natasha
also where Atlanta was.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.336
This is the third night we were in Korea.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.416
The first night we'd gotten a room
for the kids right next to us.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.056
I'd been staying in this room
for about three months --

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.000
it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.976
The second night,
we didn't keep the kids' room,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.096
because we slept on the floor
with all the kids at the orphanage.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.856
And the third night, we came back --

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.656
we'd just gone out to dinner,
where you saw the pictures --

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.896
and we got to the front desk,
and the guy said,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.336
"There's no other free rooms
on your floor tonight,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.456
you can put the kids
five floors below you."

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.616
And Gene and I
looked at each other and said,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.016
"We don't want two 11-year-olds
five floors away."

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.176
So his son said, "I have a sleeping bag,
I'll sleep on the floor."

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.136
And I said, "I have one too."
So Tim and I slept on the floor,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.936
Natasha got one bed,
Gene got the other -- kids pass out,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.856
it's been very exciting for three days.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.376
We're lying in bed, and Gene and I
are talking about how cool we are.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.376
We said, "That was so great,
we saved this little girl's life."

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.856
We were just like,
you know, just full of ourselves.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.216
And we fall asleep --

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.816
and I've been in this room
for a couple of months now.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.696
And they always overheat
the hotels in Korea terribly,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.016
so during the day
I always left the window open.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.936
And then about midnight,
they turn the heat off in the hotel.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.256
So at 1am, the whole room would be
like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.496
I'd been doing this
every night I'd been there.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.016
So, sure enough,
it's one o'clock, room's freezing,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.736
I go to close the window
and I hear people shouting outside,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.380
and I thought, "Oh, the bars
must have just gotten out."

00:16:05.404 --> 00:16:07.816
I don't speak Korean,
but I'm hearing these voices,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.320
and I'm not hearing anger,
I'm hearing terror.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.176
So I open the window and I look out,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.936
and there's flames
coming up the side of our hotel,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.656
and the hotel's on fire.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.616
So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.416
and I say, "Don't freak out,
I think the hotel's on fire."

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.136
And now there's smoke and flames
coming by our windows --

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.416
we're on the 11th floor.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.096
So the two of us were just like,
"Oh my God, oh my God."

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.496
So we're trying to get Natasha up,
and we can't talk to her.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.816
You know what kids are like
when they've been asleep for like an hour,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.816
it's like they took five Valiums --
they're all over the place.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.056
And we can't talk to her.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.496
His son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces,
and we're trying to do up his laces.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.696
So we try to get to the door,
we run to the door, we open the door,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.776
and it's like walking
into a blast furnace.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.176
There's people screaming,
the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.016
And the whole room filled
with smoke in about two seconds.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.936
And Gene turns around and says,
"We're not going to make it."

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.176
And he closes the door, and the whole room
is now filled with smoke.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.936
We're all choking, and there's smoke

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.976
pouring through the vents,
under the doors.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.256
There's people screaming.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.896
I just remember this unbelievable --
just utter chaos.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.416
I remember sitting near the bed,
and I had two overwhelming feelings.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.736
One was absolute terror.
"Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.416
This has got to be a nightmare,
this can't be happening.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.016
Please, I just want to wake up."

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.776
And the other is unbelievable guilt.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.176
Here I've been playing God
with my friends' lives,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.016
my friends' son, with Natasha's life,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.336
and this what you get when you try
playing God, is you hurt people.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.736
I remember just being
so frightened and terrified.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.736
And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.816
"We've got to soak towels."
I said, "What?"

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.776
"We've got to soak towels.
We're going to die from the smoke."

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.705
So got towels and put them
over our faces and the kids' faces.

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:43.776
Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.536
"What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.416
I said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton."

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.298
He says, "We've got to stop the smoke.
That's all we can do."

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:52.162
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.656
So we put the room service menus
over the vents in the wall,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.736
we put blankets at the bottom of the door,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.456
we put the kids on the windowsill
to try to get some air.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.376
And there was a new building, going up,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.256
that was being built
right across the street from our hotel.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.471
And there, in the building,
were photographers,

00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:11.296
waiting for people to jump.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.416
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.496
Five people jumped and died,
other people were killed by the smoke.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.496
And there's this loud thumping on the door
after about 45 minutes in all this,

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.216
and people were shouting in Korean.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.480
And I remember --

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.616
Natasha didn't want us opening the door --

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.616
sorry, I was trying not to open the door,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.136
because we'd spent so much time
barricading the room.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.856
I didn't know who it was,
I didn't know what they wanted,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.816
and Natasha could tell
they were firemen trying to get us out.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.176
I remember a sort of a tussle at the door,
trying to get the door open.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.616
In any case, 12 hours later --
I mean, they put us in the lobby.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.256
Gene ended up using his coat,
and his fist in the coat,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.816
to break open a liquor cabinet.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.376
People were lying on the floor.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.576
It was one of just
the most horrifying nights.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.336
And then 12 hours later,
we rented a car, as we had planned to,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.336
and drove back to Natasha's village.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.496
And we kept saying, "Do you realize
we were dying in a hotel fire,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.736
like eight hours ago?"

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.496
It's so weird how life just goes on.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.936
Natasha wanted to introduce her brother
and father to all the villagers,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.296
and the day we showed up turned out
to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.536
This guy's 60 years old.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.336
So it turned into a dual celebration,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.896
because Natasha was
the first person from this village

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.496
ever to go to the United States.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.216
So, these are the greenhouse tents.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.416
This is the elders
teaching Gene their dances.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.816
We drank a lot of rice wine.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.160
We were both so drunk,
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.736
This is the last picture
before Gene and Tim headed back.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.416
The adoption people told us

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.480
it was going to take a year
for the adoption to go through.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.936
Like, what could you do for a year?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.696
So I found out the name of every official
on both the Korean and American side,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.976
and I photographed them,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.336
and told them how famous they were
going to be when this book was done.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.216
And four months later,
the adoption papers came through.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.416
This is saying goodbye
to everybody at the orphanage.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.360
This is Father Keane with Natasha
at the bus stop.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.536
Her great aunt at the airport.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.976
I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific
airlines for many years,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.016
where they gave me free passes
on all their airlines

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.336
in return for photography.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.136
It was like the ultimate perk.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.056
And the pilot, I actually knew --

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.416
because they used to let me sit
in the jump seat,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.096
to tell you how long ago this was.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.576
This is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha
actually sit in the jump seat.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.776
And the pilot, Jeff Cowley,
actually went back

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.896
and adopted one of the other kids
at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.976
This is 28 hours later in Atlanta.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.416
It's a very long flight.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.776
Just to make things even crazier,
Gayle, Natasha's new mom,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.520
was three days away
from giving birth to her own daughter.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.936
You know, if you were
writing this, you'd say,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.216
"No, we've got to write
the script differently."

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.936
This is the first night showing Natasha
her new cousins and uncles and aunts.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.016
Gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta --
they're the most social couple imaginable.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.957
So, at this point, Natasha
doesn't speak a word of English,

00:20:57.981 --> 00:21:00.181
other than what little
Father Keane taught her.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.520
This is Kylie, her sister,
who's now a doctor, on the right.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.856
This is a deal I had with Natasha,
which is that when we got to Atlanta

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.040
she could cut off my beard.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.960
She never liked it very much.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.216
She learned English in three months.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.440
She entered seventh grade
at her own age level.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.136
Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.536
This is her cooking teacher.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.376
Natasha told me a lot of the kids
thought she was stuck up,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.016
because they would talk to her
and she wouldn't answer,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.816
and they didn't realize
she didn't speak English very well.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.816
But what I noticed, again as an observer,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.320
was she was choosing
who was going to be on her team,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.016
and seemed to be very popular
very, very quickly.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.336
Now, remember the picture,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.136
how much she looked like
her grandmother, at the beginning?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.816
People were always telling Natasha
how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.080
(Laughter)

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.600
This is a tense moment
in the first football game, I think.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.400
And Kylie -- I mean, it was
almost like Kylie was her own child.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.400
She's being baptized.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.736
Now, a lot of parents, when they adopt,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.016
actually want to erase
their children's history.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.176
And Gayle and Gene
did the complete opposite.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.776
They were studying Korean;
they bought Korean clothes.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.056
Gene even did a little
tile work in the kitchen,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.976
which was that, "Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful girl

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.429
that came from the hills of Korea
to live happily ever after in Atlanta."

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:32.669
She hates this picture --
it was her first job.

00:22:32.693 --> 00:22:35.096
She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.496
with the money she made
working at Burger King.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.240
The captain of the cheerleaders.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.040
Beauty pageant.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.776
Used to do their
Christmas card every year.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.400
Gene's been restoring this car
for a million years.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.136
Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator
for them at the Olympics in Korea.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.056
Her future husband, Jeff,
was working for Canon cameras,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.040
and met Natasha at the Olympic Village.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.400
This is her first trip back to Korea.
So there's her uncle.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.200
This is her half sister.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.976
She went back to the village.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.560
That's her best friend's mother.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.136
And I always thought that was
a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.400
(Laughter)

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.216
It's just, you know, it was
just so interesting, just to watch --

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.280
this is her mother
in the background there.

00:23:31.207 --> 00:23:33.007
This is Natasha's wedding day.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.520
Gene is looking a little older.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.120
This is Sydney, who's going to be
three years old in a couple of days.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.360
And there's Evan.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.256
And Natasha, would you
just come up, for a second,

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.096
just maybe to say hello to everybody?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.640
(Applause)

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.856
Natasha's actually
never heard me tell the story.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.136
You know, we've looked
at the pictures together.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.336
Natasha: I've seen pictures
millions of times,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.200
but today was the first time I'm actually
seeing him give the whole presentation.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.896
I started crying.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.776
Rick Smolan: There's about 40 things
she's going to tell me,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.136
"That wasn't what happened."
Natasha: I'll tell you that later.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.056
RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard,
so much for letting us tell the story.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.336
Thank you, all of you.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.840
(Applause)
