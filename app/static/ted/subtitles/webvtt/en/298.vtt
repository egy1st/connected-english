00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
♫ Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else, ♫

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
♫ nobody anywhere. ♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
♫ A moment ago, there were voices and faces to look upon, ♫

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ you can't see them anywhere. ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ and no one left to say it to, anyway. ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
♫ Oh, listen to what I say. ♫

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
♫ Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth. ♫

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
♫ You don't have to be a big celebrity ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ You don't have to be a big star on MTV ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see. ♫

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
♫ I can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
♫ She can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
♫ He can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
♫ we can make a little bit of difference in this world. ♫

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ little difference, yeah. ♫

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000
♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.000
♫ Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ oh yeah. ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Applause)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Thank you so much.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
(Applause)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This is a song that came about

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because I think it's difficult to be in the world

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and not be aware of what's going on,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and the wars and so forth.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This song kind of came out of all of that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
which I still stand by,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but this has got something else in it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's called "Peace on Earth."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
♫ There is no hope. ♫

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
♫ There is no future. ♫

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
♫ There is no reconciliation ♫

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
♫ and no collective compromise. ♫

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
♫ There is no great society. ♫

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
♫ There is no universal plan. ♫

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
♫ The answer is ♫

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
♫ a balance of power, ♫

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000
♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:35.000
♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
(Trumpet sounds)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:28.000
(Trumpet sounds)

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
♫ There in the hallway, ♫

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
♫ peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
(Applause)
