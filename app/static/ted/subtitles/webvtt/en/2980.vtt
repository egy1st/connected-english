WEBVTT

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:24.257
An Arab and a Jew walk
into an Escape Room.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.472
(Laughter)

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.282
Yeah, it sounds like a joke.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.555
What do they feel?

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:32.932
Fear?

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:36.552
Negative stereotypes?

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:39.292
Mistrust? Conflict?

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.528
Probably.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.268
But, what do they have
actually in common?

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:47.648
Quite a lot.

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:52.053
They won't be able
to escape from imprisonment

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:57.886
unless they interact, cooperate
and figure together a way out.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.936
This is exactly what we do.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.210
We bring people
living in a conflict zone together,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.216
through an online gameplay,

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:12.776
putting aside fear,
negative stereotypes and mistrust,

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:19.662
and communicating, collaborating,
and even becoming friends.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:27.636
However, conflicts
are not exclusive to our region.

00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:30.891
Conflicts are everywhere.

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.412
Conflicts are awful.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:38.742
They affect the quality of life
in every society and city involved.

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:42.954
Living in a conflict zone
and being a father,

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:47.704
I have been restless, concerned
and worried for many years.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:52.674
Some of you share
the same concerns, worries,

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.674
and maybe attempts

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:59.034
to figure out ways
to bring some good to our future.

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:04.944
Many have tried different programs,
yet many have failed.

00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:08.058
You've probably experienced,
for example,

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:11.978
some Arab-Jewish dialogue programs
conducted at schools.

00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:15.883
Honestly, none of them really work,

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.819
make a change,

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.649
or create true friendships.

00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:28.217
I felt we don't have
a privilege to sit aside,

00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:29.827
none of us has.

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:34.537
And we cannot wait for politicians
to bring any good to our region.

00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:37.637
We cannot wait and we should not wait.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.884
Being a father,

00:02:40.864 --> 00:02:41.864
I learn a lot -

00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:43.627
(Laughter)

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:46.504
from my kids, my nephews, my family.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:51.924
A while ago, I had
an amazing observation.

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:55.802
I've noticed my kid,

00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:59.502
my son and my nephews,

00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:02.052
having a loud phone conversation

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.532
while playing on their iPads.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:09.330
I've realized that they were
aligning moves with relatives abroad

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.050
while playing an online
video game with them.

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:15.553
This made me wonder.

00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:20.223
Young people are passionate
about screens and video games.

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:23.958
They play, they interact, they enjoy -

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.813
sometimes they fight,

00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.393
but unlike most adults,

00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:31.385
they recover, forgive
and go back to play very fast.

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:35.601
And they are not fixed yet
with negative stereotypes

00:03:35.937 --> 00:03:37.057
or perceptions.

00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:41.541
If online video games
can bring people together,

00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:44.700
what if we utilize them

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.290
to get people to play,
interact and become friends,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.330
even in conflict zones?

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:54.173
Eureka!

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:55.936
(Laughter)

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.247
Young gamers are damn too good.

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.537
They are great problem solvers.

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:05.017
They strive to become
the best version of themselves,

00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:07.337
seeking a heroic win,

00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:11.657
to somehow and some extent
save the world while playing.

00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:17.517
If young gamers are damn too good
in solving problems in a virtual world,

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.997
are they capable of solving
real problems in the real life?

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:27.156
This led me to meet Uri and Dudi,

00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:30.856
who share the same thoughts and desires

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:37.596
to utilize the language
young people love, want and deserve:

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:39.946
online video games!

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:44.666
Together, we founded
Games For Peace.

00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:49.117
Now, the idea of utilizing
online video games

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.858
to address some of the urgent issues

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.131
wasn't really new.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.669
In fact, many have tried
to pursue this idea

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.039
by developing some designated games

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.019
aiming at dialogue, conflict resolution
and peace promotion.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.416
Maybe you've heard of such games.

00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:10.314
These games could be great
as an experiment,

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:16.634
but none of them is actually
famous, scalable, or even popular.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.660
Instead of developing
designated games,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.240
we are exploiting the great appeal
of mass popular online video games.

00:05:27.906 --> 00:05:29.076
Minecraft.

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.535
Minecraft is a great environment,

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:39.105
a game where communication,
collaboration and creativity are prized.

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:44.865
It's popular, and young people
are addicted to it.

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:51.760
Did you know that over 40 million gamers
play Minecraft every month?

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:57.279
Minecraft has today
over 100 million users around the world.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.789
If they all go live to play together,

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.269
that would make them
one of the largest countries in the world.

00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:10.004
Together with our developers,

00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:13.509
we took Minecraft
and changed its settings

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.889
to meet our needs.

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:18.584
We created a new look and feel,

00:06:18.584 --> 00:06:19.909
a new gameplay,

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.509
and gave players more features
without imposing any agenda.

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.183
Remember the Escape Room?

00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:31.843
This is how our gameplay begins.

00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:38.305
Our gameplay requires players
to talk, to collaborate,

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:41.336
to align moves, to become allies.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.290
Can you imagine young people
from all across the Middle East

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.730
coming to play Minecraft together?

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.030
We did it!

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:59.616
It was very exciting
to see young gamers

00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:05.122
from Israel, Palestine, Jordan,
Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Iran -

00:07:05.122 --> 00:07:06.123
yes, Iran -

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.053
coming to play Minecraft together.

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:16.331
Teenagers came to play,
came to do, what they like most,

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.871
to play games they love.

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:22.071
And they came back to play
again and again,

00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:24.991
and inspired more gamers to join.

00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:29.054
For them, it's Minecraft.

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:34.964
For us, it's a radical new way
of bridging the gaps

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:38.094
between different sectors
in a conflict zone.

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:42.554
Now, you're probably wondering,

00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:45.640
if each one comes
from a different country,

00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:48.494
how did they manage to communicate?

00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:53.516
Well, technology is not an issue.

00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:57.816
We've managed to embed
an instant translation chat engine

00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.346
into our game,

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:03.786
so everyone enjoys playing
without any lingual barriers.

00:08:06.012 --> 00:08:10.912
Amazingly, social media was great
in spreading our message.

00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:16.372
Our program was embraced
by young gamers in Georgia and Abkhazia.

00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:20.169
It was also conducted
between Spanish and Basque gamers

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:21.786
at the Basque Museum.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.426
Look at them.

00:08:23.426 --> 00:08:25.698
Isn't it great to enjoy a game you love

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:31.896
and, at the same time, break down
historical walls of hate and mistrust,

00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:34.440
giving peace a real chance?

00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:40.336
Today, our program
is running at schools in Israel,

00:08:40.693 --> 00:08:45.544
bringing young Arabs and Jews
to play Minecraft together,

00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:49.584
and to get to know each other better.

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:53.326
They play online,

00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:59.515
and, after several sessions,
they meet offline, face to face,

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:01.429
and they enjoy it a lot.

00:09:01.429 --> 00:09:05.211
(Applause)

00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.101
The program is so appealing

00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:15.321
the teachers are asking us to participate
and have their own gameplay.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.214
(Laughter)

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:23.059
We're speaking of a real measurable change

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:25.026
in real time and in the real world.

00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:29.076
We see more positive
thoughts of the others,

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:33.698
an increase in the readiness
to engage with the others.

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.381
The potential for good is incredible.

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:45.126
So, if you want
a more comfortable present

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:47.246
and a better future -

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:49.560
I bet you all want a better future -

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.350
we need to start investing
in young people,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.900
learn from them, listen to them,
interact with them.

00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:00.885
Young generations can teach us - us -

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:03.739
how to break down barriers,

00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:05.699
how to accept the others around,

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:07.259
how to build peace.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:12.187
What will happen
if we trap together

00:10:12.407 --> 00:10:19.237
an American, a North Korean,
an Afghani and a Russian,

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:22.363
all in one Escape Room?

00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:27.113
Can online games make a difference?

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:30.842
Let's see! Let's play!

00:10:30.842 --> 00:10:32.262
(Applause)

00:10:33.682 --> 00:10:34.792
Thank you.

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:36.352
(Applause)
