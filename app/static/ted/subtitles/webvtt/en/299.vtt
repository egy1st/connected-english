00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I don't speak English.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then went to university in Kisangani.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But what I've been doing --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And my father was a soldier,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
bring it in the main city to get access to the market.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But finally, I got myself involved.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I wanted to do it, because -- I believed -- to continue my studies.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, I did it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And for three to four years, I went to university.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I didn't succeed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
My family's poor, my area don't have better health care.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I want to be a doctor to serve them."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I say, "Oh, no, I continue."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
doing botany and wildlife conservation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
with some animals and also plants.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the training center there was built

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
around the scientific Congolese staff

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and some American scientists also.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I think that is the largest number of elephants

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
we have right now in protected areas in Congo.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It has also chimpanzees.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because of this beautiful creature.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That is a forest giraffe.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I think you guys know it quite well.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Here we have savanna giraffes,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but through evolution we have this forest giraffe

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that lives only in Congo.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It has also some beautiful primates.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And it has the Ituri Forest itself --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
about 1,300 species of plants, so far known.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
but I started working with them as a student in 1991.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
because I accomplished with honor.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But I didn't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And the work we have been doing

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So they started fleeing from the east to the west.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and coming like this.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
On their way, they looted everything.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Torture, wars -- oh, my God, you can't believe.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Every person was looking his way -- where to go, we don't know.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And it was for us, the young, the first time really

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we hear the language of war, of guns.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because they have power.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Who have been doing that?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Young children. Child soldiers.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But I was from the west, working in the east.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And when they came, they looted everything.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I was from the same area to him.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I stayed after they looted everything.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We have been doing research on botany,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We cut, we dry and we packed them,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
we mounted them on a folder.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
for medicine, for whatever, and for science,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I've been working with him about 10 years.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
They came to told me, I have to save him.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that we care for tuberculosis.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And fortunately, I saved his life.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And that was the language of the war.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And what of important things --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I think all of you here have a cell phone.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
That mineral has killed a lot:

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
five millions of Congolese have gone because of this

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that they use it to make cell phones

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and good, big business of the war.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And some of equipment went with them,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
on the top of the canopy, to save it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
on the canopy.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And with the material that's left --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I packed it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to try to save that 4,000 material,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And after that, we succeeded.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
so that we continue our studies.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The second war came while we didn't expect it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
when it started, I think.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, it was so bad.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We heard that now from the east again the war started,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and it's going fast.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and competing for natural resources.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And there was no way to work.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
They destroy everything.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Poaching -- oh, no way.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
What's the regulation of the reserve

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and what is the regulation of the parks?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And they can't do what they are doing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So we went to meet them.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That is Coltan extraction, gold mining.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So, we started talking with them,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
convincing them that we are in a protected area.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
There are regulations

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But they said, "You guys,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and your animals you are protecting are most important.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We don't think so.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We have to do it, because to let our movement advance."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We started talking with them and I was negotiating.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and the villages of about 1,500 people.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And we continued.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But I was doing that, negotiating with them.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Sometimes we are having meeting

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Sometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
to supply them with ammunition and so on.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
what comes from where, and where, and where.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And every time, daily, after we have meeting,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
what compromise we have, whatever,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I go, I write a short email, send it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I don't know how many people I had on my address.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and what they are planning to do.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Something might be going on.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And one day, we went for a meeting.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
(Applause)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Sorry.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
One day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
He had the same iridium cell phone like me.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I said, "I have never seen it.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
(Laughter)

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I don't know."

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And I had mine on my pocket.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
They didn't -- they was not looking on me.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So I was scared.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And I was sending news, doing whatever,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
reporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
what have been going.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Because there was no way --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
whatever they do, it's known the same time.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
we succeeded: we had the first Okapi.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This is not local population, this is rebels.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They are now happy sending the news

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that they have protected the Okapi with the war,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
because we sent the news that they are killing

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and poaching everywhere.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
where the zoo, where Okapi was born.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And I was mad.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I succeeded.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
we have to rebuild.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I started this with 70 dollars,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and start fundraising money to where I've been going.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I had opportunity to go all over,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
where herbarium for my African material is.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And they supported me a bit, and I built this.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Now, it's doing work to train young Congolese.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And also, what one of the speciality we are doing,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and we are tracking them.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We have now data of about 15 years,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And that is -- I think it's difficult for me.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I don't know where to start, where to finish it.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
When I was thinking to come here,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Where are you people?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Now we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I think we see the war like a game --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
like soccer, football.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
see what is going in Darfur.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Now we say, oh, my God.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
See what the wars in Rwanda.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
That's because of the language of guns.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I don't think that someone may blame Google,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
because it's doing the right things,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
to connect between them.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
But it's serving millions for the best.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
But what is doing with gun industries?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Thank you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
(Applause)

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Just wait over there.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It's an amazing story.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
How can we help you?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Corneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I think that now I feel nervous.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I did it myself.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
If I know when I was young,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I would not have done it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
but there are few who are going to school.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
What you can assist us, it's by building capacities.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
How many have got opportunity like me

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
to go to U.S., do a master's?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And they can't go even to university.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
They can't even attain the bachelor's degree.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Building capacities for the young generation

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
is going to make a better generation

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and a better future tomorrow for Africa.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
CA: Thank you, thank you.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Applause)
