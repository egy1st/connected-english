00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A public, Dewey long ago observed,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is constituted through discussion and debate.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to debate and discussion.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of one of the critical issues of our time,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for the project of state building.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To put the assumptions very clearly:

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and so has democracy.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If we looked in the world of 1945

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
they were the rare exception, not the norm.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The question now, however,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is both about which form of capitalism

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and which type of democratic participation.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But we must acknowledge

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that this moment has brought about

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a rare consensus of assumptions.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And that provides the ground

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
for a type of action,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because consensus of each moment

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
allows us to act.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And it is necessary, no matter how fragile

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or how provisional our consensus,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to be able to move forward.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But the majority of the world

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
neither benefits from capitalism

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
nor from democratic systems.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Most of the globe

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
experiences the state as repressive,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
as an organization that is concerned

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
about denial of rights,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
about denial of justice,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
rather than provision of it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And in terms of experience of capitalism,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
there are two aspects

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that the rest of the globe experiences.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
First, extractive industry.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
timber,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that is cut right from under the poorest.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Second is technical assistance.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And technical assistance might shock you,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but it's the worst form

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of -- today -- of the ugly face

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of the developed world to the developing countries.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Tens of billions of dollars

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are supposedly spent on building capacity

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
who are incapable

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of thinking creatively,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
or organically.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Next assumption --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and of course the events of July 7,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
have reminded us

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we do not live in three different worlds.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We live in one world.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But that's easily said.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But we are not dealing with the implications

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of the one world that we are living in.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And that is that if we want to have one world,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
this one world cannot be based

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
on huge pockets of exclusion,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and then inclusion for some.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We must now finally come

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to think about the premises

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of a truly global world,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in relationship to the regime of rights

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and responsibilities and accountabilities

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that are truly global in scope.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Otherwise we will be missing

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
this open moment in history,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
where we have a consensus

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
on both the form of politics

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and the form of economics.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What is one of these organizations to pick?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We have three critical terms:

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
economy,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
civil society

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the state.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I will not deal with those first two, except to say

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that uncritical transfer of assumptions,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
from one context to another,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
can only make for disaster.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Economics

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
taught in most of the elite universities

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
are practically useless in my context.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
My country is dominated

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
by drug economy and a mafia.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Textbook economics does not work in my context,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and I have very few recommendations from anybody

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
as to how to put together a legal economy.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The poverty of our knowledge

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
must become the first basis

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of moving forward,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and not imposition of the framework

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that works on the basis of mathematical modeling,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for which I have enormous respect.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Second,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
instead of debating endlessly

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
about what is the structure of the state,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
why don't we simplify

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and say, what are a series of functions

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that the state in the 21st century must perform?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
we hope to share that much widely with --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and third is that we could actually construct an index

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to measure comparatively

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
how well these functions that we would agree on

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
are being performed in different places.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So what are these functions?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We propose 10.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
administrative control, management of public finances,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
provision of infrastructure,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
through regulation, creation of the market,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
international agreements, including public borrowing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and then, most importantly, rule of law.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I won't elaborate.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
This is a feasible goal,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
basically because, contrary to widespread assumption,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I would argue that we know how to do this.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Who would have imagined that Germany

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
would be either united or democratic today,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and engaged in planning.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And there are lots of other examples.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we have to rethink the notion of capital.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The least important form of capital, in this project,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is financial capital -- money.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's just cash.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Because it lacks the institutional,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
organizational, managerial forms

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to turn it into capital.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And what is required

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is a combination of physical capital,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
institutional capital, human capital --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and security, of course, is critical,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but so is information.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now, the issue that should concern us here --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and that's the challenge

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that I would like to pose to this group --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is again, it takes 16 years

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
in your countries

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to produce somebody with a B.S. degree.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It takes 20 years

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to produce somebody with a Ph.D.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The first challenge is to rethink,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
fundamentally,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the issue of the time.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Do we need to repeat

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the modalities that we have inherited?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
What is it that we need to do fundamentally

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to re-engage in a project,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that capital formation is rapid?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The absolute majority of the world's population

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
are below 20,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and they are growing larger and faster.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They need different ways

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of being approached,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
different ways of being enfranchised,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
different ways of being skilled.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And that's the first thing.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Second is, you're problem solvers,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
but you're not engaging your global responsibility.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You've stayed away

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
from the problems of corruption.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You only want clean environments in which to function.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But if you don't think through the problems of corruption,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
who will?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You stay away from design for development.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You're great designers,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but your designs are selfish.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It's for your own immediate use.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The world in which I operate

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
operates with designs

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
regarding roads, or dams,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
or provision of electricity

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that have not been revisited in 60 years.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
This is not right. It requires thinking.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But, particularly, what we need

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
more than anything else from this group

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
is your imagination

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to be brought to bear on problems

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
the way a meme is supposed to work.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Thomas Kuhn's work --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
it's in the intersection of ideas

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
that new developments --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
true breakthroughs -- occur.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And I hope that this group

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
would be able to deal with the issue of state and development

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
through this means.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Thank you.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Applause)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
you were the finance minister of Afghanistan,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
a country right at the middle

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
of much of the world's agenda.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Is the country gonna make it?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
lack of your engagement.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
(Laughter)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
No. But seriously,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
the issue of Afghanistan

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
first has to be seen as,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Today the world of globalization

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is on speed.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Time has been compressed.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And space does not exist for most people.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But in my world --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
space had expanded.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I rode -- traveled --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
travel between two cities that used to take three hours

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
now took 12.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So the first is when the scale is that,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
we need to recognize

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that just the simple things that are infrastructure --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
In our world.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Any meaningful sort of thing.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But the modality of attention,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Second is,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
when a country has been subjected

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
we had the Red Army

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
for 10 continuous years,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
110,000 strong,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
literally terrorizing.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The sky:

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
every Afghan

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
sees the sky as a source of fear.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We were bombed

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
practically out of existence.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
from all sides.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Egyptian intelligence service

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to train thousands of people

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in resistance and urban terrorism.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
How to turn a bicycle

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
into an instrument of terror.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And the Russians, equally.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So, when violence erupts

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in a country like Afghanistan,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
it's because of that legacy.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
But we have to understand

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that we've been incredibly lucky.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
standing in front of you, speaking.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
When I joined as finance minister,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I thought that the chances of my living more than three years

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
would not be more than five percent.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Those were the risks. They were worth it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I think we can make it,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and the reason we can make it

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
is because of the people.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
86 percent of the women,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
listen to at least three radio stations a day.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
In terms of their discourse,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I think that I would dare say,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
they're much more sophisticated

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
than rural Americans with college degrees

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and the bulk of Europeans --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
because the world matters to them.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And what is their predominant concern?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Abandonment.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Afghans have become deeply internationalist.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
You know, when I went back in December of 2001,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
because I'd lived as a nationalist.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
separate.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And everybody was telling me it was a different world.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You know, they engage.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
They see engagement, global engagement,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Clare Lockhart is here,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
so I'll recite a discussion she had

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And that woman said she didn't care

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
whether she had food on her table.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
where her children could really have a different life.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That gives me hope.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
CA: How is Afghanistan

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
going to provide alternative income

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to the many people

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
who are making their living off the drugs trade?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
AG: Certainly. Well, the first is,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
instead of sending a billion dollars

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
on drug eradication

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and paying it to a couple of security companies,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
they should give this hundred billion dollars

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to 50

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
of the most critically innovative companies in the world

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
to ask them to create one million jobs.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The key to the drug eradication is jobs.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Look, there's a very little known fact:

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
don't produce drugs.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Second, textile.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Trade is the key, not aid.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
The U.S. and Europe

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
should give us a zero percent tariff.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
The textile industry is incredibly mobile.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
we could probably attract

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
four to six billion dollars

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
quite easily in the textile sector,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
if there was zero tariffs --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
would create the type of job.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Cotton does not compete with opium;

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
a t-shirt does.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And we need to understand, it's the value chain.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of hearing about microcredit.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It is important,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is global access.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that are only for foreigners --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and the same bloody shirt

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
embroidered time and again.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
What we want is a partnership

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
with the Italian design firms.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
With the Put Out system?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So I think economically,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
the critical issue really is to now think through.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You know, the aid system is broken.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
The aid system does not have the knowledge,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the vision, the ability.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Yeah, to be exact, you know,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I managed to persuade the world that

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
they had to give my country 27.5 billion.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
They didn't want to give us the money.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
CA: And it still didn't work?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It's that a dollar of private investment,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
in my judgment,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
in terms of the dynamic that it generates.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
it could be 20 cents;

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
or it could be four dollars.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
It depends on what form it comes,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
entrepreneurs of the developed countries,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
not to generate growth in the poor countries.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And this is, again, one of those assumptions --

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
the way car seats are an assumption

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
that we've inherited in governments, and doors.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
You would think that the US government

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
would not think that American firms needed subsidizing

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
to function in developing countries, provide advice,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
but they do.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
There's an entire weight of history

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
vis-a-vis aid

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
that now needs to be reexamined.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
If the goal is to build states

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that can credibly take care of themselves --

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and I'm putting that proposition equally;

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts --

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
aid must end

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
in each country in a definable period.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And every year there must be progress

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
on mobilization of domestic revenue

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
and generation of the economy.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Unless that kind of compact is entered into,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
you will not be able to sustain the consensus.
