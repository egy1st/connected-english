00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we think is going to change the way that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That technology is simulating humans.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's simulated humans with a simulated body

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a simulated nervous system to control that body.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, before I talk more about that technology,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at the moment in computer games.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We already saw that briefly yesterday.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's one of the most successful games of all time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They pretty much look the same.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And you can see he looks always the same.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The reason for that is that these characters

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are actually not real characters.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They are a graphical visualization of a character.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what's going to happen in the actual game,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and then has to animate that particular sequence.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then these particular animations are just played back

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
at appropriate times in the computer game.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All you have is animations that are played back

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
at more or less the appropriate times.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
what you actually put into it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There's no real emergence there.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, the only way to get around that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is to actually simulate the human body

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to show what the difference is --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and that's because he has a physical body,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and because he has the motor skills to control that body.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's a very trivial thing.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Torsten Reil: That's it, yes.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, that's what we're trying to simulate --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and we tried to start very simply.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that actually makes it work.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that controls walking in humans.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's called the central pattern generator.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is to teach that network how to walk.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We heard about those already yesterday,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But, just briefly, the concept is that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
you create a large number of different individuals --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
neural networks, in this case --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all of which are random at the beginning.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of that two-legged creature here --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and hope that it does something interesting.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Most of them won't move at all,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but some of them might make a tiny step.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Those are then selected by the algorithm,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And you repeat that process over and over again,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
until you have something that walks --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
in this case, in a straight line, like this.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So that was the idea behind this.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
like I've just demonstrated,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and this is what I got instead.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So, it was back to the drawing board for us.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We did get it to work eventually,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
after tweaking a bit here and there.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
At the beginning, it can't walk at all,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but it will get better and better over time.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
(Laughter)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
still not quite there.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That was the real breakthrough for us.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It was, academically, quite a challenging project,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that we could try and do other things as well with this approach --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
actually simulating the body

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
for things like computer games or online worlds.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
What you see here is the character standing there,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
which is what I'm doing now, here,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it will fall over it in a completely different way.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Laughter)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Okay. That's the video. Thanks.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because this is not something you get at the moment

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in any interactive or any virtual worlds.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
What we really wanted was a full human body.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So we started the company.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was to create the human body, basically.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and tried to make it as realistic as possible.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What you see here on the screen right now

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
is a very simple visualization of that body.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
so you can concentrate on the movement.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Nothing really interesting, basically.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's going to stick out its hands.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So that's what you see here.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Now, it gets really interesting

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So here, we've got the same character.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I'm going to push it a bit harder now,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
harder than I just pushed Chris.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
What you see is it takes steps backwards,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it tries to counter-balance,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I'll show you this again.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And then, finally hits the floor.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Now, this becomes really exciting

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
That's something that you cannot do right now.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
First, starting with a push from the right.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
so you can see that the reaction is different.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Again, a push, now this time from the front.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And you see it falls differently.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And now from the left --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and it falls differently.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
That was really exciting for us to see that.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
That was the first time we've seen that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
This is the first time the public sees this as well,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
because we have been in stealth mode.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I haven't shown this to anybody yet.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Now, just a fun thing:

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
what happens if you put that character --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
(Laughter)

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And this is what happens.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Applause)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's nothing we had to do about this.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We just took this character that I just talked about,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Now, when we went to film studios and games developers

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and showed them that technology, we got a very good response.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
That's what people want. That's what we're giving them.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
(Laughter)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
You can see, it's always reacting.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
feels the force and tries to protect its head.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You feel kind of sorry for that thing,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and we've seen it so many times now that

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
we don't really care any more.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
(Laughter)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Now, here's another one.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
a strong force applied to the character,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and have the character react to it in midair.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So that you don't have a character that looks limp,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that looks kind of alive in midair as well.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So this character is going to be hit by a force,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
it's going to realize it's in the air,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and it's going to try and, well,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
That's one angle; here's another angle.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We now think that the realism we're achieving with this

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
is good enough to be used in films.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This is something I just got last night

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from an animation studio in London, who are using our software

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and experimenting with it right now.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
but in a slightly better rendered version.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So if you look at the character carefully,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
you see there are lots of body movements going on,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
none of which you have to animate like in the old days.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Animators had to actually animate them.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
This is all happening automatically in the simulation.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This is a slightly different angle,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and again a slow motion version of this.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
At the moment, doing something like this by hand

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
would take you probably a couple of days.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is another behavior they requested.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
In this case, the character's hands

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
are fixed to a particular point in space,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And it looks organic. It looks realistic.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You feel kind of sorry for the guy.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
if you render that a bit more realistically.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And this is all a physical simulation of the body,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
to create a slightly more complex stunt scene,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Got a very short clip here.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Yes, you can just about see it here.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
"Can we do that ourselves as well?"

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Can we use the physical simulation of the character,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
use artificial intelligence,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
put that artificial intelligence into the character,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and then skydive afterwards,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
pretty much, to create the simulation.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And that's what it looks like, here.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
just to see what we'd get out of it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But what we found over the past few months

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
is incredibly powerful.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
There's so many things we can do with this right now.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
for some major productions.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The second thing is video games.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that have real bodies that really react.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Probably starting with sports games,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
which are going to become much more interactive.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But I particularly am really excited

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
about using this technology in online worlds,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The degree of interactivity you're going to get

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We've been approached by several simulation companies,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
to predict the outcome of operations on these children.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
As you probably know,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
if you try and correct the gait.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
is what people think right now, is the outcome.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and the surgeon can then work on that simulation

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and try out different ways to improve that gait,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
before he actually commits to an actual surgery.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
That's one project we're particularly excited about,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and that's going to start next month.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Just finally, this is only just the beginning.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We can only do several behaviors right now.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Right now, we don't have that

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
We do have one unintentional dancer actually,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
the last thing I'm going to show you.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
That's what we thought was going to come out of this.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
But this is what emerged out of it, in the end.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Music)

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So, this was not something we actually put in there.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
He just started to create that dance himself.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And what you see after a while --

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And I think -- there you go.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
(Laughter)

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So it's just --

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
(Applause)

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Thanks.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
so thanks very much for your time.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Thanks.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
(Applause)

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
CA: Incredible. That was really incredible.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
TR: Thanks.
