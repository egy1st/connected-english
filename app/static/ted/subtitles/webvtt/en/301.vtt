00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I see my life as a series of experiments.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to live my life for me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, they answered my emails.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They answered my phone.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It was the best month of my life,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was a wonderful experience.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
about radical honesty.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And this is a movement where --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
who says that you should never, ever lie,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
should come out of your mouth.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, I decided I would try this for a month.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This was the worst month of my life.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I do not recommend this at all.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
To give you a sense of the experience,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, that was hard.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,"

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I love that one,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because that was an experiment about how much information

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
one human brain could absorb.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You can just Google it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, I wasted some time there.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I love those experiments,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but I think that the most profound

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and life-changing experiment that I've done

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"The Year of Living Biblically."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And I undertook this for two reasons.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, not very.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But I've become increasingly interested in religion.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I do think it's the defining issue of our time,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
or one of the main ones.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The second reason I undertook this is because

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
religious fundamentalism, and people who say

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and take everything in the Bible literally,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
without picking and choosing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I had Christian bibles.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I had Jewish bibles.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Then I went down and I read several versions,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and I wrote down every single law that I could find.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So I wanted to follow those.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And actually, I take my projects very seriously,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because I had twins during my year,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
so I definitely take my projects seriously.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
There is the law in Leviticus,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I didn't know where my corners were,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so I decided to let the whole thing grow,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and this is what I looked like by the end.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So, certainly the challenge was there.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You only know if you try it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
then her hand shall be cut off.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, I wanted to follow that rule.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
That one I followed by default,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
looking like she had a strong grip.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Laughter)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I will say it was an amazing year

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You know, I could spend a year not killing,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because I couldn't believe how much

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
my behavior changed my thoughts.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This was one of the huge lessons of the year,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
is that I almost pretended to be a better person,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and I became a little bit of a better person.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you visit sick people in the hospital,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and you will become more compassionate.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
You donate money to a cause,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and you become emotionally involved in that cause.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, it really was cognitive psychology --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
very primitive cognitive psychology.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which, as we know, is actually true.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
was the rules that will get you into a little trouble

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in twenty-first-century America.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Laughter)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But it's a big part of the Bible,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
so I figured I had to address it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, I was able to stone one adulterer.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
so sandals and sort of a white robe,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And this man came up to me and he said,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
"Why are you dressed like that?"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And I explained my project,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I said, "Well, that would be great!"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
(Laughter)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that I had been carrying around for weeks,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but he grabbed them out of my hand.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
He grabbed them out of my hand

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and yet so incredibly wise in others?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
How should we view the Bible?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Should we view it, you know, as original intent,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
How was the Bible written?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And actually, since this is a tech crowd,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
over hundreds of years.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And it's sort of evolved.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So I thought I would end by telling you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that I learned from my year.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This became very, very clear, early on.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
during certain times of the month, and more than that,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And my wife thought this was very offensive,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so she sat in every seat in our apartment,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I had to spend much of the year standing

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
until I bought my own seat and carried it around.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, you know, I met with creationists.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I went to the creationists' museum.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And these are the ultimate literalists.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It's just that their faith is so strong

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
in this literal interpretation of the Bible

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that they distort all the data to fit their model.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They really did a fantastic job.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
If you're ever in Kentucky,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
there's, you can see a movie of the flood,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and they have sprinklers in the ceiling

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
they did a great job.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
(Laughter)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and I started to change my perspective.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that go right every day, that I didn't even notice,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
on the three or four that went wrong.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
is to just remember when I came over here,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It's a remarkable thing.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Third, that thou shall have reverence.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
This one was unexpected because I started the year

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
as an agnostic, and by the end of the year,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And I'm trying to start it as a movement.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So, if anyone wants to join,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and that our rituals can be sacred.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The Sabbath can be sacred.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
because I am a workaholic, so having this one day

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Thou shall not stereotype.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This one happened because

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I spent a lot of time with various religious communities

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
throughout America because I wanted it to be more

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
than about my journey.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I wanted it to be about religion in America.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I'm very proud because

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I think I'm the only person in America

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(Laughter)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
he's like, "I gotta go."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
(Laughter)

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Oh, thank you very much.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Thank you. Bless you, bless you.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
But it was interesting

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
evangelical Christianity, and I found that

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
it's such a wide and varied movement

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and they focus on the red words in the Bible,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
which are the ones that Jesus spoke.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
They have a pamphlet that says,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
helping poor people.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So, this was very inspiring to me.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
with much of what they say.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
This one was very unexpected because, you know,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I grew up with the scientific worldview,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and I was shocked learning how much of my life

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
is governed by irrational forces.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And the thing is, if they're not harmful,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
they're not to be completely dismissed.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And they said, "We don't know,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
but it's just rituals that give us meaning."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And I would say, "But that's crazy."

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And they would say, "Well, what about you?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
blowing out the fire on top of a cake

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
but that guy's crazy?'"

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So the key is to choose the right rituals,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
are not to be dismissed.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And this one I learned because

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I tried to follow everything in the Bible.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And I failed miserably.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Because you can't.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is going to be picking and choosing.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
You're just picking and choosing."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I've had some great meals at cafeterias.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
or intolerance, or violence,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
which are very much in the Bible as well.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So if we are to find any meaning in this book,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
There's me reading the Bible.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
That's how I hailed taxicabs.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
(Laughter)

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Seriously, and it worked. And yes,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that was actually a rented sheep,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
