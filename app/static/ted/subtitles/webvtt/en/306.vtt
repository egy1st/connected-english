00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How will we be remembered in 200 years?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It happened 225 years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it was a very, very severe winter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What they remember is, of course, the great triumph,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's the child that's remembered.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And that's what we're going through at this time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What I'm saying is that we should follow the model

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that has been so successful with the electronic industry,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
when kids could come home and play with them,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There's a huge --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Applause)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
-- there's a huge community of people in the world

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
people who handle biology with their hands,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and that will be an enormous positive step

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to acceptance of biotechnology.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That will blow away a lot of the opposition.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
When people have this technology in their hands,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
grow your dog, grow your own cat.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Laughter)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Applause)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Just buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
becomes part of the human condition,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So, let's leave that aside.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I want to talk about something quite different,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which is what I know about, and that is astronomy.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
or whatever the time remains.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The important fact is, that most of the real estate

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you look at the solar system, as we know it today,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but not very large. And it's not very promising for life,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's not only cold, but very dry.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There stand some interesting places a little further out:

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
where we see a very level ice surface,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to go down through the ice,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
find out who is swimming around in the ocean,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's something we don't yet know how to do.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Go out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in the cold of the outer solar system,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but they are biologically very interesting indeed,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
which are just the right ones for developing life.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So if life could be established out there,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
everything that's needed.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, what I'm proposing

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And that's what I'm going to talk about.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
just as it did on the Earth.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
it could also have moved out onto the surface.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
There wouldn't have been any air there -- it's a vacuum.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It is out in the cold, but it still could have come.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
What would they need in order to grow on the surface?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
from losing water through the skin.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But better -- what is more important

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is 25 times fainter than it is here,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Otherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
which is certainly not favorable for developing life,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
at least of the kind we know.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But if they just simply could grow, like leaves,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
then they could keep warm on the surface.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and have roots going down into the ocean;

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
life then could flourish much more.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that there's life on the surface of Europa.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
None of these things is likely, but my,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
my philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
turning out to be there. And I mean,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
They said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
so it certainly will not be detectable.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So there's no point in looking."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
by about 20 years.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
which was after about 20 years,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
just because we haven't taken the trouble to look.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
There is something called pit lamping.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
That's the phrase which I learned from my son George,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
who is there in the audience.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You take -- that's a Canadian expression.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
If you happen to want to hunt animals at night,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
you take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You strap it onto your forehead, so you can see

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You see the red glow in their eyes,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
which is the reflection of the flashlight.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you shoot the animals and take them home.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And of course, that spoils the game

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So, the farmers go out at night

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
with heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
(Laughter)

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So I have proposed to apply the same trick

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
to looking for life in the universe.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in order to keep themselves warm.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And then, when you shine sunlight at them,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
the sunlight will be reflected back,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
just as it is in the eyes of an animal.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
as you go further away,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
shines out even more in contrast against the dark background.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So as you go further away from the Sun,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
this becomes more and more powerful.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But I hope that we shall look, and with any --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
we probably won't find anything,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
it will transform our view of life altogether.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
We're having great difficulties at the moment

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Especially if you breathe air,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
-- you're dead --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
(Laughter)

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
-- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and you get knocked off the surface by a collision,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
then it doesn't change anything all that much.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And then if you run into another object, you can stay there

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
so there'll be a huge advantage to the species

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
which is able to jump from one place to another

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
for spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I call these creatures sunflowers.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
They look like, maybe like sunflowers.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and they will be able to spread out in space,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
because gravity on these objects is weak.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Laughter)

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Laughter) --

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
That would be a fun thing to do.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
(Laughter)

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
In the long run, of course,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
it would also make it possible for us to move out there.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
What's going to happen in the end,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
it's not going to be just humans colonizing space,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
it's going to be life moving out from the Earth,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
than it is today.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
So again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Thank you.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:48.000
(Applause)
