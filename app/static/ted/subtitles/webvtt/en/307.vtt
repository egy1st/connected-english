00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.528
I and my colleagues Art Aron
and Lucy Brown and others,

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:09.109
have put 37 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.006
17 who were happily in love,
15 who had just been dumped,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.166
and we're just starting
our third experiment:

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.696
studying people who report
that they're still in love

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.976
after 10 to 25 years of marriage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.976
So, this is the short story
of that research.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.322
In the jungles of Guatemala,
in Tikal, stands a temple.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:34.091
It was built by the grandest Sun King,
of the grandest city-state,

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.970
of the grandest civilization
of the Americas, the Mayas.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.085
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.395
He stood over six feet tall.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.794
He lived into his 80s,

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:49.749
and he was buried beneath
this monument in 720 AD.

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:54.234
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim
that he was deeply in love with his wife.

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:57.658
So, he built a temple
in her honor, facing his.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.087
And every spring and autumn,
exactly at the equinox,

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.546
the sun rises behind his temple,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.606
and perfectly bathes her temple
with his shadow.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.381
And as the sun sets
behind her temple in the afternoon,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:17.044
it perfectly bathes
his temple with her shadow.

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:23.524
After 1,300 years, these two lovers
still touch and kiss from their tomb.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.769
Around the world, people love.

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:29.537
They sing for love, they dance for love,

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:32.569
they compose poems and stories about love.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.168
They tell myths and legends about love.

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:40.693
They pine for love, they live for love,
they kill for love, and they die for love.

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:45.152
As Walt Whitman once said,
"O I would stake all for you."

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:49.976
Anthropologists have found evidence
of romantic love in 170 societies.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.552
They've never found a society
that did not have it.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:56.816
But love isn't always a happy experience.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.739
In one study of college students,
they asked a lot of questions about love,

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:03.702
but the two that stood out
to me the most were:

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:07.894
"Have you ever been rejected
by somebody who you really loved?"

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:09.773
And the second question was:

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:13.311
"Have you ever dumped somebody
who really loved you?"

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:18.403
And almost 95 percent of both men
and women said yes to both.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.575
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.

00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:25.783
So, before I start telling you
about the brain,

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:27.267
I want to read for you

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.976
what I think is the most powerful
love poem on Earth.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.817
There's other love poems that are,
of course, just as good,

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.035
but I don't think this one
can be surpassed.

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:40.124
It was told by an anonymous
Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:43.066
to a missionary in 1896.

00:02:43.637 --> 00:02:44.863
And here it is.

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:47.619
I've never had the opportunity
to say it before.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:52.048
"Fire runs through my body
with the pain of loving you.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:56.616
Pain runs through my body
with the fires of my love for you.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.483
Pain like a boil about to burst
with my love for you,

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:03.598
consumed by fire with my love for you.

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.728
I remember what you said to me.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.837
I am thinking of your love for me.

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:10.186
I am torn by your love for me.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.148
Pain and more pain --

00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:14.209
where are you going with my love?

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:16.009
I am told you will go from here.

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.476
I am told you will leave me here.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.665
My body is numb with grief.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.748
Remember what I said, my love.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.876
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.994
Emily Dickinson once wrote,
"Parting is all we need to know of hell."

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:34.974
How many people have suffered

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.976
in all the millions of years
of human evolution?

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.752
How many people around the world

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:43.641
are dancing with elation
at this very minute?

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:47.909
Romantic love is one of the most powerful
sensations on Earth.

00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:51.811
So, several years ago,
I decided to look into the brain

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:54.365
and study this madness.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.276
Our first study of people
who were happily in love

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.641
has been widely publicized,

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:01.159
so I'm only going to say
very little about it.

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:05.163
We found activity in a tiny,
little factory near the base of the brain

00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:07.333
called the ventral tegmental area.

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.501
We found activity in some cells
called the A10 cells,

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:13.454
cells that actually make
dopamine, a natural stimulant,

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:15.754
and spray it to many brain regions.

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:19.889
Indeed, this part, the VTA,
is part of the brain's reward system.

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:22.486
It's way below your cognitive
thinking process.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.101
It's below your emotions.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.354
It's part of what we call
the reptilian core of the brain,

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:32.624
associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving.

00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:35.754
In fact, the same brain region
where we found activity

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:38.976
becomes active also
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.594
But romantic love is much more
than a cocaine high --

00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:44.929
at least you come down from cocaine.

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:48.234
Romantic love is an obsession,
it possesses you.

00:04:48.258 --> 00:04:49.917
You lose your sense of self.

00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:53.309
You can't stop thinking
about another human being.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.726
Somebody is camping in your head.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.715
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
"My longing had no time when it ceases."

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.975
Wild is love.

00:05:04.683 --> 00:05:07.724
And the obsession can get worse
when you've been rejected.

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:12.976
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,
the neuroscientists on our project,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.977
are looking at the data of the people

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:18.332
who were put into the machine
after they had just been dumped.

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:21.557
It was very difficult actually,
putting these people in the machine,

00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.316
because they were in such bad shape.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.300
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.619
So anyway, we found activity
in three brain regions.

00:05:29.643 --> 00:05:32.114
We found activity in the brain region,

00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:36.729
in exactly the same brain region
associated with intense romantic love.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:37.976
What a bad deal.

00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:40.301
You know, when you've been dumped,

00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:43.522
the one thing you love to do
is just forget about this human being,

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:46.752
and then go on with your life --
but no, you just love them harder.

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:51.163
As the poet Terence,
the Roman poet once said,

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:54.204
he said, "The less my hope,
the hotter my love."

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.464
And indeed, we now know why.

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.706
Two thousand years later,
we can explain this in the brain.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.129
That brain system -- the reward system

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.976
for wanting, for motivation,
for craving, for focus --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.462
becomes more active
when you can't get what you want.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.739
In this case, life's greatest prize:
an appropriate mating partner.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.028
We found activity
in other brain regions also --

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:21.944
in a brain region associated
with calculating gains and losses.

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:24.315
You're lying there,
you're looking at the picture,

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.648
and you're in this machine,

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:27.845
and you're calculating what went wrong.

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:30.417
What have I lost?

00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:34.089
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I
have a little joke about this.

00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:36.976
It comes from a David Mamet play,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.074
and there's two con artists in the play,

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.976
and the woman is conning the man,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.181
and the man looks at the woman and says,

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:47.800
"Oh, you're a bad pony,
I'm not going to bet on you."

00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:50.751
And indeed, it's this part of the brain,

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:52.681
the core of the nucleus accumbens,

00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:55.895
that is becoming active
as you're measuring your gains and losses.

00:06:56.327 --> 00:06:58.673
It's also the brain region
that becomes active

00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:03.594
when you're willing to take enormous risks
for huge gains and huge losses.

00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:06.880
Last but not least,
we found activity in a brain region

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:10.613
associated with deep attachment
to another individual.

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:17.706
No wonder people suffer around the world,
and we have so many crimes of passion.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.846
When you've been rejected in love,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.799
not only are you engulfed
with feelings of romantic love,

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:26.577
but you're feeling deep
attachment to this individual.

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.848
Moreover, this brain circuit
for reward is working,

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:35.048
and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:39.579
and the willingness to risk it all,
to win life's greatest prize.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:44.371
So, what have I learned
from this experiment

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.117
that I would like to tell the world?

00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.519
Foremost, I have come to think

00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:51.965
that romantic love is a drive,
a basic mating drive.

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:53.165
Not the sex drive --

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:56.059
the sex drive gets you looking
for a whole range of partners.

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.589
Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy

00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.411
on just one at a time,
conserve your mating energy,

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:05.093
and start the mating process
with this single individual.

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:08.734
I think of all the poetry
that I've read about romantic love,

00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:12.580
what sums it up best
is something that is said by Plato

00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:14.707
over 2,000 years ago.

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:17.976
He said, "The god of love
lives in a state of need.

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:24.129
It is a need, it is an urge,
it is a homeostatic imbalance.

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:28.129
Like hunger and thirst,
it's almost impossible to stamp out."

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:32.368
I've also come to believe
that romantic love is an addiction:

00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:34.939
a perfectly wonderful addiction
when it's going well,

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:38.035
and a perfectly horrible addiction
when it's going poorly.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.847
And indeed, it has all
of the characteristics of addiction.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:44.224
You focus on the person,
you obsessively think about them,

00:08:44.248 --> 00:08:46.976
you crave them, you distort reality,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.943
your willingness to take enormous
risks to win this person.

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:53.011
And it's got the three main
characteristics of addiction:

00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:55.716
tolerance, you need to see them
more, and more, and more;

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.277
withdrawals;

00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.699
and last: relapse.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:02.349
I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair.

00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:05.256
It's been about eight months,
she's beginning to feel better.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.746
And she was driving along
in her car the other day,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.938
and suddenly she heard a song
on the car radio

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:11.397
that reminded her of this man.

00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.284
Not only did the instant
craving come back,

00:09:14.308 --> 00:09:17.858
but she had to pull over
from the side of the road and cry.

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:20.741
So, one thing I would like
the medical community,

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:23.464
and the legal community,
and even the college community,

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:27.301
to see if they can understand,
that indeed, romantic love

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:30.391
is one of the most addictive
substances on Earth.

00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:33.441
I would also like to tell the world
that animals love.

00:09:34.134 --> 00:09:36.305
There's not an animal on this planet

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:38.725
that will copulate with anything
that comes along.

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:43.446
Too old, too young, too scruffy,
too stupid, and they won't do it.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.976
Unless you're stuck
in a laboratory cage --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.696
and you know, if you spend
your entire life in a little box,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.976
you're not going to be as picky
about who you have sex with,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.877
but I've looked in a hundred species,

00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:58.976
and everywhere in the wild,
animals have favorites.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.003
As a matter of fact,
ethologists know this.

00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:04.976
There are over eight words
for what they call "animal favoritism:"

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.489
selective proceptivity, mate choice,
female choice, sexual choice.

00:10:10.513 --> 00:10:13.489
And indeed, there are now
three academic articles

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:15.976
in which they've looked
at this attraction,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.976
which may only last for a second,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.711
but it's a definite attraction,

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:23.017
and either this same brain region,
this reward system,

00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.594
or the chemicals of that reward
system are involved.

00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:29.232
In fact, I think animal attraction
can be instant --

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:31.976
you can see an elephant
instantly go for another elephant.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I think that this is really the origin

00:10:34.024 --> 00:10:37.165
of what you and I call
"love at first sight."

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:40.554
People have often asked me

00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:44.582
whether what I know about love
has spoiled it for me.

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:46.616
And I just simply say, "Hardly."

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.765
You can know every single ingredient
in a piece of chocolate cake,

00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:52.484
and then when you sit down
and eat that cake,

00:10:52.508 --> 00:10:54.327
you can still feel that joy.

00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:58.009
And certainly, I make all the same
mistakes that everybody else does too,

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:02.272
but it's really deepened my understanding

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:06.222
and compassion, really,
for all human life.

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:09.495
As a matter of fact, in New York,
I often catch myself

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:13.080
looking in baby carriages
and feeling a little sorry for the tot.

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:15.976
And in fact, sometimes
I feel a little sorry

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.999
for the chicken on my dinner plate,

00:11:18.023 --> 00:11:22.545
when I think of how intense
this brain system is.

00:11:23.231 --> 00:11:27.916
Our newest experiment has been hatched

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.594
by my colleague, Art Aron --

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:33.779
putting people who are reporting
that they are still in love,

00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:36.941
in a long-term relationship,
into the functional MRI.

00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:39.318
We've put five people in so far,

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:42.398
and indeed, we found exactly
the same thing.

00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:43.763
They're not lying.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:49.770
The brain areas associated
with intense romantic love

00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:53.795
still become active, 25 years later.

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:56.976
There are still many questions
to be answered

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.746
and asked about romantic love.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.285
The question that I'm working on
right this minute --

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:05.050
and I'm only going to say it
for a second, and then end --

00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:08.149
is, why do you fall in love
with one person, rather than another?

00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:10.976
I never would have
even thought to think of this,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.976
but Match.com, the Internet dating site,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.795
came to me three years ago
and asked me that question.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.144
And I said, I don't know.

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:20.545
I know what happens in the brain,
when you do become in love,

00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:24.086
but I don't know why you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.872
And so, I've spent
the last three years on this.

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:29.908
And there are many reasons
that you fall in love with one person

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:32.423
rather than another,
that psychologists can tell you.

00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:36.280
And we tend to fall in love with somebody
from the same socioeconomic background,

00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:40.138
the same general level of intelligence,
of good looks, the same religious values.

00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:42.976
Your childhood certainly plays a role,
but nobody knows how.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.161
And that's about it, that's all they know.

00:12:45.185 --> 00:12:46.795
No, they've never found

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:51.178
the way two personalities
fit together to make a good relationship.

00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:52.976
So, it began to occur to me

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.699
that maybe your biology pulls you
towards some people rather than another.

00:12:58.072 --> 00:13:02.608
And I have concocted a questionnaire
to see to what degree

00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:06.976
you express dopamine, serotonin,
estrogen and testosterone.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.271
I think we've evolved four
very broad personality types

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:13.976
associated with the ratios
of these four chemicals in the brain.

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:18.619
And on this dating site
that I have created, called Chemistry.com,

00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:22.252
I ask you first a series of questions

00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:25.409
to see to what degree
you express these chemicals,

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:28.469
and I'm watching who chooses who to love.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.408
And 3.7 million people have taken
the questionnaire in America.

00:13:33.432 --> 00:13:37.794
About 600,000 people have taken it
in 33 other countries.

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.498
I'm putting the data together now,

00:13:39.522 --> 00:13:42.842
and at some point --
there will always be magic to love,

00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:46.281
but I think I will come closer
to understanding

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:50.582
why it is you can walk into a room
and everybody is from your background,

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:54.134
your same general level
of intelligence, good looks,

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:56.346
and you don't feel
pulled towards all of them.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.249
I think there's biology to that.

00:13:58.273 --> 00:14:00.834
I think we're going to end up,
in the next few years,

00:14:00.858 --> 00:14:03.048
to understand all kinds
of brain mechanisms

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:06.382
that pull us to one person
rather than another.

00:14:06.406 --> 00:14:08.509
So, I will close with this.

00:14:08.823 --> 00:14:11.380
These are my older people.

00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:17.407
Faulkner said, "The past is not dead,
it's not even past."

00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:21.868
Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage
from our yesteryear in the human brain.

00:14:22.412 --> 00:14:29.162
And so, there's one thing that makes me
pursue my understanding of human nature,

00:14:29.777 --> 00:14:31.778
and this reminds me of it.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.226
These are two women.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.382
Women tend to get intimacy
differently than men do.

00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:38.666
Women get intimacy
from face-to-face talking.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.587
We swivel towards each other,

00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:44.713
we do what we call
the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.

00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:46.300
This is intimacy to women.

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:48.209
I think it comes from millions of years

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.315
of holding that baby
in front of your face,

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:53.749
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:57.366
Men tend to get intimacy
from side-by-side doing.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.760
As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away.

00:15:00.784 --> 00:15:02.483
(Laughter)

00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:07.604
I think it comes from millions of years
sitting behind the bush,

00:15:07.628 --> 00:15:11.666
looking straight ahead, trying to hit
that buffalo on the head with a rock.

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:14.866
I think, for millions of years,
men faced their enemies,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.618
they sat side-by-side with friends.

00:15:17.642 --> 00:15:21.894
So my final statement is: love is in us.

00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:24.486
It's deeply embedded in the brain.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.315
Our challenge is to understand each other.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:28.540
Thank you.

00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:32.984
(Applause)
