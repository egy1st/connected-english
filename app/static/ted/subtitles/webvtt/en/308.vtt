00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As a clergyman,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you can imagine how

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
out of place I feel.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I feel like a fish out of water,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or maybe an owl out of the air.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was preaching in San Jose some time ago,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and my friend Mark Kvamme,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
who helped introduce me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to this conference,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
brought several CEOs

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and leaders

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to have breakfast with me, or I with them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And I was so stimulated.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And had such -- it was an

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
eye-opening experience

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to hear them talk about

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the world that is yet to come

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
through technology

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and science.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I know that we're near the end of this conference,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and some of you may be wondering

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
why they have a speaker

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
from the field of religion.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Richard can answer that,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because he made that decision.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
coming down.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I was to address a conference

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
at a hotel.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And on that elevator a man said,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And another man looked in my direction and said,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And this man looked me up and down

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
for about 10 seconds,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
(Laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I hope

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that you won't feel that these few moments with me

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is not a -- is an anticlimax,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
after all these tremendous

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
talks that you've heard,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I was

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
on an airplane in the east some years ago,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the man sitting across the aisle from me

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And there was a drunk man on there,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and he got up out of his seat two or three times,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and he was making everybody upset

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
by what he was trying to do.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And he was slapping the stewardess

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and pinching her as she went by,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and everybody was upset with him.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And finally, John Belk said,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
"Do you know who's sitting here?"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the man said, "No, who?"

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
He said, "It's Billy Graham,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the preacher."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He said, "You don't say!"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I suppose that that's true

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with thousands of people.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
(Laughter)

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I know that as you have been peering into the future,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and as we've heard some of it here tonight,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I would like to live in that age

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and see what is going to be.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But I won't,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and I know that my time is brief.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because I have Parkinson's disease

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in addition to that,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and some other problems that I won't talk about.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Laughter)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But this is not the first time

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that we've had a technological revolution.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We've had others.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And there's one that I want to talk about.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
In one generation,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the nation of the people of Israel

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
had a tremendous and dramatic change

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that made them a great power in the Near East.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
A man by the name of David

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
came to the throne,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and King David became one of the great leaders

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of his generation.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
He was a man of tremendous leadership.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
He had the favor of God with him.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
He was a brilliant poet,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
philosopher, writer, soldier --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with strategies in battle and conflict

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that people study even today.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But about two centuries before David,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the Hittites

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
had discovered the secret

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
of smelting and processing of iron,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and, slowly, that skill spread.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But they wouldn't allow the Israelis

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to look into it, or to have any.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But David changed all of that,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and he introduced the Iron Age

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to Israel.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and which archaeologists have found,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
that in present-day Palestine,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
there are evidences of that generation.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, instead of crude tools

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
made of sticks and stones,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Israel now had iron plows,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and sickles, and hoes

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and military weapons.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And in the course of one generation,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Israel was completely changed.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The introduction of iron, in some ways,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
had an impact

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a little bit like the microchip

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
has had on our generation.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
David found

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that there were many problems that technology could not solve.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
There were many problems still left.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
How do we solve these three problems

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that I'd like to mention?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The first one that David saw

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
was human evil.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Where does it come from?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
How do we solve it?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Over again and again

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
in the Psalms,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
David describes the evils of the human race.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And yet he says,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
"He restores my soul."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
as this conference vividly demonstrates.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We've seen under the sea,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
three miles down,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
or galaxies hundreds of billions of years

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
out in the future.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But on the other hand,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
something is wrong.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Our battleships,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
our soldiers,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
are on a frontier now,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
almost ready to go to war

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
with Iraq.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now, what causes this?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Why do we have these wars in every generation,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and in every part of the world?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And revolutions?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We can't get along with other people,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
even in our own families.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of self-destructive habits we can't break.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Even the most sophisticated among us

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
seem powerless to break this cycle.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I would like to see Oracle

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
take up that,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
or

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
some other

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
technological geniuses work on this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
How do we change man,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
so that he doesn't lie and cheat,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and our newspapers are not filled with stories

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
of fraud in business or labor

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
or athletics or wherever?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The Bible says the problem is within us,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
within our hearts and our souls.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Our problem is that we are separated

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
from our Creator,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
which we call God,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and we need to have our souls restored,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
something only God can do.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Jesus said, "For out of the heart

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
come evil thoughts:

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
murders, sexual immorality,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
theft, false testimonies,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
slander."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
was not a religious man,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and it's from our hearts

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that it must be plucked out."

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Albert Einstein --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and I met

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Mr. Einstein.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
nobody was qualified to give him one.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
(Laughter)

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But he made this statement.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
than to denature the evil spirit of man."

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And many of you, I'm sure,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
have thought about that

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and puzzled over it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You've seen people

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
take beneficial technological advances,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
such as the Internet we've heard about tonight,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and twist them into something corrupting.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that bring down whole systems.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
horribly used.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The problem is not technology.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The problem is the person or persons using it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
King David said

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that he knew the depths of his own soul.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
He couldn't free himself from personal problems

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and personal evils

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
that included murder and adultery.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yet King David sought God's forgiveness,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and said, "You can restore my soul."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
You see, the Bible teaches

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that we're more than a body and a mind.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We are a soul.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And there's something inside of us

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that is beyond our understanding.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
That's the part of us that yearns

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
for God, or something more

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
than we find in technology.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Your soul is that part of you that

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
yearns for meaning in life,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and which seeks for something beyond this life.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I find [that] young people all over the world

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
are searching for something.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and I have many questions and answer periods, and

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
or Oxford --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I've spoken at all of those universities.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
no, it's about two months from now --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
to give a lecture.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the last few times I've been there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And it'll be on

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
these questions:

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
What's life all about? Why am I here?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Even if you have no religious belief,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
there are times when you wonder that there's something else.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Thomas Edison also said,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and in the working of the universe,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I remember once,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
at a White House dinner.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and I said,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
What shall I talk to her about?"

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And he surprised me with the answer.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
That's what she's really interested in."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that's what we talked about,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and it was a stimulating conversation.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And afterward, she said,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
"You know, I'm an atheist,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
but I know that there's something up there

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
higher than we are."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The second problem

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that King David realized he could not solve

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
was the problem of human suffering.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and he said,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
certain types of human suffering.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But I'm --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I admit that I'm very grateful

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
for all the medical advances

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that have kept me in relatively good health

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
all these years.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And when you speak as much as I do,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
three or four times a day,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
you get rusty.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
That's the reason I'm using this podium

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and using these notes.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I'm ad-libbing.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I'm not reading. I never read an address.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I talk ad lib.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But tonight, I've

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
got some notes here so that if

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I begin to forget,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
which I do sometimes,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I've got something I can turn to.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But even here among us,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
most --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
in the most advanced society in the world,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
we have poverty.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
We have families that self-destruct,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
friends that betray us.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I've never met a person in the world

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that didn't have a problem

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
or a worry.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
that we haven't answered.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yet David again and again said

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that he would turn to God.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
The final problem that David knew he could not solve

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
was death.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Many commentators have said that death

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is the forbidden subject of our generation.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Most people live as if

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
they're never going to die.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Technology projects the myth

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
of control over our mortality.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We see people on our screens.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
as she was in person,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and our -- many young people think she's still alive.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
They don't know that she's dead.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
The old stars, they come to life.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And they're --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But death is inevitable.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I spoke some time ago to

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
a joint session of Congress, last year.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And we were meeting in that room,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
the statue room.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
About 300 of them were there.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
or whoever."

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I said, "We're all going to die.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And we have that in common with all these great men of the past

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that are staring down at us."

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And it's often difficult for young people

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
to understand that.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
he said, there's every activity under heaven.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
There's a time to be born,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and there's a time to die.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I've stood at the deathbed

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
of several famous people,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
whom you would know.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I've talked to them.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I've seen them in those agonizing moments

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
when they were scared to death.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And yet, a few years earlier,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
death never crossed their mind.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I talked to a woman this past week

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
whose father

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
was a famous doctor.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
But she said,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
as he came to die,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
he sat up on the side of the bed one day,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And he said, for the first time in his life

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
he'd thought about the inevitable,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and about God.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Was there a God?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
A few years ago, a university student asked me,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
is the brevity of life.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It passes so fast."

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
But it does not need to have to be that way.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Wernher von Braun,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
"science and religion are not antagonists.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
On the contrary, they're sisters."

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
He put it on a personal basis.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And he said, "Speaking for myself,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
serves only to confirm

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
a belief in the certainty of a creator."

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
He also said,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
"In our search to know God,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
The reality of this life and His resurrection

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
is the hope of mankind."

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and in France, and in different parts of the world --

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And I was invited one day to visit

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Chancellor Adenauer,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
since the war.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And he once -- and he said to me,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
he said, "Young man." He said,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And I said, "Sir, I do."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
He said, "So do I."

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
He said, "When I leave office,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I'm going to spend my time writing a book

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
on why Jesus Christ rose again,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and why it's so important to believe that."

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
In one of his plays,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Alexander Solzhenitsyn

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
depicts a man dying,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
who says to those gathered around his bed,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
is when one is dying."

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Blaise Pascal

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
asked exactly that question

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
in seventeenth-century France.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Pascal has been called the architect

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
of modern civilization.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
He was a brilliant scientist

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
at the frontiers of mathematics,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
even as a teenager.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
and a creator of the first model of a computer.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And of course, you are all familiar with

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
the computer language named for him.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
of evil, suffering and death.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
He was astounded

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
at the phenomenon we've been considering:

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
that people can achieve extraordinary heights

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
in science, the arts and human enterprise,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
and have -- and self-hatreds.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
of genius and self-delusion.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
On November 23,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
1654,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Pascal had a profound religious experience.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
He wrote in his journal these words:

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
"I submit myself,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
absolutely,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
to Jesus Christ, my redeemer."

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
A French historian said,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
two centuries later,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
"Seldom has so mighty an intellect

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
submitted with such humility

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
to the authority of Jesus Christ."

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
could bring us back into harmony,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
but he believed

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
He experienced it in a way that went beyond

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
scientific observation and reason.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
It was he who penned the well-known words,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
"The heart has its reasons,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
which reason knows not of."

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
and open yourself to his love,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
But if instead you bet that there is no God,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
For Pascal, scientific knowledge

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
paled beside the knowledge of God.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
The knowledge of God was far beyond

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
anything that ever crossed his mind.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
He was ready to face him

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
when he died at the age of 39.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
King David lived to be 70,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
a long time in his era.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Yet he too had to face death,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
and he wrote these words:

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I will fear no evil,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
for you are with me."

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
This was David's answer to three dilemmas

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
of evil, suffering and death.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
It can be yours, as well,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
as you seek the living God

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
and allow him to fill your life

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and give you hope for the future.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
When I was 17 years of age,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
when I came home from school.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And there were 20 of them that I had --

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
that I was responsible for,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
and I worked on the farm

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
and tried to keep up with my studies.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I didn't make good grades in high school.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I didn't make them in college, until

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
something happened in my heart.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
One day, I was faced face-to-face

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
with Christ.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I'm the embodiment of all truth."

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
He was a liar.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Or he was insane.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Or he was what he claimed to be.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Which was he?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I had to make that decision.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I couldn't prove it.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I couldn't take it to a laboratory

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
and experiment with it.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
But by faith I said, I believe him,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
and he came into my heart

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
and changed my life.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And now I'm ready,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
when I hear that call,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
to go into the presence of God.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Thank you, and God bless all of you.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:41.000
(Applause)

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Richard Wurman: You did it.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Thanks.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:03.000
(Applause)
