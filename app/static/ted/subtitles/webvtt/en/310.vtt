00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:04.191
Brain magic to me indicates
that area of magic

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:06.692
dealing with psychological
and mind-reading effects.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.363
So unlike traditional magic,
it uses the power of words,

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:12.983
linguistic deception,
non-verbal communication

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:17.007
and various other techniques
to create the illusion of a sixth sense.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.952
I'm going to show you all how easy it is

00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:22.302
to manipulate the human mind
once you know how.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.431
I want everybody downstairs also
to join in with me and everybody.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:28.748
I want everybody to put out your hands
like this for me, first of all.

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:30.374
OK, clap them together, once.

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:31.976
OK, reverse your hands.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.976
Now, follow my actions exactly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.048
Now about half the audience has
their left hand up. Why is that?

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.699
OK, swap them around,
put your right hand up.

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:42.296
Cross your hands over,
so your right hand goes over,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.297
interlace your fingers like this,

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:47.187
then make sure your right thumb
is outside your left thumb --

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:48.360
that's very important.

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:50.670
Yours is the other way around,
so swap it around.

00:00:50.694 --> 00:00:53.210
Excellent, OK. Extend
your fingers like this for me.

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:55.454
All right. Tap them together once.

00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:59.742
OK, now, if you did not allow me
to deceive your minds,

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.422
you would all be able to do this.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.582
(Laughter)

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:08.795
(Laughter ends)

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.326
Now you can see how easy it is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.976
for me to manipulate the human mind,
once you know how.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.683
(Laughter)

00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:17.945
Now, I remember when I was about 15,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.539
(Laughter)

00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:21.482
I read a copy of Life magazine,

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:26.345
which detailed a story
about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.092
who could sense printed letters --

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:29.988
there's still people trying to do it --

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:31.139
(Laughter)

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:34.544
-- who could sense printed letters
and even sense colors, just by touch.

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:35.976
And she was completely blind.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.239
She could also read
the serial numbers on bills

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:40.740
when they were placed,
face down, on a hard surface.

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:43.976
Now, I was fascinated,
but at the same time, skeptical.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.239
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:50.976
You know, if you actually think about it,
if somebody is totally blind --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.642
a guy yesterday did a demonstration
in one of the rooms,

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:56.934
where people had to close their eyes
and they could just hear things.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.872
And it's just a really weird thing
to try and figure out.

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.145
How could somebody read
using their fingertips?

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.884
Now earlier on, as part of a TV show
that I have coming up on MTV,

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:07.976
I attempted to give
a similar demonstration

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.864
of what is now known as second sight.

00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:11.976
So, let's take a look.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.976
(Video) Man: There we go.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.976
I'm going to guide you into the car.

Man: You're OK, keep on going.

Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.976
I'm going to take you
to a secret location, OK?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.964
Kathryn, there was no way
you could see through that blindfold.

KT: OK, but don't say my name like that.
KB: But you're OK?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.276
Take it off, you're OK.
We'll stop for a second.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.348

of what I'm going to see.

You're OK. You're safe.

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:43.976
KB: Thank you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.976
By the way, two days ago,
we were going to film this

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.976
down there, at the race course,
and we got a guy into a car,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.976
and we got a camera man in the back,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.537
but halfway through the drive,

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.007
he told me he had,
I think it was a nine-millimeter,

00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:57.200
stuck to his leg.

00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:59.310
So, I stopped pretty quick,
and that was it.

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:02.603
So, do you believe it's possible
to see through somebody else's eyes?

00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:03.706
That's the question.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.235
Now, most people here
would automatically say no.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.403
OK, but I want you to realize some facts.

00:05:08.427 --> 00:05:10.648
I couldn't see through the blindfold.

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:13.482
The car was not gimmicked
or tricked in any way.

00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:16.444
The girl, I'd never met before, all right.

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.948
So, I want you to just think
about it for a moment.

00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:20.626
A lot of people try to come up

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.317
with a logical solution
to what just happened, all right.

00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:26.719
But because your brains are not
trained in the art of deception,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.184
the solutions you come up with

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:30.564
will, 99 percent of the time,
be way off the mark.

00:05:31.342 --> 00:05:33.976
This is because magic
is all about directing attention.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.917
If, for instance, I didn't want
you to look at my right hand,

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:38.176
then I don't look at it.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.971
But if I wanted you
to look at my right hand,

00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.217
then I look at it, too.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.360
You see, it's very simple,
once you know how,

00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:46.087
but very complicated in other ways.

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.628
I'm going to give you
some demonstrations right now.

00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:51.510
I need two people to help me out
real quick. Can you come up?

00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:55.570
And let's see, down at the end, here,
can you also come up, real quick?

00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:56.976
Do you mind? Yes, at the end.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.381
OK, give them a round of applause
as they come up.

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:01.381

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:09.993
You just take a seat
over here for a second.

00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:11.976
I'm going to use you again, in a moment.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.572
Can you take a seat
right over here, if you don't mind.

00:08:14.596 --> 00:08:15.747
Sit right here.
Man: OK.

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:18.976
KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.976
Now, what I want you to do
is look directly at me, OK,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.143
just take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.717
letting it out through
your mouth, and relax.

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:30.459
Allow your eyes to close,
on five, four, three, two, one.

00:08:30.483 --> 00:08:31.976
Close your eyes right now.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.976
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.953
I'm merely placing you in a heightened
state of synchronicity,

00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:38.976
so our minds are along the same lines.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.976
And as you sink and drift and float
into this relaxed state of mind,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.976
I'm going to take your left hand,
and just place it up here.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.171
I want you to hold it there
just for a moment,

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:50.046
and I only want you to allow your hand

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.449
to sink and drift and float
back to the tabletop

00:08:52.473 --> 00:08:53.976
at the same rate and speed

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.195
as you drift and float into this
relaxed state of awareness,

00:08:57.219 --> 00:09:00.258
and allow it to go all the way
down to the tabletop.

00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:03.401
That's it, all the way down,
all the way down.

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:06.028
and further, and further.

00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:07.321
Excellent.

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:10.250
I want you to allow your hand
to stick firmly to the tabletop.

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:12.064
OK, now, allow it to stay there.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.582
OK, now, in a moment,
you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,

00:09:15.606 --> 00:09:17.651
and I want you
to be aware of the pressure.

00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:23.975
Just be aware of the pressure.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.437
And I only want you to allow your hand

00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:30.985
to float slowly back up from the tabletop
as you feel the pressure release,

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:33.099
but only when you feel
the pressure release.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.976
Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.021
Man: Yes.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.362
KB: Hold it right there.

00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:46.481
And only when you feel
the pressure go back,

00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:48.741
allow your hand to drift
back to the tabletop,

00:09:48.765 --> 00:09:50.480
but only when you feel the pressure.

00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:56.631
(Laughter)

00:09:56.655 --> 00:09:59.036
OK, that was wonderfully done.
Let's try it again.

00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:13.559
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea,
let's try something even more interesting.

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.583
Allow it to stick firmly
to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.

00:10:16.607 --> 00:10:19.623
Can you stand up?
Just stand, stage forward.

00:10:19.647 --> 00:10:22.106
I want you to point directly
at his forehead.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.328
OK.

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:25.605
Imagine a connection between you and him.

00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:28.624
Only when you want
the pressure to be released,

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:30.290
make an upward gesture, like this,

00:10:30.314 --> 00:10:32.307
but only when you want it to be released.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.980
You can wait as long as you want,

00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:36.100
but only when you want
the pressure released.

00:10:43.157 --> 00:10:44.680
OK, let's try it again.

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:46.976
OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.976
Point directly at his forehead.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.858
Only when you want the pressure
released, we'll try it again.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.976
OK, it worked that time, excellent.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.976
And hold it there, both of you.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.239
Only when you want the pressure
to go back, make a downward gesture.

00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:03.835
You can wait as long as you want.

00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:09.809
You did it pretty quickly,
but it went down, OK.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.976
Now, I want you to be aware
that in a moment,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.408
when I snap my fingers,
your eyes will open, again.

00:11:14.432 --> 00:11:17.627
It's OK to remember to forget,
or forget to remember what happened.

00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:20.421
Most people ask you, "What
the hell just happened up here?"

00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:22.828
But it's OK that even though
you're not hypnotized,

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:25.084
you will forget everything that happened.

00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:27.976
On five, four, three, two, one --
open your eyes, wide awake.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.304
Give them a round of applause,
as they go back to their seats.

00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:32.841
(Applause)

00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:34.232
OK, you can go back.

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:37.525
(Applause)

00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:40.500
I once saw a film called
"The Gods Are Crazy."

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:42.976
Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.608
Remember when they threw
the Coke out of the airplane,

00:11:45.632 --> 00:11:47.960
and it landed on the ground,
and it didn't break?

00:11:47.984 --> 00:11:50.308
Now, see, that's because
Coke bottles are solid.

00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:54.133
It's nearly impossible
to break a Coke bottle.

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:55.554
Do you want to try it?

00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:59.675
Good job. She's not taking any chances.

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:00.976
(Laughter)

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.381
You see, psychokinesis
is the paranormal influence

00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:05.888
of the mind on physical
events and processes.

00:12:06.382 --> 00:12:07.976
For some magicians or mentalists,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.976
sometimes the spoon will bend
or melt, sometimes it will not.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.484
Sometimes the object will slide
across the table, sometimes it will not.

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:17.780
It depends on how much
energy you have that day,

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:18.868
so on and so forth.

00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:21.750
We're going to try an experiment
in psychokinesis, right now.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.903
Come right over here, next to me.
Excellent.

00:12:23.927 --> 00:12:25.712
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:29.308
Make sure it is solid, there's only
one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:32.333
And you can whack it against the table,
if you want; be careful.

00:12:32.357 --> 00:12:34.357
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.

00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:37.731
I want you to pinch right here
with two fingers and your thumb.

00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:40.309
Excellent.
Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:42.286
I want you to examine the shard of glass.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.885
Careful, it's sharp.
Just hold on to it for a moment.

00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:46.076
Now, hold it out here.

00:12:46.101 --> 00:12:50.001
I want you to imagine, right now,
a broken relationship from many years ago.

00:12:50.547 --> 00:12:53.628
I want you to imagine
all the negative energy

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:55.804
from that broken
relationship, from that guy,

00:12:55.828 --> 00:12:58.332
being imparted into the broken
piece of glass,

00:12:58.356 --> 00:12:59.976
which will represent him, OK.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.048
But I want you to take this
very seriously.

00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:04.358
Stare at the glass,
ignore everybody right here.

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:07.505
In a moment, you'll feel
a certain sensation, OK,

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:09.345
and when you feel that sensation,

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:11.976
I want you to drop the piece
of glass into the bottle.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.897
Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:17.976
(Laughter)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.413
I'm trying to be good here.

00:13:19.437 --> 00:13:21.247
OK, and when you feel the sensation --

00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:23.530
it might take a while --
drop it into the glass.

00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:36.809
OK, drop it in.

00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:39.976
Now, imagine all that negative
energy in there.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.633
Imagine his name
and imagine him inside the glass.

00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:44.901
And I want you to release
that negative energy

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.449
by shaking it from side to side.

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:48.567
(Burst)

00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:50.976
(Laughter)

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.532
That was a lot of negative energy,
built up in there.

00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:55.618
(Laughter)

00:13:55.642 --> 00:13:58.976
(Applause)

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.001
I also want you to look at me
and think of his name.

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:06.000
OK, think of how many letters
in the title of his name.

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:07.706
There's five letters in the title.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.977
You didn't react to that,
so it's four letters.

00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.976
Think of one of the letters in the title.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.976
There's a K in his name, there is a K.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.376
I knew that because my name
starts with a K also,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.237
but his name doesn't start
with a K, it starts with an M.

00:14:19.261 --> 00:14:21.683
Tell Mike I said hello,
the next time you see him.

00:14:21.707 --> 00:14:23.376
Was that his name?
Nicole: Mm-hmm.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.177
KB: OK, give her a round of applause.

00:14:25.201 --> 00:14:30.809

Thank you.

00:14:38.492 --> 00:14:40.976
I've got one more thing
to share with you right now.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.381
Actually, Chris, I was going
to pick you for this,

00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:45.644
but instead of picking you,
can you hop up here

00:14:45.668 --> 00:14:47.976
and pick a victim
for this next experiment?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.572
And it should be a male victim,
that's the only thing.

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:51.976
Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.386

to come back another year.

a seat, right behind here. Excellent.

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:14.976
Now, Steve -- oh, you
can check underneath.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.363
Go ahead, I've no fancy
assistants underneath there.

00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:21.902
They insist that because I was a magician,

00:15:21.926 --> 00:15:23.466
put a nice, black tablecloth on.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.903
There you are, OK.

00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:25.976

One, two, three and four.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.239
Now, they're all the exact
same except this one

00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:35.978
obviously has a stainless steel
spike sticking out of it.

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.467
I want you to examine it,
and make sure it's solid.

00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:42.102
Happy?

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:44.080

to stand in front of the table,

When I stand in front of the table,

I want you to put the cups on the plinths,

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.809
in any order you want,
and then mix them all up,

the spike is, all right?

ahead and mix them up, now.

so swivel around on your chair.

No, stay around, OK.

00:16:58.876 --> 00:17:00.558
Now, Steve, look back.

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:04.352
Now you don't know where the spike is,
and I don't know where it is either.

00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:06.843
Now, is there any way to see
through this blindfold?

00:17:07.522 --> 00:17:08.554
SJ: Put this on?

00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:11.325

to see through it? No?

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.976
SJ: No, I can't see through it.
KB: Excellent.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.864
Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold.

00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:18.321
Don't stack them up, OK.
Give them an extra mix up.

00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:21.626
Don't move the cups, I don't want
anybody to see where the spike is,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.726
but give the plinths an extra mix up,
and then line them up.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.596
I'll put the blindfold on.
Give them an extra mix up.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.193
No messing around this time.
OK, go ahead, mix them up.

00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:32.217
My hand is at risk here.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:35.976
(Laughter)

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.976
Tell me when you're done.
SJ: Done.

Put out your hand. Your right hand.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.976
Tell me when I'm over a cup.

(Applause ends)

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.572
Now, if I go this way,
is there another cup over here?

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:15.976
SJ: Can we do the left hand?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.976

he do the left hand. Absolutely not.

OK, give me both hands.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.792
Now, put them on both cups.

00:18:45.816 --> 00:18:49.442
Do you think the spike
is under your left or your right hand?

00:18:49.506 --> 00:18:50.976
SJ: Neither.

Now, remember, you made
all the decisions all along.

Psychologists, figure this out.
