00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:03.516
When I was President of the American
Psychological Association,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.166
they tried to media-train me.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.753
And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.878
what I'm going to be talking about today,

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:15.976
which is the eleventh reason
to be optimistic.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.176
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them;

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.294
I'm going to give you the eleventh.

00:00:24.318 --> 00:00:28.077
So they came to me, CNN,
and they said, "Professor Seligman --

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.763
would you tell us about the state
of psychology today?

00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:34.704
We'd like to interview you about that."

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:35.942
And I said, "Great."

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:40.299
And she said, "But this is CNN,
so you only get a sound bite."

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.777
I said, "Well, how many words do I get?"

00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:46.184
And she said, "Well, one."

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.564
(Laughter)

00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:50.357
And the cameras rolled, and she said,

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.698
"Professor Seligman,
what is the state of psychology today?"

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:56.387
"Good."

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.539
(Laughter)

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:01.563
"Cut! Cut. That won't do.

00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:05.686
We'd really better give
you a longer sound bite."

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.440
"How many words do I get this time?"

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:08.880
"Well, you get two."

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:10.636
(Laughter)

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.764
"Doctor Seligman, what is the state
of psychology today?"

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:16.779
"Not good."

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:23.803
(Laughter)

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:29.729
"Look, Doctor Seligman,

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:32.747
we can see you're really
not comfortable in this medium.

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:35.160
We'd better give you a real sound bite.

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.739
This time you can have three words.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.718
Professor Seligman, what is the state
of psychology today?"

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.352
"Not good enough."

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.089
That's what I'm going to be talking about.

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:52.222
I want to say why psychology
was good, why it was not good,

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:56.346
and how it may become,
in the next 10 years, good enough.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:02:01.054
And by parallel summary, I want to say
the same thing about technology,

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:02.783
about entertainment and design,

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:04.988
because I think the issues
are very similar.

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:08.009
So, why was psychology good?

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:12.976
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology
worked within the disease model.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.976
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.023
and I introduced myself to my seatmate,
and told them what I did,

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:20.640
they'd move away from me,

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:24.313
because, quite rightly, they were saying

00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:26.936
psychology is about finding
what's wrong with you.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.371
Spot the loony.

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:32.350
And now, when I tell people
what I do, they move toward me.

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:37.180
What was good about psychology --

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:40.226
about the $30 billion
investment NIMH made,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.976
about working in the disease model,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.457
about what you mean by psychology --

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.871
is that, 60 years ago,
none of the disorders were treatable;

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:50.807
it was entirely smoke and mirrors.

00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:53.294
And now, 14 of the disorders
are treatable,

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:55.222
two of them actually curable.

00:02:55.731 --> 00:03:00.456
And the other thing that happened
is that a science developed,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.408
a science of mental illness.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:07.208
We found out we could take fuzzy concepts

00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:10.212
like depression, alcoholism,

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:11.827
and measure them with rigor;

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.098
that we could create a classification
of the mental illnesses;

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:21.125
that we could understand
the causality of the mental illnesses.

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.976
We could look across time
at the same people --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.977
people, for example, who were genetically
vulnerable to schizophrenia --

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:34.213
and ask what the contribution
of mothering, of genetics are,

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.601
and we could isolate third variables

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:38.976
by doing experiments
on the mental illnesses.

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.991
And best of all, we were able,
in the last 50 years,

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:46.844
to invent drug treatments
and psychological treatments.

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:50.976
And then we were able
to test them rigorously,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.293
in random-assignment,
placebo-controlled designs,

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.569
throw out the things that didn't work,

00:03:56.593 --> 00:03:58.317
keep the things that actively did.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.859
The conclusion of that is,

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:04.976
psychology and psychiatry
of the last 60 years

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.153
can actually claim that we can make
miserable people less miserable.

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:12.810
And I think that's terrific.

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:14.220
I'm proud of it.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:21.401
But what was not good,
the consequences of that,

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:22.931
were three things.

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:24.733
The first was moral;

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:29.551
that psychologists and psychiatrists
became victimologists, pathologizers;

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:32.617
that our view of human nature
was that if you were in trouble,

00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.038
bricks fell on you.

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:37.155
And we forgot that people
made choices and decisions.

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:38.677
We forgot responsibility.

00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:40.743
That was the first cost.

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:44.976
The second cost was
that we forgot about you people.

00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:49.076
We forgot about improving normal lives.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.976
We forgot about a mission to make
relatively untroubled people happier,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.780
more fulfilled, more productive.

00:04:57.804 --> 00:05:01.110
And "genius," "high-talent,"
became a dirty word.

00:05:01.527 --> 00:05:03.063
No one works on that.

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:06.976
And the third problem
about the disease model is,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.281
in our rush to do something
about people in trouble,

00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:14.021
in our rush to do something
about repairing damage,

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:18.048
it never occurred to us
to develop interventions

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:21.831
to make people happier --
positive interventions.

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.176
So that was not good.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.029
And so that's what led people
like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,

00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:30.962
Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:33.846
to work in something I call,
"positive psychology,"

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.282
which has three aims.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:40.565
The first is that psychology
should be just as concerned

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.305
with human strength
as it is with weakness.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.646
It should be just as concerned
with building strength

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.808
as with repairing damage.

00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:53.515
It should be interested
in the best things in life.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.413
And it should be just as concerned

00:05:55.437 --> 00:05:59.150
with making the lives
of normal people fulfilling,

00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:03.123
and with genius,
with nurturing high talent.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.551
So in the last 10 years
and the hope for the future,

00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:11.976
we've seen the beginnings
of a science of positive psychology,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.175
a science of what makes life worth living.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.084
It turns out that we can measure
different forms of happiness.

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:22.588
And any of you, for free,
can go to that website --

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:24.003
[www.authentichappiness.org]

00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:26.506
and take the entire panoply
of tests of happiness.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.976
You can ask, how do you stack
up for positive emotion, for meaning,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.028
for flow, against literally tens
of thousands of other people?

00:06:35.718 --> 00:06:40.976
We created the opposite of the diagnostic
manual of the insanities:

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.221
a classification of the strengths
and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.451
how they're defined, how to diagnose them,

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.293
what builds them
and what gets in their way.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.439
We found that we could discover
the causation of the positive states,

00:06:57.463 --> 00:07:00.976
the relationship between left
hemispheric activity

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and right hemispheric activity,
as a cause of happiness.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.477
I've spent my life working
on extremely miserable people,

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:12.888
and I've asked the question:

00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:16.565
How do extremely miserable people
differ from the rest of you?

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:20.976
And starting about six years ago,
we asked about extremely happy people.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.540
How do they differ from the rest of us?

00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:27.047
It turns out there's one way,
very surprising --

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.739
they're not more religious,
they're not in better shape,

00:07:29.763 --> 00:07:32.851
they don't have more money,
they're not better looking,

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:35.630
they don't have more good events
and fewer bad events.

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:39.042
The one way in which they differ:
they're extremely social.

00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:43.505
They don't sit in seminars
on Saturday morning.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.484
(Laughter)

00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:49.477
They don't spend time alone.

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.699
Each of them is in a romantic relationship

00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:54.871
and each has a rich repertoire of friends.

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:59.272
But watch out here -- this is merely
correlational data, not causal,

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:02.894
and it's about happiness
in the first, "Hollywood" sense,

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.130
I'm going to talk about,

00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:08.320
happiness of ebullience
and giggling and good cheer.

00:08:08.344 --> 00:08:11.179
And I'm going to suggest to you
that's not nearly enough,

00:08:11.203 --> 00:08:12.353
in just a moment.

00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:17.805
We found we could begin to look
at interventions over the centuries,

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:19.622
from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.

00:08:19.646 --> 00:08:24.429
About 120 interventions have been proposed
that allegedly make people happy.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:29.478
And we find that we've been able
to manualize many of them,

00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:31.421
and we actually carry out

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:35.087
random-assignment efficacy
and effectiveness studies.

00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:39.267
That is, which ones actually
make people lastingly happier?

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.518
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you
about some of those results.

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:48.976
But the upshot of this is that the mission
I want psychology to have,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.487
in addition to its mission
of curing the mentally ill,

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:56.785
and in addition to its mission of making
miserable people less miserable,

00:08:56.809 --> 00:09:00.380
is, can psychology actually
make people happier?

00:09:00.762 --> 00:09:04.908
And to ask that question -- "happy"
is not a word I use very much --

00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:06.848
we've had to break it down

00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:09.404
into what I think
is askable about "happy."

00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:12.414
And I believe there are three different --

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:16.462
I call them "different" because different
interventions build them,

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:18.887
it's possible to have one
rather than the other --

00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:20.888
three different happy lives.

00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:24.029
The first happy life is the pleasant life.

00:09:24.053 --> 00:09:27.438
This is a life in which you have
as much positive emotion

00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:28.976
as you possibly can,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.101
and the skills to amplify it.

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.305
The second is a life of engagement:

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:38.694
a life in your work, your parenting,
your love, your leisure;

00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:40.024
time stops for you.

00:09:41.142 --> 00:09:43.190
That's what Aristotle was talking about.

00:09:43.214 --> 00:09:45.281
And third, the meaningful life.

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:47.976
I want to say a little bit
about each of those lives

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.817
and what we know about them.

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:54.819
The first life is the pleasant life,
and it's simply, as best we can find it,

00:09:54.843 --> 00:09:57.130
it's having as many
of the pleasures as you can,

00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:59.263
as much positive emotion as you can,

00:09:59.553 --> 00:10:05.775
and learning the skills -- savoring,
mindfulness -- that amplify them,

00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:08.976
that stretch them over time and space.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.976
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.508
and it's why positive psychology
is not happy-ology,

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:18.409
and why it doesn't end here.

00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:21.976
The first drawback is,
it turns out the pleasant life,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.437
your experience of positive emotion,

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:29.382
is about 50 percent heritable,

00:10:29.406 --> 00:10:32.976
and, in fact, not very modifiable.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.539
So the different tricks
that Matthieu and I and others know

00:10:37.563 --> 00:10:41.174
about increasing the amount
of positive emotion in your life

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:45.174
are 15 to 20 percent tricks,
getting more of it.

00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:49.738
Second is that positive
emotion habituates.

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:53.562
It habituates rapidly, indeed.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.956
It's all like French vanilla ice cream:

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.595
the first taste is 100 percent;

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:00.788
by the time you're down
to the sixth taste,

00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:01.969
it's gone.

00:11:03.657 --> 00:11:06.789
And, as I said,
it's not particularly malleable.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.307
And this leads to the second life.

00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:12.269
I have to tell you about my friend Len,

00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:18.204
to talk about why positive psychology
is more than positive emotion,

00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:19.976
more than building pleasure.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.976
In two of the three great arenas
of life, by the time Len was 30,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.424
Len was enormously successful.

00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:29.976
The first arena was work.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.636
By the time he was 20,
he was an options trader.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.087
By the time he was 25,
he was a multimillionaire

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.457
and the head of an options
trading company.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.147
Second, in play, he's a national
champion bridge player.

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:49.976
But in the third great arena of life,
love, Len is an abysmal failure.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.942
And the reason he was,
was that Len is a cold fish.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.150
(Laughter)

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:00.000
Len is an introvert.

00:12:02.532 --> 00:12:05.976
American women said to Len,
when he dated them,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.976
"You're no fun. You don't have
positive emotion. Get lost."

00:12:10.787 --> 00:12:15.976
And Len was wealthy enough to be able
to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.744
who for five years tried
to find the sexual trauma

00:12:19.768 --> 00:12:23.194
that had somehow locked
positive emotion inside of him.

00:12:23.737 --> 00:12:26.891
But it turned out there wasn't
any sexual trauma.

00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:29.106
It turned out that --

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.509
Len grew up in Long Island

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:37.115
and he played football
and watched football, and played bridge.

00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:42.586
Len is in the bottom five percent
of what we call positive affectivities.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.395
The question is: Is Len unhappy?

00:12:44.658 --> 00:12:46.077
And I want to say, not.

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:49.386
Contrary to what psychology told us

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.562
about the bottom 50 percent
of the human race in positive affectivity,

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:56.178
I think Len is one
of the happiest people I know.

00:12:56.202 --> 00:12:58.848
He's not consigned
to the hell of unhappiness,

00:12:58.872 --> 00:13:02.787
and that's because Len, like most of you,

00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:04.873
is enormously capable of flow.

00:13:04.897 --> 00:13:07.871
When he walks onto the floor
of the American Exchange

00:13:07.895 --> 00:13:09.645
at 9:30 in the morning,

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:11.449
time stops for him.

00:13:11.473 --> 00:13:13.235
And it stops till the closing bell.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.159
When the first card is played
till 10 days later,

00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:17.541
when the tournament is over,

00:13:17.565 --> 00:13:18.975
time stops for Len.

00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:22.888
And this is indeed
what Mike Csikszentmihalyi

00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:24.814
has been talking about, about flow.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:28.215
And it's distinct from pleasure
in a very important way:

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:33.643
pleasure has raw feel -- you know
it's happening; it's thought and feeling.

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:36.756
But what Mike told you
yesterday -- during flow ...

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.024
you can't feel anything.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.223
You're one with the music.

00:13:44.664 --> 00:13:45.917
Time stops.

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.835
You have intense concentration.

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:52.610
And this is indeed the characteristic
of what we think of as the good life.

00:13:53.102 --> 00:13:55.887
And we think there's a recipe for it,

00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:58.505
and it's knowing what
your highest strengths are --

00:13:58.529 --> 00:14:00.823
again, there's a valid test

00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:03.230
of what your five highest strengths are --

00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:05.983
and then re-crafting your life

00:14:06.007 --> 00:14:09.267
to use them as much as you possibly can.

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.976
Re-crafting your work, your love,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.757
your play, your friendship,
your parenting.

00:14:14.781 --> 00:14:16.361
Just one example.

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:20.696
One person I worked with
was a bagger at Genuardi's.

00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:22.321
Hated the job.

00:14:22.345 --> 00:14:24.238
She's working her way through college.

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:27.904
Her highest strength
was social intelligence.

00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:32.643
So she re-crafted bagging
to make the encounter with her

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:35.438
the social highlight
of every customer's day.

00:14:35.922 --> 00:14:37.638
Now, obviously she failed.

00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:40.976
But what she did was to take
her highest strengths,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.408
and re-craft work to use them
as much as possible.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.348
What you get out of that
is not smiley-ness.

00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:49.275
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:50.703
You don't giggle a lot.

00:14:50.727 --> 00:14:53.313
What you get is more absorption.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.074
So, that's the second path.

00:14:56.098 --> 00:14:58.450
The first path, positive emotion;

00:14:58.474 --> 00:15:01.570
the second path is eudaemonian flow;

00:15:01.594 --> 00:15:03.976
and the third path is meaning.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.976
This is the most venerable
of the happinesses, traditionally.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.499
And meaning, in this view, consists of --

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:14.443
very parallel to eudaemonia --

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:18.030
it consists of knowing
what your highest strengths are,

00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:22.697
and using them to belong to
and in the service of

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.864
something larger than you are.

00:15:26.922 --> 00:15:30.174
I mentioned that for all three
kinds of lives --

00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:34.590
the pleasant life, the good life,
the meaningful life --

00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:36.778
people are now
hard at work on the question:

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:40.729
Are there things that lastingly
change those lives?

00:15:41.768 --> 00:15:44.767
And the answer seems to be yes.

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:47.346
And I'll just give you some samples of it.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.534
It's being done in a rigorous manner.

00:15:49.558 --> 00:15:52.395
It's being done in the same way
that we test drugs

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:54.028
to see what really works.

00:15:54.513 --> 00:15:59.326
So we do random-assignment,
placebo-controlled,

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.197
long-term studies
of different interventions.

00:16:02.221 --> 00:16:06.726
Just to sample the kind of interventions
that we find have an effect:

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.976
when we teach people
about the pleasant life,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.976
how to have more pleasure in your life,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.019
one of your assignments
is to take the mindfulness skills,

00:16:16.043 --> 00:16:18.458
the savoring skills,

00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:21.240
and you're assigned
to design a beautiful day.

00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:27.187
Next Saturday, set a day aside,
design yourself a beautiful day,

00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:31.405
and use savoring and mindfulness
to enhance those pleasures.

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:35.930
And we can show in that way
that the pleasant life is enhanced.

00:16:37.738 --> 00:16:38.962
Gratitude visit.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.739
I want you all to do this
with me now, if you would.

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:45.011
Close your eyes.

00:16:46.812 --> 00:16:51.156
I'd like you to remember someone

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.228
who did something enormously important

00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:57.976
that changed your life
in a good direction,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.933
and who you never properly thanked.

00:17:01.147 --> 00:17:02.636
The person has to be alive.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.163
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.

00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:08.521
I hope all of you have such a person.

00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:12.143
Your assignment, when you're learning
the gratitude visit,

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:15.816
is to write a 300-word
testimonial to that person,

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:18.463
call them on the phone in Phoenix,

00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:21.808
ask if you can visit, don't tell them why.

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.335
Show up at their door,

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:28.296
you read the testimonial --
everyone weeps when this happens.

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:32.481
And what happens is, when we test people

00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:35.624
one week later, a month later,
three months later,

00:17:35.648 --> 00:17:38.306
they're both happier and less depressed.

00:17:39.722 --> 00:17:42.057
Another example is a strengths date,

00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:46.263
in which we get couples to identify
their highest strengths

00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:47.662
on the strengths test,

00:17:47.686 --> 00:17:52.767
and then to design an evening
in which they both use their strengths.

00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:56.284
We find this is a strengthener
of relationships.

00:17:56.788 --> 00:17:58.762
And fun versus philanthropy.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.506
It's so heartening
to be in a group like this,

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.130
in which so many of you have turned
your lives to philanthropy.

00:18:05.154 --> 00:18:08.812
Well, my undergraduates and the people
I work with haven't discovered this,

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:11.644
so we actually have people
do something altruistic

00:18:12.422 --> 00:18:14.086
and do something fun,

00:18:14.197 --> 00:18:15.351
and contrast it.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.976
And what you find
is when you do something fun,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.889
it has a square wave walk set.

00:18:19.913 --> 00:18:23.549
When you do something philanthropic
to help another person,

00:18:23.573 --> 00:18:25.662
it lasts and it lasts.

00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:30.046
So those are examples
of positive interventions.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.096
So the next to last thing
I want to say is:

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.119
we're interested in how much
life satisfaction people have.

00:18:38.143 --> 00:18:40.083
This is really what you're about.

00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:41.976
And that's our target variable.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.976
And we ask the question as a function
of the three different lives,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.216
how much life satisfaction do you get?

00:18:48.747 --> 00:18:51.852
So we ask -- and we've done this
in 15 replications,

00:18:51.876 --> 00:18:54.254
involving thousands of people:

00:18:54.278 --> 00:18:56.773
To what extent does
the pursuit of pleasure,

00:18:56.797 --> 00:18:58.569
the pursuit of positive emotion,

00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:00.317
the pleasant life,

00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:03.749
the pursuit of engagement,
time stopping for you,

00:19:03.773 --> 00:19:07.147
and the pursuit of meaning
contribute to life satisfaction?

00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:10.765
And our results surprised us;
they were backward of what we thought.

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:14.293
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure
has almost no contribution

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:15.976
to life satisfaction.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.529
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.

00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:22.700
The pursuit of engagement
is also very strong.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.634
Where pleasure matters
is if you have both engagement

00:19:27.658 --> 00:19:29.267
and you have meaning,

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:31.580
then pleasure's the whipped
cream and the cherry.

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:38.122
Which is to say, the full life --
the sum is greater than the parts,

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:39.552
if you've got all three.

00:19:39.576 --> 00:19:42.818
Conversely, if you have none
of the three, the empty life,

00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:44.499
the sum is less than the parts.

00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:48.774
And what we're asking now is:
Does the very same relationship --

00:19:48.798 --> 00:19:53.741
physical health, morbidity,
how long you live and productivity --

00:19:53.765 --> 00:19:55.174
follow the same relationship?

00:19:55.198 --> 00:19:57.676
That is, in a corporation,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:03.539
is productivity a function of positive
emotion, engagement and meaning?

00:20:03.563 --> 00:20:06.730
Is health a function
of positive engagement,

00:20:06.754 --> 00:20:09.491
of pleasure, and of meaning in life?

00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:13.730
And there is reason to think the answer
to both of those may well be yes.

00:20:16.204 --> 00:20:20.633
So, Chris said that the last
speaker had a chance

00:20:20.657 --> 00:20:23.078
to try to integrate what he heard,

00:20:23.102 --> 00:20:24.808
and so this was amazing for me.

00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:28.126
I've never been in a gathering like this.

00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:32.525
I've never seen speakers stretch
beyond themselves so much,

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:34.621
which was one of the remarkable things.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.976
But I found that the problems
of psychology seemed to be parallel

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.215
to the problems of technology,
entertainment and design

00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:44.714
in the following way:

00:20:44.738 --> 00:20:48.220
we all know that technology,
entertainment and design

00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:53.244
have been and can be used
for destructive purposes.

00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:58.526
We also know that technology,
entertainment and design

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.069
can be used to relieve misery.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:04.976
And by the way, the distinction
between relieving misery

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.976
and building happiness
is extremely important.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.611
I thought, when I first became
a therapist 30 years ago,

00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:16.976
that if I was good enough
to make someone not depressed,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.048
not anxious, not angry,

00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:22.333
that I'd make them happy.

00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:24.277
And I never found that;

00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:26.323
I found the best you could ever do

00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:27.749
was to get to zero;

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.564
that they were empty.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:35.194
And it turns out the skills of happiness,
the skills of the pleasant life,

00:21:35.218 --> 00:21:37.589
the skills of engagement,
the skills of meaning,

00:21:37.613 --> 00:21:41.764
are different from the skills
of relieving misery.

00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:47.706
And so, the parallel thing holds
with technology, entertainment

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.303
and design, I believe.

00:21:49.327 --> 00:21:56.206
That is, it is possible
for these three drivers of our world

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.445
to increase happiness,

00:21:58.758 --> 00:22:01.646
to increase positive emotion.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.857
And that's typically
how they've been used.

00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.491
But once you fractionate
happiness the way I do --

00:22:06.903 --> 00:22:09.976
not just positive emotion,
that's not nearly enough --

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.133
there's flow in life,
and there's meaning in life.

00:22:13.506 --> 00:22:14.976
As Laura Lee told us,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.668
design and, I believe,
entertainment and technology,

00:22:18.692 --> 00:22:23.423
can be used to increase meaning
engagement in life as well.

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:25.067
So in conclusion,

00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:27.518
the eleventh reason for optimism,

00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:30.717
in addition to the space elevator,

00:22:30.741 --> 00:22:35.872
is that I think with technology,
entertainment and design,

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:39.644
we can actually increase
the amount of tonnage

00:22:39.668 --> 00:22:41.918
of human happiness on the planet.

00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:46.784
And if technology can,
in the next decade or two,

00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:50.672
increase the pleasant life,
the good life and the meaningful life,

00:22:50.696 --> 00:22:52.186
it will be good enough.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:57.815
If entertainment can be diverted
to also increase positive emotion,

00:22:57.967 --> 00:23:01.061
meaning eudaemonia,

00:23:01.085 --> 00:23:02.524
it will be good enough.

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:07.114
And if design can increase
positive emotion,

00:23:08.582 --> 00:23:11.577
eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,

00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:15.140
what we're all doing together
will become good enough.

00:23:15.164 --> 00:23:16.343
Thank you.

00:23:16.367 --> 00:23:22.169
