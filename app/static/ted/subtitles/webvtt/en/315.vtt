WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Who are we?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That is the big question.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
super-intelligent ape.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This could be us.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it's important to remember that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in terms of our place in the world today

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and our future on planet Earth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are one species

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of about five and a half thousand mammalian species

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that exist on planet Earth today.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that have ever lived on the planet in past times.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We're one species out of approximately,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that have existed over the past six to eight million years.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And it's important to remember that,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
because the bonobos are so human,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's important to remember that we evolved.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but we evolved from common ancestors

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We have a common past, and we have a common future.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as we ourselves have today.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and it's this journey that has been the focus

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of the past three generations of my family,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And this is how we look for them.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
out across vast areas of Africa,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I doubt many of you in the audience can see

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the fossil that's in this picture,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to begin to piece together our past.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
When we find a fossil, we mark it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We mark it with a GPS fix,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
so we could essentially put it back on the surface,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
exactly where we found it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
When we then find something very important,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
like the bones of a human ancestor,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And all the sediment is then put through these screens,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and where we go again through it very carefully,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
were digging up some remains of human ancestors.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And it is one of the most special things

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to ever do with your mother.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Laughter)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Not many people can say that.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or runs down to Lake Malawi.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And the Rift Valley is a depression.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
where your bones will be rapidly buried.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
as to bring the bones back up to the surface.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And then you hope that one of us lot

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
will walk around and find small pieces of you.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
(Laughter)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
as we do know today about our ancestors,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because it's incredibly difficult,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
in the very north of our country, Kenya.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of the animals that lived there.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which represents some 20,000 square miles.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
actually lived in this region.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Homo erectus, up in the far right corner,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which I just pulled off the shelf there.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
(Laughter)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
In fact, if you go back in time,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Where did these things come from?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
That's what we're still trying to find answers to,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and it is important to realize that there is diversity

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that have been found from Lake Turkana.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
in search of human remains.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
because I was the same age that he was when he died.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and couldn't get out.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and beautifully preserved.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
walked along a small hillside

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Well, an excavation was begun immediately,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and more and more little bits of skull

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
started to be extracted from the sediment.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And what was so fun about it was this:

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and fairly recently the tree had grown up,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It was truly exciting.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
He had a body very similar to our own,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and he was on the threshold of becoming human.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
started to move northwards out of Africa,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and begin its spread across the globe.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But also, surprising finds

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But they lived only 18,000 years ago,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and that is truly extraordinary to think about.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Just to put this in terms of generations,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
because people do find it hard to think of time,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We evolved essentially from an African stock.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
shared the planet Earth.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The question now is, well, who are we?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And what is it that really makes us us?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I think it's our collective intelligence.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It's our ability to write things down,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
our language and our consciousness.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
has really reached unprecedented levels:

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And we've also managed to communicate with people

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
all over the world, from extraordinary places.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
we can talk to people about what we're doing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we have reached extraordinary numbers

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
of people on this planet.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
if you look at the fossil record,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
for about, on average, a million years at a time.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But what's happened is our technology

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
as anything else that's being done in the world today.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But we have to control our numbers,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because we can't really hold it together as a species.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
My father so appropriately put it,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
that are bad for our survival as a species."

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Can we hold it together?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We all have an African origin.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We have a common past and we share a common future.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and we have the tools and the technology at our hands

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
to communicate what needs to be done

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to hold it together today.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Well, to end on a very positive note,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I think evolutionarily speaking,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Applause)
