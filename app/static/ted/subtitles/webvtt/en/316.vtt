00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in some unconventional ways.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in collecting imaginary stories.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So this is a picture of me

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from reality -- so, real stories.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I'll be talking about each of those today.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I have many of these books,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They accompany me wherever I go in my life,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I fill them with all sorts of things,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
records of my lived experience:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
business cards, writings.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
of moments and experiences and people that I meet.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I started to become very interested in collecting

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
not only my own personal artifacts,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but also the artifacts of other people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, I started collecting found objects.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
about 10 years ago.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Have fun in whatever you do."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And that idea of a partial glimpse is something

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I noticed that it was suddenly possible

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to collect these sorts of personal artifacts,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
all of these things were being expressed by people online,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and leaving behind trails.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, I started to write computer programs

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that study very, very large sets of these online footprints.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
One such project is about a year and a half old.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's called "We Feel Fine."

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it grabs the full sentence up to the period

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and also tries to identify demographic information about the author.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, their gender, their age, their geographic location

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and it's been running for about a year and a half,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is, then, how they're presented.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
feelings from the last few hours,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the diameter of each dot corresponds

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to the length of the sentence inside.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
"I got this on some trading locally,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which consist of the sentence and images being combined.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"I feel good."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but it was worth it."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So the next movement is called mobs.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
These are the images that are automatically constructed.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the kisses felt messy and wrong,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
"I can feel my cancer grow."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
"I feel pretty."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"I feel skinny, but I'm not."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
because I feel the need for speed."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
"I feel sassy."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
"I feel so sexy in this new wig."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
very, very small-scale personal stories.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, really even challenging the notion

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
of what can be considered a story.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
not with the Internet,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So these are some newer projects that

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
actually aren't even launched publicly yet.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the northernmost settlement in the United States,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And that water that you see there is the open lead,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
under the ice, and cuts it up.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So I went up there, and I lived with these guys

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So every five minutes, I took a photograph.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then in moments of high adrenaline,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
like when something exciting was happening,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I would up that photographic frequency to as many as

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
37 photographs in five minutes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That was the first concept here.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The second concept was to use this experience to think about

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the fundamental components of any story.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
What are the things that make up a story?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
They have colors. What do they look like?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
some kind of omniscient, external body

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
through whose eyes you see the story.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
We're very used to this.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and there's all of these overlapping stories

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
intersecting and touching each other.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with an excitement level of high?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in the basement apartment where I was staying.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
These are organized chronologically.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And any of these can be clicked,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and then the narrative is entered at that position.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That's "Moby Dick."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
This is the food we ate.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This is in the Patkotak's family living room

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and the two whales that were killed down here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And now we've whittled down that whole story

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to just 29 matching photographs,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and then we can enter the narrative at that position.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
These whales are about 40 feet long,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
for the community for much of the year.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and an incredibly efficient process.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's baleen. Moving on.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So what I'm going to tell you about next

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
nestled between Tibet and India.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And I was doing a project there about happiness,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
interviewing a lot of local people.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and they've been doing this since the '70s.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And it leads to just a completely different value system.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and took a number of set photographs,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and give them that number of balloons to hold.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and some really sad soul holding one balloon.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And then I would ask them a number of questions like

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And when they made a wish, I would write their wish

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is an 11-year-old student.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and they all had plastic toy guns.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
His wish was to become a police officer.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I took pictures of everybody's hands,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and asked everybody to make a funny face.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
He wanted to help poor people.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and that pile of wheat behind her

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
had taken her about a week to make.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
She wanted to keep farming until she dies.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and she'd found it in the road somewhere.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
A 16-year-old quarry worker.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
which I'm told is very good luck.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
A 16-year-old student.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
She wanted to become an independent woman.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I asked her about that, and she said she meant

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that she doesn't want to be married,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
your chances to live an independent life kind of end,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and so she had no interest in that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
A 24-year-old truck driver.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and he was driving one of these trucks.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Her wish was to marry someone with a car.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
She wanted a change in her life.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and she wanted a different lot on things.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I saw this guy on the side of the road,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and he actually doesn't have a home.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
It was all good-natured.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
A 10-year-old.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
He wanted to join a school and learn to read,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
He was eating this orange, sugary candy

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that he kept dipping his fingers into,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and since there was so much saliva on his hands,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
this orange paste started to form on his palms.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Laughter)

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
A 37-year-old road worker.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
is the use of Indian cheap labor

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
that they import from India to build the roads,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and then they send these people home once the roads are built.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
So these guys were in a worker's gang

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
His wish was to make some money and open a store.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I asked her about her wish, and she said,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
over the years to turn very red.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And she said, "Well, you know,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I asked her a little bit more about the cave

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
What if she saw the truth after just one year,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And this is what she said.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
within one year, or something like that.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
JH: Are you hoping to?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
or to live for one year?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Woman: Thank you.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So thank you again, so much.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Woman: You're most welcome.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So, the last thing we did, very quickly,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
that people have spread out over the years.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and hung them up there among the prayer flags.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And they're actually still flying up there today.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
You can start to see some familiar balloons here.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Thanks very much.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
(Applause)
