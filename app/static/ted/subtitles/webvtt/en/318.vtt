00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(Laughter)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And you're on the outside, you're at home.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You're like the Raspyni Brothers,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where you've got your balls in cold water. And --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Laughter) --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And you want to go back and do it again.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
within the subject of creation and optimism.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And if you put creation and optimism together,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you've got two choices that you can talk about.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You can talk about creationism --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But any kind of conversation about architecture --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
setting up TED, small-scale architecture --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And our own opportunity to make something new there?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
brought architecture into focus

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and made it a subject for common conversation.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a time when five people sat me down at a table

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
safety concerns and whether carpet burns.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
These are just not things we talked about very often.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we're going to think about it like this.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
They've made a selection.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and now to an even larger instrument,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
as you see here.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
after six previous firms struck out

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
with things that were so stupid and banal

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that even the city of New York was forced to go,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Right. Can we do this again from the top,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
except use some people with a vague hint of talent,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Laughter)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's too late. That is gone.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But that's what we're going to do.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But I want you to think about these things

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and that these two things talk about very specifically.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in trying to decide whether we want architecture

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
from the kind of technocratic solution to everything --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
or something that's more of a romantic solution.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So, in the American tradition,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Cartesian grids spreading across the United States,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that gives us basically the whole shape

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of every western state in the United States,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Manifest destiny.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the moment they saw one.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
(Laughter)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Why? Why? Why do you want to do that?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Laughter)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
It's in our nature to go ricocheting

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
back and forth between this technocratic solution

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So we're going to go straight into this.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Can I have the lights off for a moment?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that represent the current split, architecturally,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
between these two traditions of a technocratic

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
or technological solution and a romantic solution.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
One very young, one a little more mature.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is the work of a firm called SHoP,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that takes a picture of the outside world --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
This is just the outline of it, and you can see,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
does it look like a regular building? No.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
square, rectangular, anything like that,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What's interesting about it is not the shape.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
A brand-new way to put buildings together,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's why we all live in developer houses.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
That's because it's cheaper.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
a program that says, manufacture these parts.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
The computer then talks to a machine --

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
because the computer is just a machine.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
so the parts can all be cut at the same time.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
like you used to get when you were a child,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And so what the builder will get is every single individual part

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and that's what will happen in the end.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
these same architects were asked to produce something

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
as part of their young architects summer series.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
In the summer, you go to the beach.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and that computer program shaped a sand dune

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
a set of instructions for pieces of wood.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
What you can see is there's about six different colors,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and there it is fully built.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
There are only 16 different pieces of wood,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
only 16 different assembly parts here.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that very important pedestrian connection

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And they were able to do it. That was their design,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
using that same computer modeling system

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and only five or six really different kinds of parts,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and a very simple framing system

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
They were able to create that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
They were able to create something wonderful.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
using the same technology.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and you get the same kind of grandeur.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
whose work you can see out here today.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
in a very different fashion.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
into something that you can do, into something that will please you,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
something that will lift your spirits,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
something that will make you feel as if are in another world --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
This is happening by itself.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It transforms through the magic of lighting.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
up on the Upper West Side,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Let's see it one more time.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in places that you wouldn't have felt good before.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It's about bringing nature to the inside.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It's about stimulation.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.
