WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Internet, the Web as we know it,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is already less than 5,000 days old.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So all of the things that we've seen come about,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which we couldn't even imagine happening before,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
all these things rolling into our lives,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
just this abundance of things that are right before us,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This kind of cornucopia of stuff

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Laughter)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I know that 10 years ago,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
if I had told you that this was all coming,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you would have said that that's impossible.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And if I told you it was all coming for free,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And yet it's here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we thought it was going to be TV, but better.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was going to be coming.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it turns out that that's not what it was.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so one of the things that I think we're learning --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if you think about, like, Wikipedia,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it's something that was simply impossible.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And if you take all these things that are impossible,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because we're unprepared for it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, I have a kind of a simple story,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that's all these computers, all these handhelds,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
basically what we're getting out of all these connections

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is we're getting one machine.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
are actually just little windows into those machines,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so I began to think about that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And it turned out that this machine happens to be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the most reliable machine that we've ever made.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that runs the number of hours, the number of days.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the Web is only 5,000 days.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What are the dimensions of this machine?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
all around the globe on all the computers.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There's two million emails per second.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So it's a very big number.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's just a huge machine,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So here's the specifications,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
emails running at two megahertz itself,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
31 kilohertz text messaging,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And the total traffic on this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
is running at seven terabytes per second.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So every second, half of the Library of Congress

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
55 trillion links is almost the same

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
as the number of synapses in your brain.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
as the number of neurons in your brain.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So to a first approximation, we have these things --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
twenty petahertz synapse firings.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Of course, the memory is really huge.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So if we say this machine right now that we've made

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is about one HB, one human brain,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
if we look at the rate that this is increasing,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
will exceed a total processing power of humanity,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I have three kind of general things

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I would like to say, three consequences of this.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So let me go through those three things.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
First of all, we have all these things in our hands.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We think they're all separate devices,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but in fact, every screen in the world

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is looking into the one machine.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
These are all basically portals into that one machine.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's wireless. It's always connected.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So the machine is computing.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And in some ways, it's sort of back

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and the sensors in cars

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and everything is connected to this machine.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And everything will go through the Web.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Right now, phones don't go through the Web,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
but they are beginning to, and they will.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
all these things are going to become Web based.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
They're going through the machine.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a Word document, they aren't on the Web,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
They're going to speak the Web language.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
They're going to talk to the machine.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that's sucking up everything into it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And so every thing will be part of the Web.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
some little sliver of Web-ness and connection,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and it will be part of this machine,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and so we have, basically, an Internet of things.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and a car as a chip with wheels,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
A lot of people think about the new economy

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
as something that was going to be a disembodied,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
alternative, virtual existence,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and that we would have the old economy of atoms.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
But in fact, what the new economy really is

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and the digital nature of things into the material world.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And so one of the consequences of that, I believe,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And while there's many differences in some senses,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
they will share more and more in common with each other.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the value's in the uncopiable things,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
The media wants to be liquid.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
not so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And the network effects rule,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
meaning that the more you have, the more you get.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Those are the effects that we're going to see.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Attention is the currency.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And the other thing about this embodiment

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
through all our digital photographs and cameras.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we see that in things like Flickr,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that what the Web is doing is restructuring.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So first of all, the first stage that we've seen

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
of the Internet was that it was going to link computers.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
you connected it from one computer to another computer.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
you had to share packets of information.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you had to share packets.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
so one page links to another page.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And if I want to go in to book a flight,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and I'm linking to that page.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So that's what we were doing.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and that is where we link the data.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So we're going from machine to machine,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
from page to page, and now data to data.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
we're actually going to link from one idea on a page

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
to another idea, rather than to the other page.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So every idea is basically being supported --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So besides physically coming out again into this idea

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So something will resolve down to the information

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Every person, every item will have a something

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that will be very specific, and will link

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to a specific representation of that idea or item.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So now, in this new one, when I link to it,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And so, giving an example of this thing,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and that it's a specific town that I live in,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
but that's what we're going to be talking about.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's going to link directly to --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it will know, the Web will be able to read itself

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and know that that actually is a place,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
it knows that it actually has a place,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
latitude, longitude, a certain population.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that you'll see a lot more of.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So I'll give you one kind of an example.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and all your friends are.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and it should know who all your friends are.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and you should just carry these relationships around.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
All this data about you should just be conveyed,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And you should have all the networks

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
of all the relationships between those pieces of data.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But what's it's doing is sharing data.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And all these things that are going to be on this

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
are not just pages, they are things.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Everything we've described, every artifact or place,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
will be a specific representation,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So we have this database of things.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that that physical thing becomes part of the Web.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And so we are in the middle of this thing

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
that's completely linked, down to every object

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in the little sliver of a connection that it has.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that we're going to be codependent.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And I found out by looking at it

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So I am open, and being transparent to that.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
That is going to be the price.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
If you want to have total personalization,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
you have to be totally transparent.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
where I don't even try to remember things --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
called the alphabet, and writing,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
without this other machine being there.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And what is happening with this is

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
as being an expert, Larry Page told me

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
that that's what they're trying to do,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
and that's what they're trying to do.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But when six billion humans are Googling,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
who's searching who? It goes both ways.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
We are going to be the machine.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
but only better -- it's going to be something different.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And I think it's going to be smarter.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
It will know us, and that's good.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And again, the price of that will be transparency.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And all these devices will be portals into that.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
but a new kind of stage in this development.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
it is a very big machine, very reliable machine,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
more reliable than its parts.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
more as if this wasn't a large organism

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We'll have a better word for it.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
or a volvox, which is what that organism is.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
It's going to be machine-readable.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
You want to make something that the machine can read.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And the One is us. We are in the One.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I appreciate your time.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
(Applause)
