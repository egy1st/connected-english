00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was asked to come here and speak about creation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which I call "creativity."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Creativity is how we cope with creation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
creativity is always meaningful.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
See, for instance, in this picture.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I just did things.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
they followed a straight line that brings me to the point

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Though it's actually true, you know,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
under a climate of political distress,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in a sort of a semiotic black market.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say;

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you had to invent ways of doing it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You didn't trust information very much.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That led me to another step of why I'm here today,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
is because I really liked media of all kinds.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
My first job in Brazil

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was very -- actually, it was a very good study,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and got me a job in an ad agency.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And they also decided that I had to --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And another point -- why I'm here --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I don't know why he had a gun --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
they would only let me do other things.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The first works were actually objects.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I called them relics.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is the clown skull.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
This is the Ashanti joystick.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The rocking podium. (Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The Bonsai table.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I wanted to take that into the realm of images,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I decided to do work with clouds.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Because clouds can mean anything you want.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
so something that would mean at the same time

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
They're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
"The Snail."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But I was still working with sculpture,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
"The Teapot."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And he did something that was very tricky.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
He put together two different media from different periods of time.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And it's totally overkill.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And your eye doesn't know which level to read.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And you become trapped into this kind of representation.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I decided to make these very simple renderings,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that at first they are taken as a line drawing --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It had a physicality,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
"Relaxation."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
"Fiat Lux."

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And the same way the history of representation

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I wanted to deal with other subjects.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I started taking that into the realm of landscape,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,"

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
These always end up being a photograph at the end,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or more like an etching in this case.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So this is a lighthouse.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and I did work and play with them.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I got some photographs from them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Upon my arrival in New York, I decided --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
they were children of sugar plantation workers.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
These are -- (Applause) --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Thank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It was just the name of the child,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
"Valicia."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"Jacynthe."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But another layer of representation was still introduced.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I realized that I could add still another thing

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I was trying to make a subject --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
something that would interfere with the themes,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
so chocolate is very good, because it has --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And so I decided to make these pictures,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And Jackson Pollock also.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
because, you know, you go to that --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
"Paparazzi."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And you render this with the most non-specific material,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
which is dust itself.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This is Richard Serra.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And I realized that I never worked with color,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But once they're applied to numeric structure,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
then you can feel more comfortable.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
They end up being very large pictures,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and I photographed with a very large camera --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
an 8x10 camera.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So you can see the surface of every single swatch --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
like in this picture of Chuck Close.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
which is the bit map.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
This is something I used to do as a joke --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
between the model and the original.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
being 150 meters away.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Now I would do very small ones, which would be like --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but under the same light, and I would show them together,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I was more interested in the things in between,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This is a pipe.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
A hanger.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And this is another thing that I did -- you know working

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I love this work,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that's justified on this thing.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And in this, you'd have like a --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So they're like perfect actors.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,"

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and I went to a warehouse in Queens

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
his name was Joey Grimaldi --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
he impersonated the Moorish general

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
plumber, general, plumber, general --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
See, I think it's not really about impression,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
making people fall for a really perfect illusion,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Because it's not about fooling somebody,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
how much you want to be fooled.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Well, I think that's it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
My time is nearly up.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Thank you very much.
