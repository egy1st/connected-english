00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you'll see a little bit of a relation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It ties to origami. So let me start.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What is origami?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And that is what origami used to be.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But it's become something else.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The common theme -- what makes it origami --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is folding is how we create the form.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It shows these women playing with these toys.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Every Japanese kid

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
learns how to fold that crane.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So this art has been around for hundreds of years,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and you would think something

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And that might have been the case.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But in the twentieth century,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and he created tens of thousands of new designs.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But even more importantly, he created a language,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a way we could communicate,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
a code of dots, dashes and arrows.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we now have a means of transmitting information

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with heredity and selection,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we know where that leads.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And where it has led in origami

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is to things like this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is an origami figure --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This, too, is origami,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Naturalism. Detail.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can get horns, antlers --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
even, if you look close, cloven hooves.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And it raises a question: what changed?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And what changed is something

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you might not have expected in an art,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is math.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That is, people applied mathematical principles

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to the art,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to discover the underlying laws.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that leads to a very powerful tool.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The secret to productivity in so many fields --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and in origami --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is letting dead people do your work for you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
(Laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Because what you can do is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
take your problem,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and use their solutions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Origami revolves around crease patterns.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for an origami figure.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They have to obey four simple laws.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And they're very simple, easy to understand.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
with just two colors without ever having

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the same color meeting.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The directions of the folds at any vertex --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
always differs by two. Two more or two less.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Nothing else.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If you look at the angles around the fold,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
you find that if you number the angles in a circle,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And if you look at how the layers stack,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a sheet can never

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
penetrate a fold.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All of origami comes from that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
give rise to that kind of complexity?"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
can be written down on a napkin,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and yet they govern all of chemistry,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all of life, all of history.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If we obey these laws,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we can do amazing things.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So in origami, to obey these laws,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we can take simple patterns --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and by itself it's nothing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But if we follow the laws of origami,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we can put these patterns into another fold

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that itself might be something very, very simple,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but when we put it together,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
we get something a little different.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This fish, 400 scales --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
you can back off and just do a few things,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on a flag, with 13 stripes.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And if you want to go really crazy,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this guy's on display downstairs,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so take a look if you get a chance.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The most powerful tools in origami

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
have related to how we get parts of creatures.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I can put it in this simple equation.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We take an idea,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And yeah, you really can.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
into a few smaller steps.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So let me stretch out that equation.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I start with my idea. I abstract it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that has a part for every bit of the subject,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
a flap for every leg.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
you can turn it into the finished shape.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now the first step, pretty easy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
going from the abstract description to the folded shape --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that's hard.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
can get us over the hump.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'm going to show you all how to do that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
so you can go out of here and fold something.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But we're going to start small.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This base has a lot of flaps in it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We're going to learn how to make one flap.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
How would you make a single flap?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
until it gets long and narrow,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
What paper went into that flap?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you can see that the upper left corner of that shape

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is the paper that went into the flap.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I can use it for something else.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
There are other dimensions for flaps.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
If I make the flap as skinny as possible,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
There's other ways of making flaps.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, no matter how I make a flap,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
it needs some part

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
of a circular region of paper.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So now we're ready to scale up.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And in the 1990s,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
origami artists discovered these principles

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
just by packing circles.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And here's where the dead people start to help us out,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
because lots of people have studied

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the problem of packing circles.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
looking at disc packings and arrangements.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And it's so simple.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
(Laughter)

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It's so simple that a computer could do it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
in very basic terms, and with this, we could.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And you just draw a stick figure,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and it calculates the crease pattern.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you'll get this crease pattern.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
you'll get a base that you can then shape

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
into a deer,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And if you want a different deer,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you change the packing,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and you can do an elk.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Or you could do a moose.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Or, really, any other kind of deer.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
These techniques revolutionized this art.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We found we could do insects,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
spiders, which are close,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
things with legs, things with legs and wings,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
things with legs and antennae.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
wasn't interesting enough,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
then you could do two praying mantises

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
from a single uncut square.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
She's eating him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I call it "Snack Time."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And you can do more than just insects.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This -- you can put details,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This tree frog has toes.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Toes have become an origami meme,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
because everyone's doing it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You can make multiple subjects.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
The guitar player from a single square,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the bass player from a single square.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that's not so hot.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Do a little more complicated instrument."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, then you could do an organ.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And what this has allowed is the creation

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
of origami-on-demand.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and you can go out and fold it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And sometimes you create high art,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But I want to show you some examples.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Everything you'll see here,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
except the car, is origami.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:33.000
(Video)

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Applause)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Computers made things move,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but these were all real, folded objects that we made.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And we can use this not just for visuals,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Surprisingly, origami

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and the structures that we've developed in origami

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And I want to show you some of these examples.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
One of the earliest was this pattern,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
this folded pattern,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
He studied a folding pattern, and realized

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
this could fold down into an extremely compact package

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that had a very simple opening and closing structure.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And he used it to design this solar array.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
in 1995.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now, there is actually a little origami

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The telescope, going up in space,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
it unfolds in two places.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
you wouldn't even call that origami.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
then you might need some origami.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
had an idea for a telescope much larger.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
They called it the Eyeglass.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The design called for geosynchronous orbit

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
25,000 miles up,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
100-meter diameter lens.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
There were two groups of people who were interested in this:

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
planetary scientists, who want to look up,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and then other people, who wanted to look down.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Whether you look up or look down,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So you have to do something like this.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This was a small model.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But this pattern's not going to work

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So the Livermore engineers,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
wanting to make use of the work of dead people,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
or perhaps live origamists, said,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So they looked into the origami community,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And we developed a pattern together

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
that scales to arbitrarily large size,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
but that allows any flat ring or disc

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And they adopted that for their first generation,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
But this is a five-meter telescope --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
has about a quarter-mile focal length.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it works perfectly on its test range,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Now, there is other origami in space.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and you can see here that the sail expands out,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and you can still see the fold lines.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The problem that's being solved here is

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
but needs to be small for the journey.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And that works whether you're going into space,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
or whether you're just going into a body.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And this example is the latter.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
at Oxford University.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
through your blood vessels.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
based on a model called the water bomb base.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Airbag designers also have the problem

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
of getting flat sheets

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
into a small space.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And they want to do their design by simulation.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So they need to figure out how, in a computer,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to flatten an airbag.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the algorithms that we developed

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
to do insects

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
turned out to be the solution for airbags

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to do their simulation.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And so they can do a simulation like this.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Those are the origami creases forming,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and now you can see the airbag inflate

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and find out, does it work?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And that leads

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
to a really interesting idea.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You know, where did these things come from?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Well, the heart stent

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
came from that little blow-up box

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that you might have learned in elementary school.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The airbag-flattening algorithm

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
came from all the developments

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
of circle packing and the mathematical theory

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that was really developed

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
just to create insects -- things with legs.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
The thing is, that this often happens

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in math and science.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
When you get math involved, problems that you solve

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
for aesthetic value only,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
or to create something beautiful,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
turn around and turn out

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to have an application in the real world.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And as weird and surprising as it may sound,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
origami may someday even save a life.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Thanks.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
(Applause)
