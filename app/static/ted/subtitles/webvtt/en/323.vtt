00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And visiting some pretty incredible places,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was here a month ago.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You see some incredible stuff.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And you get to make these spot comparisons

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
between people all around the globe.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the thing that you really take away from that,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but rather how different we are.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
There is so much diversity around the globe.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
all different colors, shapes, sizes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
How do we explain that diversity?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is how we're using the tools of genetics,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and how long it took.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, the problem of human diversity,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
like all big scientific questions --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
how do you explain something like that --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
can be broken down into sub-questions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
First one is really a question of origins.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
When did we originate as a species?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
How long have we been divergent from each other?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And the second question is related, but slightly different.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If we do spring from a common source,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and in the process generate all of this diversity,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the different ways of life, the different appearances,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the different languages around the world?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
"In each great region of the world, the living mammals

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and as these two species are now man's nearest allies,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
lived on the African continent than elsewhere."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
our common ancestry with apes.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
became the gibbons and the orangutans.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And the ones that stayed on in Africa

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But that's not really the question I'm asking.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm asking about our human ancestry,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
things that we would recognize as being like us

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
if they were sitting here in the room.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If they were peering over your shoulder,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Because if we go far enough back,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
How do we study that?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Digging things up out of the ground,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and largely on the basis of morphology --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This must be who I'm directly descended from."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
What do I mean by that?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You're looking at a great example here.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
These are three extinct species of hominids,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
potential human ancestors.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
again, largely skull shape.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to categorize every living organism on the planet.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You think you've got a tough job?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And he did a pretty good job.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
which basically included all the people he didn't like,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
including imaginary folk like elves.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
working in the pre-Darwinian era.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
basically that same classification of humanity.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Carlton Coon is the best example --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But based on what data?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Well, what I'm going to talk about today,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and saying it on the basis of morphology --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which we still don't completely understand,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
or a genealogical question.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And as any genealogist will tell you --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You gradually trace further and further back into the past,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
adding these ever more distant relationships.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Who were these people who came before?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
we have a historical document that takes us back in time

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Now, a quick primer on DNA.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And the whole thing, if you add it all together,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is over six billion nucleotides long.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
thousands of times. It's a lot of information.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now multiply it by 100.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And imagine copying that by hand.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And you're working away until late at night,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and you're paying attention, but, occasionally,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
when you're copying this by hand,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
through the generations, they become markers of descent.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
If you share a marker with someone,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the person who first had that change in their DNA.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the pattern of these markers in people all over the world,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
all the way back to the very first woman.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
traces a purely paternal line of descent.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What's the take-home message?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is that the deepest lineages in our family trees

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
are found within Africa, among Africans.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
That means that Africans have been accumulating

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
this mutational diversity for longer.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But what's even more amazing

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
only lived around 60,000 years ago.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
That's only about 2,000 human generations,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
This was an African man who gave rise

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's only within the last 60,000 years

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Such an amazing story.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
or sub-species rather, human races around the world?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the ones that are tough to answer.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Lots of evidence from sediment cores

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and there aren't a lot of glaciers here,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
except on the high mountains here in East Africa.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
This is a paleo-climatological map

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So the whole world was drying out.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
compared to what we have today.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The evidence from genetic data

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And then something happened. A great illustration of it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Look at some stone tools.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
not our direct ancestors, living in Europe,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
or physical anthropologists in the audience,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
The tool styles don't change that much.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
The evidence is that the human way of life

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
didn't change that much during that period.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
at particular times of the year.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The population size started to expand.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Probably, according to what many linguists believe,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
around 60, 70 thousand years ago --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
These would have been savannah hunters.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And it's basically a meat locker.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
People who would have specialized in killing the animals,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
because that's what they were adapted to live on.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And when they reached Central Asia,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
a grassland super-highway.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and the entire continent was open to them.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and finally, a small group migrating up

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
The changes that allowed us to do that,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
allowing us to create novel cultures,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
allowing us to develop the diversity

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And as we were finishing up that film --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
it was co-produced with National Geographic --

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"You know, we really see this as kind of

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and we want to take it to the next level.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
What do you want to do next?"

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
you know, a handful of populations around the world.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
The project launched in April 2005.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
retain a connection to the place where they live

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
that many of the rest of us have lost.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That's the focus of the field research,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
the centers that we've set up all over the world --

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
10 of them, top population geneticists.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
In this case, you actually can.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And you can actually submit those results to the database,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
and tell us a little about your genealogical background,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
gets plowed back into the project.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
and I'll show you a couple of examples.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
collected from indigenous people around the world.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
210,000 people have ordered these participation kits

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
since we launched two years ago,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
which has raised around five million dollars,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So the project is going very, very well,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
(Applause)
