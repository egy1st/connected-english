00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is an icon of National Geographic,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with a parody of National Geographic,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He mounted a camera on the tail.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I love this photograph because it reminds me

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
they're not very good swimmers --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we know what's happening to the ice.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
photographed by Chris Johns.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a great portraitist.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
photographed by Nick Nichols.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
happening on the dance floor.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But, hey, at least it's hygienic.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by David Doubilet.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
photographed by Emory Kristof.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Photography carries a power that holds up

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
because photographs emulate the way

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that our mind freezes a significant moment.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Here's an example.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and he was learning how to swim

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I can stand here right now and see,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
as I go tearing into the water after him,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I can see the rocks are over here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There's a wave about to crash onto him.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I can see his hands reaching out,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and I can see his face in terror,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I got him. The wave broke over us.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We got back on shore; he was fine.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We were a little bit rattled.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is when all the elements came together to define

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And this is what a photograph taps into

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now I have to tell you,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I was talking to Kyle last week about this,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that I was going to tell this story.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I remember my image of you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Laughter)

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I thought I was a hero.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
this represents -- this is a cross-sample of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
working at the very top of their craft --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
except one.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in New Zealand last year,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And it has become a wild success,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
tapping into the enthusiast photography community.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The quality of these amateur photographs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
can, at times, be amazing.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And seeing this reinforces, for me,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that every one of us has at least one or two

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
great photographs in them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But to be a great photojournalist,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
you have to have more than just one or two

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
great photographs in you.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You've got to be able to make them all the time.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But even more importantly,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
you need to know how to create a visual narrative.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You need to know how to tell a story.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So I'm going to share with you some coverages

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in Chad, called Zakouma.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The original intent was to travel there

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and bring back a classic story of diverse species,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of an exotic locale.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And that is what Nick did, up to a point.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This is a serval cat.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
He's actually taking his own picture,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
shot with what's called a camera trap.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
There's an infrared beam that's going across,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
These are baboons at a watering hole.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
took thousands of pictures of this.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
of the rear ends of baboons.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(Laughter)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
A lion having a late night snack --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
notice he's got a broken tooth.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I love this little bit of water

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that comes off the back of his tail.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
something that digital photography has made a big difference for.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
collared the matriarch of the herd.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
They named her Annie,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and they began tracking her movements.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The herd was safe within the confines of the park,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because of this dedicated group of park rangers.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But once the annual rains began,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And that's when they ran into trouble.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
For outside the safety of the park were poachers,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The matriarch that they were radio tracking,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
came to a halt outside the park.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And they only came for the ivory.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This is actually one of the rangers.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
because they couldn't leave it there,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
because it's still valuable.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But what Nick did was he brought back

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
a story that went beyond the old-school method

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Instead of just knowledge of this park,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
he created an understanding and an empathy

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Now let's go over to India.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
touches upon in his new world population project.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
For the first time in history,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And most of that growth is not in the cities,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but in the slums that surround them.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
came to me and said,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So instead, what we did was

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in what we'd consider sort of a survey story --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
we put Jonas into Dharavi,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
which is part of Mumbai, India,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and let him stay there, and really get into

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
at the awful conditions that exist in such places.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
of how the entire urban area functioned.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
By staying tightly focused in one place,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that underlies this community.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And he did it in a beautiful way.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and photojournalist Randy Olson

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
but the photographs that Brian and Randy created

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are among the best to capture both the human

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and natural devastation of overfishing.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Here, in a photo by Brian,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
a seemingly crucified shark is caught up

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in a gill net off of Baja.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the animals accidentally scooped up

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
while fishing for a specific species.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
But here, Brian captured a unique view

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
by positioning himself underneath the boat

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
when they threw the waste overboard.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And Brian then went on to even greater risk

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to get this never-before-made photograph

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Back on land, Randy Olson photographed

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
a makeshift fish market in Africa,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the main parts having already been sent to Europe.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
As prime food sources are depleted,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
the harvest goes deeper into the oceans

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and brings in more such sources of protein.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
This is called fishing down the food chain.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But there are also glimmers of hope,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
we don't really want to go

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and just look at all the problems.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We also want to look for solutions.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
where commercial fishing had been banned --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the result being that the overfished species have been restored,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Photography can also compel us to confront

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
took a look at the sweep of the medical system

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and exits back home, on the other.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Jim started in the battlefield.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Here is in the field hospital.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
From here, the more severely wounded are transported

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
back to Germany, where they meet up with their families

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
for the first time.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
such as here in Walter Reed.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
they exit the medical system and attempt

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to regain their pre-war lives.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, these stories are great examples

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of how photography can be used

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to address some of our most important topics.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
But there are also times when photographers

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
just plain fun.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to shoot a story on leopard seals.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
about getting into the water.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You know of "The March of the Penguins."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
This is sort of the munch of the penguins.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
(Laughter)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
to see if the coast is clear.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But then Paul got in the water.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And he said he was never really afraid of this.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Well, this one female came up to him.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
but she's 12 feet long.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So, she is pretty significant in size.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And Paul said he was never really afraid,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
because she was more curious about him than threatened.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
This mouthing behavior, on the right,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
(Laughter)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
that for some reason didn't seem to be interested

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
in chasing penguins.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
alive, and put them in front of him.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Go back and get them, and then bring them back

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and drop them in front of him.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And she did this over the course of a couple of days,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
until the point where she got so frustrated with him

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that she started putting them directly on top of his head.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
(Laughter)

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
(Laughter)

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
that he was never going to survive.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is her just puffing out, you know,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
snorting out in disgust.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
(Laughter)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Paul set out to photograph a relatively

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
mysterious and unknown creature,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and came back with not just a collection of photographs,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but an amazing experience and a great story.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It is these kinds of stories,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and can be employed as a positive agent

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
for understanding the challenges and opportunities

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
facing our world today.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Thank you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
(Applause)
