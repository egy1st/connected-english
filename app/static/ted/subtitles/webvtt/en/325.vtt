00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But apparently he was a very nice dog

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
♫ I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then ♫

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
♫ I was no longer alone. ♫

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ singing my song, strolling along." ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
♫ 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout. ♫

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about, ♫

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ that's what it's all about, ♫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW ♫

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ that's what it's all about. ♫

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Good dog!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Thank you.
