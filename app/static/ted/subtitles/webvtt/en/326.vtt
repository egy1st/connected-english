00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and how they interact on the most fundamental level.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to study things on the smallest scale.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But more recently, I've been turning my attention

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to the universe on the largest scale.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Because, as I'll explain to you,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
at least some of the big questions.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, recently, we have realized

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that the ordinary matter in the universe --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the planets, the stars, the galaxies --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of the content of the universe.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is what we use to detect things.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We know it's there by its gravitational effects.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In fact, this dark matter dominates

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What about the rest of the pie?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
More about that later, OK.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
than those that are further out here, OK.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from the center of the galaxy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
When those measurements are made,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
as a function of distance.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
they tend to cluster.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So all of these galaxies are moving.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But that cannot account for the mass either.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in the form of this invisible or dark matter

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to try to remind you that it's there.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And so let me lead you through how we can do this.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So here's an observer:

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
How do we see that galaxy?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for perhaps billions of years

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
before it enters the telescope or your eye.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
as it enters our eye, right?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We say, the ray of light came this way;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the galaxy must be there, OK.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and don't forget the dark matter, OK.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we now need to take into account

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
will deflect not only the trajectory of particles,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but will deflect light itself.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Where will this observer see the galaxy?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You can respond. Up, right?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Is there any other ray of light

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Yes, great. I see people going down like this.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So a ray of light could go down, be bent

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
up into the observer's eye,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and the observer sees a ray of light here.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, take into account the fact that we live in

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
a three-dimensional universe, OK,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
a three-dimensional space.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that will all be bent by that cluster

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and make it into the observer's eye.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to figure out what that image will look like.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We call this gravitational lensing.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And so, this is your instrument, OK.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
(Laughter).

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
But ignore the top part.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And now put the lens over the galaxy,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now, move the base off to the side,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And you can put it on top of any image.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
On the graph paper, you can see

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And again, this is a kind of an accurate model

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
of what happens with the gravitational lensing.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And the answer is yes.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Many of the images you are seeing

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
those are the galaxies in the cluster.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that are causing the bending of the light

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of the background galaxies.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
there must be in this cluster.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And it's an enormous amount of mass.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They are centered on some more spread out structure,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and that is the dark matter

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
in which the cluster is embedded, OK.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So the evidence that we have

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that a quarter of the universe is dark matter --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
this gravitationally attracting stuff --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it must be embedded in dark matter.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
If you could do this, what you would find

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that with each passing day, each passing year,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
each passing billions of years, OK,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
the distance between galaxies is getting greater.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And it's not because galaxies are moving

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
away from each other through space.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They're not necessarily moving through space.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
They're moving away from each other

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
because space itself is getting bigger, OK.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So they're moving further apart.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But because gravitationally attracting matter

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
is embedded in this space,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So the expansion slows down with time.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So, in the last century, OK, people debated

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
about whether this expansion of space would continue forever;

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
whether it would slow down, you know,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
will be slowing down, but continue forever;

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
slow down and stop, asymptotically stop;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So a little over a decade ago,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
two groups of physicists and astronomers

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
set out to measure the rate at which

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
By how much less is it expanding today,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
was that space is expanding at a faster rate today

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
than it was a few billion years ago, OK.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
This was a completely surprising result.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It was the opposite of what was expected.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So we need something to be able to explain that.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Now it turns out, in the mathematics,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
you can put it in as a term that's an energy,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but it's a completely different type of energy

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
from anything we've ever seen before.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We call it dark energy,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and it has this effect of causing space to expand.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But we don't have a good motivation

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
for putting it in there at this point, OK.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
are completely different things, OK.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and they have very different effects.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
because of all this gravitational attraction.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Dark energy, on the other hand,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
is putting more and more space between the galaxies,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and so it impedes the growth of structure.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and how they -- their number density,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
how many there are as a function of time --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
compete against each other in structure forming.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that were actually introduced

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
things that I haven't even talked about,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that each predict the existence

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
of a very weakly interacting, new particle.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, this is exactly what you want in physics:

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that was actually developed for something else.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But we don't know if either of those

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Now, we look for these dark matter particles

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because, after all, they are here in the room, OK,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and they didn't come in the door.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
They just pass through anything.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
They can come through the building, through the Earth --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
they're so non-interacting.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So one way to look for them is to build detectors

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
have built such a detector.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
announced the most sensitive results so far.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that we'll be turning on later this year.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, because they are so non-interactive,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
they will actually escape the detector,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
so their signature will be missing energy, OK.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
whose signature could be missing energy,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
so it will be hard to tell the difference.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that are in competition right now

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So in terms of the big questions:

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
what is dark matter? What is dark energy?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
The big questions facing physics.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And I'm sure you have lots of questions,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
which I very much look forward to addressing

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
(Applause)
