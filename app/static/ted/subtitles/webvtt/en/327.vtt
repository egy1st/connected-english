00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My favorite topic is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
shortcuts.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But I will demonstrate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
different ways to get

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
rid of difficulties and go to the point,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to find an answer

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
probably much quicker than Arthur did. So,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
first,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we violate the common sense,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
90 degrees --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
all of you. Not you.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All of you, right? Palm up.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you do this,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you agree?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Good.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But I will first teach you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a method, how you can do it without

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
moving the wrist, and then the shortcut.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You can do it immediately, right?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hold the hand like this, palm up.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't move the wrist. The wrist is --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Right-molded you say, with iron?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That was a joke, actually,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and I --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
OK.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Forward, don't move the wrist.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And forward. Yeah.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
logic, logically,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, the shortcut.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
(Laughter)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But it was six moves. Now with one move.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I start here, palm down, you can follow.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And then look at me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah! (Laughter)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
One move. OK.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that was the warming up.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I need an assistant.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
She has left. No! A big hand.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
(Applause)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Good. Nice. And you can sit over there.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
One item here was water, right?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I will give my tribute

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to water.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about -- cheers.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Laughter)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Beer has about --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
there's a lot of water in beer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So, now

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I will demonstrate different ways of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
memorizing,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
control cards and so on.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I think I'll take off this one.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I work with a special

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
method to do it, quick.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I work with

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
precision -- oh, sorry --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
control

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a very powerful ...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
memory system, right?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
if --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I have studied the poker. I like to gamble.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Officially, I don't gamble but ...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, if we are --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
if we have five person,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and I will do a five-handed poker game.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now I will interact. So a different person

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
all the time, so not the same person can answer.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So we have an agreement.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Which one shall have a good poker hand?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Lennart Green: Three -- good.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
here,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I had a mat here to make it a little --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the critical moment is -- sorry.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
If a card shark gathers the cards together,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
immediately when he --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
before he deals the card. Now,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so I think, number three,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I have arranged them in a full house.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
With queens and -- it's OK --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
queens and tens.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
That's a challenge. I like this.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I start with three queens.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And two tens.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Yeah. Thank you.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Applause)

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So these guys have actually a stronger hand --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
three aces and two kings.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
This guy beats them with

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
four of a kind, or deuce -- deuce.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
No reaction? That with even --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
OK, and this.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
These look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and ...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But, of course, I will have the winning hand.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Ten, jack,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
queen, king, ace.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yeah. So,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
good.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So the hand that looks so good from the beginning,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
number three, at the end

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
was actually the lowest hand.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Such life. Right?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So, please mix them.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
underground techniques.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Yes?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I work with

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
kind of estimation,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
shuffle tracking --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
ah, good.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Impressive. Thank you.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
(Laughter)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, first,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the first term is estimation.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
are put between

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
my royal flush.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Right? You agree.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So here I have, actually --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I know exactly where the cards are.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So here, I can make a bet,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So here: 10, jack,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
queen, king, ace.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
OK.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Applause)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Next

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is a term --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I do it quick. I call this stealing.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So here, I think

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I know about where the cards are.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Zoe: Stop.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
LG: Here -- you see some are missing?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And that's the stealing cards, which I did.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
OK.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Now, another term called shuffle tracking.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
even if another person shuffles.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is a little risky.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You agree? But if you square --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
square, and shuffle,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then a cut.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So here,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Come to -- no, no, no, no.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I'm joking, yeah?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Any style -- yeah, good.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I work direct with the right brain.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If you pass the left brain,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
you have to take care of logic and common sense.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
(Laughter) --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Arthur Benjamin did

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
a little of the same thing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you have -- that's the password

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
to the

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
cosmic bank of knowledge,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
where you can find any solution of any problem.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
OK. Now, I drop the cards,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and you say stop anyway, right?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Not at the last card.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
(Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Ah, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
No, I'm kidding.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Applause)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
No, now and then I put in a mistake,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
just to emphasize how difficult it is.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But now I'm glad I remember it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
this deck is bought here. Sorry.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I have a little pad

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to make it a little softer.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
This deck is bought here in America.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It's called

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
but not so many people know,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
if you check, if you press at

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the right spots,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Now, you can carry this in your wallet,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
so ...

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
You don't see it, make no reaction?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So, but here,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is the camera getting too much? No.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But not too much.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Then you have to push it down again.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Here, please. If you push these

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
heaps -- everyone see --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
push them together so they are really interlaced,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
right? Yeah, good.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Perfect.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Just push them through, good. Thank you.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And then, I will demonstrate a thing from

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Russian satellite,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
stealen -- stolen,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
probably copied from America but we will see.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Here --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Now I go very quick

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
through the deck and try to find some pattern.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
The new chaos theory is already old, right?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But you know, I think you are

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
familiar with fractals --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And it's much

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
easier to memorize cards in a pattern way,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
then you go to --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in another language ...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yeah, great.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I think I have it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So now, different persons, older, tap.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Please name any card, anyone.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Jack of spades.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
nine, 10, 11,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
12. Yes, right.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So -- oh, jack of spades.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So, jack of spades.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I think ...

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
23 --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
24, sorry, 24.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
23 --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ah, 25, yes.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It's the last.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now, I do it quicker, better.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
(Laughter)

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
-- actually, my technique is to peek,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
all the time.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
When I lift the heap, I peek.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You see, yeah, perfect.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate -- yeah, good.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So I will do it quick,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Laughter)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Good, thank you.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
(Applause)

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
The thing I did -- I peeked.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I know where the card were,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
then I chose it. So another person, another card.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Laughter)

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Another person.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
LG: Pardon?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I think I do it the same way. I like to,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
so I know where it is.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Ten of diamonds.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But now I do it the regular speed, right?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Ten of diamonds.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Good.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Maybe you will cut? Lift.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Excellent.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, thank you. Another person, another card.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
(Audience: Five of clubs.)

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Five of clubs.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
(Laughter)

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We do it again.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
The person who said five of clubs say stop,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
when the cards are in the air, right?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Audience: Stop.)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
LG: Very good.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
OK.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Applause)

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
OK, I had to use a little force there.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I think we save five of clubs.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Excellent. I love that card.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Here, I will do the most difficult thing.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and you're betting,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and you let the other guys

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And now, when I lift this card,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
it shall be your card. What was your card?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
(Audience: Queen of hearts.)

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So that's a tough challenge, right?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So here, I grab --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
you know this? Five of clubs ...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and queen of hearts. Yes!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
This is a tough one,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
because here I must take advantage of --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I switch it with the five of clubs.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So, now

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
a false count.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Which card shall I use? Queen or five?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
The false count -- and the number

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
one, two, three,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
four, five, six, seven, eight --

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
you say the same card all the time.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Eight, nine, 10.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
This is a kind of optical deal, right?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
When I put one card at a table --

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
look, it's not one card. It's -- look,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
it's a bunch of cards that gives this

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
impression.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yeah.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Now some hard stuff.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I think we keep the queen here, yes.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Now, to the satellites things.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
This --

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
(Laughter)

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
This is high-frequency laser,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and it's enough with a fraction of a second

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
to destroy the retina completely.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Right, sorry, my -- I should have mentioned that, yeah.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But you can relax,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
because it takes half an hour before it works,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
(Laughter)

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Now,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I put the laser here,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and --

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
now, when I deal the cards in the laser,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I know where they are but -- yes?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Did the camera got it?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
No?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They didn't?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
What happened?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
(Audience: It disappeared.)

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
LG: OK, I'll take another group.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Do the cameras see the cards now?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
LG: But you see the hand.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Ah, good, good, good. But now.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So now, that was the reason, right?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
You see the cards? Yes.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
(Laughter)

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Yeah, good.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Now --

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
(Laughter)

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
-- one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
(Laughter)

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah, interesting,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
but a little dangerous.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
(Laughter)

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I liked it. Now,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
a little more difficult.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Name -- anyone, name, please, any suit.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So here,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
here I have to peek, lots of cards.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I think there are lots of --

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
(Laughter)

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Then I arrange them so I can

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
get them quick.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Perfect, excellent.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
So I start with the ace --

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
yeah, ace. Ah, yeah -- spades?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Same mistake as before, right?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You see, I don't work with prestige,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
so always do mistakes.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
It doesn't matter to me.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
One,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
two, three, four -- yes,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
the camera got it? Five, six,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
seven, eight --

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
ah --

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
nine, 10,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the jack,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
jack of spades,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
queen of --

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
(Laughter)

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Wait, wait, wait -- please take any card.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Grab any one. Quick, quick, good.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And we switch this to the king.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Ace of diamonds.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
So I find ...

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
king of spades.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Yeah? OK.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
(Applause)

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Now, a little more difficult thing.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
so you help me to shuffle again.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Another suit, please.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.)

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
(Laughter)

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
LG: It was after the blindfold.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I like this guy, yeah.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
OK. That should be my end effect, but OK.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Armani -- who said Armani? You?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
I drop the cards and you -- which size?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Which size?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Say stop. (Audience: Stop.)

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
(Laughter)

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
LG: Yeah, Armani. OK.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:12.000
(Applause)

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Ah, this is tough.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
So, in this case,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I try to

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We try. Yeah. You help me.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
If I drop the card face up,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
LG: OK, now.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
(Laughter)

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So here,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Stop. Do you see the pattern?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
No? Now?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yes, yes, OK.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I work with pattern.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Oh sorry, I dropped one.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Maybe it's important --

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
yeah --

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
nine of diamonds, OK.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So now --

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I always ask,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
why do I put myself in this position?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I have to figure out so many outs,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
when I miss some cards, but

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I love it. So now,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I will do it. I will try to find

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
the diamonds,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
but I will do it the hard way.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
It's too easy to do it right away, right?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
I think I will do it ...

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
blindfolded.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
At this distance, it works immediately.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Aargh!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:10.000
(Laughter)

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Duct tape.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I look -- shake the cards, so I don't.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Empathy.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
But it was -- did you hear?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
(Laughter)

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Yeah, good. Yeah.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
You can take the nostril too, because some guys think --

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
(Laughter)

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
-- some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
more. Go, go.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Right? Good.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Satisfied?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
(Laughter)

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
No, with dignity and elegance, right?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And it was OK. One more?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
The last.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
OK.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
All right.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Now you must agree that I'm --

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I must rely on other senses, right?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I work with vibration.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
what was the card?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
So now I have

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
to improvise again.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Diamonds -- I'll start with ace of diamonds.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Just kidding, warming up -- king of hearts.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
(Laughter)

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And I give you a diamonds, so they -- so you put them here,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
LG: Good. Good. Two -- (Applause) --

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
thank you.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I never ever miss two. This is interesting.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Always I've found two,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
but the wrong color. Spades, sorry.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And the deck is a gift to you after,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
so let the skepticals here, in this,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Two -- and it was two of spades, right?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Three --

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
three of diamonds. Yes!

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Four --

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
I like challenges, yes.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah, good.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Chris Anderson: You're peeking.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
LG: Pardon?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
CA: You're peeking. You just got to --

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
this is a request from the lady in the back.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:02.000
(Laughter)

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Okay.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Try that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
LG: Yeah. Also listen.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
OK, now.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
This is maybe a little tough.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
We will try.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yes? Good?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
(Laughter)

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
OK. So,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
LG: Four. Is five the next card?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
LG: Oh.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
So here,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
all the cards are face down --

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
you agree? (Audience: Yes.)

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
LG: Yes? You see that in the screen?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
So next card will be -- was it five?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah --

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I will reverse it face up here.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Yes? Zoe: Yeah.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
LG: Six -- six with the thumb.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Seven.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Yeah, I do this. I know where it is,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
because I peeked before and then I do this.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Right?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Eight.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
If --

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
and then nine, right?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Yeah.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Yesterday -- the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
and I used this actually.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Nine? Yeah? Correct?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Ten --

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Yeah. Jack -- you [unclear] with Jack?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Jack

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
of

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
LG: Yes?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
queen! Queen, with misdirection.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Misdirection. (Applause)

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Yeah?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And then,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
king, after exactly

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
five seconds.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Yeah. Five. Five seconds.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
One,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
two, three, four -- mmm!

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Check it.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yes?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah!

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Good. Oh.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Touch me, feel --

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
ah, ah, you know!

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you.
