00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Dogs have interests.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a difficult choice, right?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Rear end, owner. Rear end wins.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I mean, you lose.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You cannot compete with the environment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if you have an adolescent dog's brain.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the dog's point of view.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, I'm here largely because

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
number one, by making up rules, human rules.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We don't take the dog's point of view into account.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And then number three, now we can punish the dog

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you know, isn't that nice?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, this whole dominance issue -- number one,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of a very complicated social system.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they take this stuff seriously.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because it prevents physical fights.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The number one is, "I have it, you don't."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Dogs get so abused.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Dogs, horses and humans --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
these are the three species which are so abused in life.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And the reason is built into their behavior --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is to always come back and apologize.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They are just so beatable,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and that's why they get beaten.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because he grew?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is insanity.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I said, "Let's teach him to sit."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And then we give him a reason for sitting.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Because the first stage

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is basically teaching a dog ESL.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Go on, something should happen now.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Well, I've got news for you.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
English as a second language.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And that's how we use the food lure in the hand,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and we use food because we're dealing with owners.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
much better than I am.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I don't need food, but the average owner says,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"Puppy, sit."

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You know, "Sit, sit."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Then we phase out the food as a lure,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and you can actually communicate to a dog

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
in a perfectly constructed English sentence.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and the name of my son, "Jamie."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And the dog can take a note,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and take him a little message that says,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Will it do it?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Not necessarily, no.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why come to the owner?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We use the Premack principle.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
one the dog doesn't want to do --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Sit," sniff butt.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So now all of these distractions that worked against training

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
now become rewards that work for training.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And I can imagine this dog, you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They're like Golden Retrievers.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
they will throw tennis balls,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
they will cook for me and serve the food.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Then I have my own personal doorman,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And now the dog's really happy.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And this, to me, is always what training is.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So we really motivate the dog to want to do it,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Now we move to phase three, when now --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
there's times, you know, when daddy knows best.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And there's times, for example,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
if my son's friends leave the door open,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is a life-or-death thing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You leave this, the sanctity of your house,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and you could be hit on the street.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So some things we have to let the dog know,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"You mustn't do this."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And so we have to enforce, but without force.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
They think a punishment is something nasty.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I bet a lot of you do, right?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It doesn't have to be.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There's several definitions of what a punishment is,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but one definition, the most popular, is:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
such that it's less likely to occur in the future.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and they never took it outside.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The dog is actually euthanized now,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but this was a dog I worked with for a while.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
When the dog would try to leave the mat,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
she would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because we had a lot of aggression related towards food.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The breaks got fewer and fewer.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You see, the punishment was working.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The behavior problem was going away.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
She never raised her voice.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
If she did, she would have got bitten.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's not a good dog you shout at.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This is crazy.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, where do we go from here?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We want a better way.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Dogs deserve better.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It has to do with watching people train puppies,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
horrendous relationship skills.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The dog says, "I don't think so."

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Laughter)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I mean, who in their right mind

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
would think that a dog would want to approach them

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
when they're screaming like that?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Instead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I was walking onto a plane --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and it really cemented what I wanted to do

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
with this whole puppy-training thing,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You know, I puppy-train my child.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
kicking the back of the chair.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
"Johnny, don't do that."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Kick, kick, kick.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm standing right here with my bag.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And ugly face is this --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
That child has lost everything --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that one of the two people he can trust in this world

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I walked to the back of the plane,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I sat down, and a thought came to me.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And this is what it's all about.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
These relationship skills are so easy.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
You know, kind of like a little robot.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And then, a little behavior problem comes up.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
No different from the dog barking.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The husband won't clear up his clothes,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it then starts, and we get into this thing,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
especially with children, especially with parents.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You see it especially in the workplace,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
especially from boss to employee.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
It's as if there's some schadenfreude there,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It really is.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You know, calculus is wonderful.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
these are cool things.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And my look to the future is,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Your kids are easy to train.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
All you've got to do is to watch them,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That is such a powerful training technique.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This should be taught in schools.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Relationships -- how do you negotiate?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
How on earth about raising children?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
which are just as hard to break as bad habits.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So, that would be my wish to the future.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
(Applause)
