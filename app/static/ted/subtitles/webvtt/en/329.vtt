00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And we crave one thing,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
even though we kind of don't know it all the time.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We crave to be in the room with the musician

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the day it was recorded, the day it was played.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And it turns out the further back you go in history,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the little rougher it sounds.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so we said, there's a solution to this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's separate the performance, as a thing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
out from the recording, which was how it was made.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and what instruments they were using.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it's the data hidden inside the recording.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that runs in a very high resolution.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that looks like a nice grand piano there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have a process where we, you know,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we look at every single note,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and all the attributes of those notes:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and how you move the fingers.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm going to start with Glenn Gould.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He just got tired of being in front of an audience,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
His maybe most famous recording

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
was something called "The Goldberg Variations."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He wrote some early pieces,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but late in his life, in his mature period,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
one in mono, and one in stereo.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and we'll play the first couple pieces of it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Glenn Gould, 1955.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Music)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
How about that?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
(Applause)

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So let me tell you a little bit how this was done.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
First of all, let me get you to the end step.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is -- we have a fairly complex process

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that, you know, software and musicians and so on,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
actually of an instrument just like that one,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and I'm going to play them together at the same time.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
(Music)

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Music)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Before "Jurassic Park,"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, in the video world,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And this is kind of another example

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of putting a science behind natural behavior.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then you heard the original.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Ultimately, I started with the experience.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's so involving compared to regular stereo.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And so on the same disk we have five recordings --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Sony has five recordings.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And you could listen in headphones

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
with this thing called binaural recording.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and it's got microphones where the ears are.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and moving through the whole process.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's a game changer.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Here's now something we know in spectacular quality.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
What you heard today was not perfect.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and steel strings, and all these,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So when you go into the recording session,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and the dummy head and our recording engineers

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
standing around while we rebuild the piano.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Without putting dates next to these things,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
step-by-step music will be turned into data,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Audio has come very late to this game --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
which is how it was performed.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and you can't trick them very easily.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
All right, there's this episode of "Star Trek."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
(Laughter)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
remember this one?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And at some point he's dancing with his --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Right, do you know where I'm going?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And then Spock turns round, he goes,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and I don't believe this is one of them in the category."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That's where I'm at.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's now coming in this world.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The transition will be this one.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I believe this is coming.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
no Glenn Gould in the room.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But yet, it was human.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Every time you listen to a recording today,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
every time you take out your iPod and whatever,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You want to hear it played by different musicians.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's so amazing, it's so exciting.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's a way better experience

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So I've really overshot my budget here.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We made a new recording of him

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I've got to tell you, we have this lab

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and we flew out to Los Angeles.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And as the president of the company,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
That's a real uncomfortable feeling,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And we captured all that data all over again.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I want you to hear that right now.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And fortunately, it's right in here.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This is an encore he used to do.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's one minute long.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(Music)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
(Applause)

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And that's just what the live audience did.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
(Applause)

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.
