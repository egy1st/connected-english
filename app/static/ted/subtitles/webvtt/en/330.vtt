WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So what's image got do with it?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a lot of subliminal messages,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that have come up.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But I'm going to try and do something different,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we've been talking about.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as you can see.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We're not the only ones.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Applause)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And you know, it's amazing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I mean, we need a whole conference

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Just think about that, you know?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this is typically what we've been talking about,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the role that the media plays in focusing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
just on the negative stuff.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, why is that a problem?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
A typical disaster story:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
disease, corruption, poverty.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And some of you might be standing here thinking,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and all you privileged people come here, saying,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
'Forget the poor people.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
who really need help."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We start with poverty.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or being able to support family.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
When things were bad, we had porridge.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And like many African families,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
my parents could never save

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and things were always dicey.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which was free.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And they adopted a very interesting

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
approach to education, which was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And what happened was,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I got kicked out pretty much every term.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You know, someone would come in with a list

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of the people who haven't paid school fees,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and when they started getting pretty strict,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I remember thinking, I mean,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Because you know, as a kid

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
you're embarrassed and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
you're sensitive, and everyone knows

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
you guys don't have money.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But they kept at it,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I now understand why they did what they did.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They talk about corruption.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and provincial schools.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a national school.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I missed the cutoff by one point.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And my father said, "OK, listen.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You know, it's just one point. I mean,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So we went to the school,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and because my father didn't have the right last name,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
he was treated like dirt.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you know, who do you think you are?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And, you know, you must be joking if you think

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
you can get a slot.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and who had done much, much worse than I did,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and they had slots there.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
being humiliated in front of you, you know?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And we left, and I swore to myself,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to beg for anything in my life."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They called me two weeks later, they're like,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Disease.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
He never told anyone that he had AIDS,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
his fear of the stigma was so strong.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And I was in the States at the time,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Because of doctor-patient privilege,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
read about the disease,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I pretty much realized what was going on.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The first time he got sick, he recovered.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But what happened was that he had to be on medication

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You know, so money ran out.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
He got sick again.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and he used to import, bring him, could

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
get him a generic version of it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And that kept him going.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But the money ran out.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
for him to start the treatment until Monday.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And finally, we figured, well, OK,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
At least he'll get treated

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
while we try to figure out the money situation.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And he died when the ambulance was coming

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to the hospital to take him.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
imagine if this is all you know about me.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
How would you look at me?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
With pity, you know. Sadness.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And this is how you look at Africa.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
This is the damage it causes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You don't see the other side of me.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You don't see the blogger,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the vibrant person, you know?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I just wanted to personalize that.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Because we talk about it in big terms,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and you wonder, you know, so what?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But it's damaging.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I'm not unique, right?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Imagine if all you knew about William

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And I was just moved.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I was actually crying during his presentation.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
He was like, I try and I make.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
(Laughter)

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
When you focus just on the disasters --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:50.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
-- we're ignoring the potential.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, what is to be done?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
First of all,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We heard about that yesterday.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We had some of them this morning.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And this is an example, you know,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
blogging is one way of doing that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that was developed in South Africa.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So we need to start getting better.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And going back to the point I was trying to make,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
this is the Swahili Wikipedia.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It only has five contributors.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
He's the only African who's contributing to this.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
People, please. We can't whine and complain

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the West is doing this.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
What are we doing?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Why are we not generating our own content?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Reuters now integrates African blogs

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
into their coverage of Africa.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So, that's a start,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and we've heard of all their other initiatives.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The cheetah generation.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And after all the hoopla of Live 8,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
we're still not anywhere in the picture.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
No, you're not.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:35.000
(Laughter)

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But the point I'm trying to make, though,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And for those of you in the diaspora

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
who are struggling with where should I be,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
should I move back,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
should I stay?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You know, just jump.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The continent needs you.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Covington and Burling, six figures.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
With two paychecks, or three paychecks,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And because I'm needed here, you know?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I probably can win a prize for the most ways

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to use a Harvard Law School degree

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
because of all the things I'm doing.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
One is because I'm pretty aggressive,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and I try and find, you know, opportunities.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But there is such a need, you know?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
for an organization called Enablis

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We're now moving into East Africa.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And we give them business development services,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
as well as financing loan and equity.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I've also set up a project in Kenya,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and what we do is we track the performance

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of Kenyan MPs.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Everything else on there is a labor of love.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We've manually entered all the data there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And you can get profiles of each MP,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
questions they've asked in parliament.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We have a comment function,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
where people can ask their MPs questions.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
There are some MPs who participate,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and come back and ask.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And basically, we started this because we were tired

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of complaining about our politicians.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You're not just going to be accountable

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
out of the goodness of your heart.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What are they doing?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You know, they're not going to change

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
just out of nowhere.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So we need new policies, we need --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
where's that coming from, you know?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Another thing is that these leaders

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
are a reflection of our society.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We talk about African governments

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
They come from us.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And how can we change that?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Where do we go from here?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I believe in the power of ideas.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
because it can make a difference.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The other thing I want to urge you to do

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is take an interest in the individual.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I've had lots of conversations about things I think

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
need to be happening in Africa.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
"BBut it's not scalable, you know.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Give me something I can do with Paypal."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's not that easy, you know?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
because usually the individual in Africa

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
carries a lot of people behind them.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I was helping her pay her tuition.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I was paying her school fees.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
You know, she's now my baby sister.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I am able to lift all those people.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So, don't underestimate that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
An example. This man changed my life.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
because he took an interest.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
this is an overeager student,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
which we don't normally get in the United States,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
because everyone else is cynical and jaded.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
He called me to his office and said,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And he was like, "Why? You know,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we don't need another lawyer in the United States."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And he tried to talk me out of it,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I'm poli-sci Ph.D.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
what I need to do to help you out."

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And to me at that time university --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and that was like heaven, OK,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
you have all these things going for you."

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
for applying to law school.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
you're that good, OK?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And he built me up, you know?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And this is just an illustration.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You can meet other individuals here.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We just need a push.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
of us having to leave the continent

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
so that we can fulfill our potential.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You know, my vision is that my daughter,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and any other African child being born today,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
can be whoever they want to be here,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
without having to leave.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And they can have the possibility of transcending

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the circumstances under which they were born.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and you can move.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that doesn't define who you are.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and the circumstances under which you were born,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
determine the rest of your life.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I would like to see that change,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and the change starts with us.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Thank you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(Applause)
