WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we don't understand as much as we think we do.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'd like to begin with four questions.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's an in-joke, by the way.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But these four questions, actually,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of audiences of science educators --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So the first question, and you might want to write this down,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
right? Where does all this stuff come from?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Knocks)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if you had to do it? Or would you just say,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that's actually not possible?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but why? And finally, would you be able to --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and you can sort of scribble it, if you like --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
showing the shape of the planets' orbits?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Would you be able to do that?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And if you can, just scribble a pattern.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
from experience of the world around them,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
from all the things that go on between them and their peers,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm not quite sure how he died, actually.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you haven't been conferring, and so on.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but maybe not in this instance.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But, actually, we don't do that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The mass of this comes out of the air.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I passed them really well, but I still came out of school

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, I have some rather bad news,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
go to MIT on graduation day.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
from here, and you wouldn't mind too much,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but it sort of works the same way in Britain

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and in the West Coast of the USA.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And so, there's a whole lot of people saying,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because of British-like hubris.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And when we gave graduate engineers that question,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
they said it couldn't be done.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And there are also some societal reasons

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That's what plants actually do for a living.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
if we don't understand that kind of thing.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
if you've only seen a circuit diagram,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and it happens pretty early on.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
must be because we're closer to the Sun."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I promise you that most of you will have got that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Oh, you're all shaking your heads,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
we're further from the Sun in summer,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
If you believe, as most of you probably do,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
you must have drawn an ellipse.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Right? That would explain it, right?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and we've got winter, and what --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I hope you notice the coincidence here.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
caused by our experiences as children?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to show that it's not really like that?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's a plan, looking down from above.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
from websites, educational websites --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and almost anything you pick up is like that.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to have a load of concentric circles,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
if you've got that misconception in your head, then that

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
where all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And I know that if the graduates at MIT

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
they would have learned how it actually works,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So good interpretation is more about

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of a piece of glass or machined titanium,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and it all looks fantastic, OK?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So, children are not empty vessels, OK?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So, as "Monty Python" would have it,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but this is -- children are not empty vessels.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
They come with their own ideas and their own theories,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
of how the world and universe operates, either.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
of the whole population into digital technology [for television].

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And it's one of the difficult things

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
it's quite difficult to shift those.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
as children persist into adulthood.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And we collude. We design tests,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
OK? We collude, and actually if you --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
if someone had designed a test for me

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
when I was doing my biology exams,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to really understand, to see whether I'd understood

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and seeing it go blue,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
then I might have done better at science.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Your homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And the second question to that then is,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
(Laughter)

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I've always wanted to say that in this country.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
(Laughter)

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
it's just part of learning that's important.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Applause)
