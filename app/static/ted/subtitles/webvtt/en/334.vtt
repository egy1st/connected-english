WEBVTT

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.382
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her 
introduce herself to everybody.

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:04.460
Can you tell everybody your name?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.550
Einstein: Einstein.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.300
SW: This is Einstein. 
Can you tell everyone "hi"?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.572
E: Hello.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.679
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.470
E: Hi, sweetheart.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.750
SW: Much better.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.110
Well, Einstein is very honored 
to be here at TED 2006,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.000
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.460
In fact, she's very excited.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.240
E: Woo.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.000
SW: Yeah.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Since we've arrived, 
there's been a constant buzz

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.770
about all the exciting speakers here 
for the conference.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.640
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers
about Tom O'Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.000
Einstein, did you hear whispers?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
E: [Squawks]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
SW: Yeah.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Einstein's especially interested 
in Penelope's talk.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.971
A lot of her research goes on in case, 
which can get pretty dusty.

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:44.000
E: Achoo!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.560
SW: It could make her sneeze.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.950
But more importantly, 
her research could help Einstein

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.671
find a cure for her 
never-ending scratchy throat.

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:51.790
Einstein: [Coughs]

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.000
SW: Yeah.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.770
(Laughter)

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.700
Well, Bob Russell was telling us 
about his work on nanotubes

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.990
in his research at the microscopic level.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, that's really cool, 
but what Einstein's really hoping

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.430
is that maybe he'll genetically engineer 
a five-pound peanut.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.000
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.385
SW: Yeah. She would get 
really, really excited.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:10.550
(Laughter)

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.080
That is one big peanut.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.770
Since Einstein is a bird,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.210
she's very interested in things that fly.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.000
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.600
E: Ooh.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.836
SW: Yeah. She especially likes 
his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.350
Einstein, would you like to ride 
in Burt's spaceship?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.220
E: [Spaceship noise]

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.900
SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.000
E: [Laser noise]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Laughter)

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.659
SW: Yeah, yeah. 
That was pretty funny, Einstein.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.550
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.730
working in caves 
and travelling through space --

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.548
it's all very dangerous jobs.

00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:47.000
It would be very dangerous 
if you fell down.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.690
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.640
SW: Yeah.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.970
Little splat at the end there. 
Einstein, did that hurt?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.780
E: Ow, ow, ow.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.890
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.850
E: [Squawks]

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.261
SW: Yeah. It can get a bird 
like Einstein frustrated.

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:01.000
E: [Squawks]

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.460
SW: Yeah, it sure can.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.507
But when Einstein needs to relax 
from her job educating the public

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:07.000
she loves to take in the arts.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.640
If the children of the Uganda 
need another dance partner,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.850
Einstein could sure fit the bill, 
because she loves to dance.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.000
Can you get down?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.470
SW: Let's get down for everybody. 
Come on now.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.000
She's going to make me 
do it, too. Ooh, ooh.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
SW: Do your head now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.873
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.860
SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like 
to learn some arias on her violin,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.000
and Einstein can sing along 
with some opera?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
E: [Operatic squawk]

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
SW: Very good.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Or maybe Stu just needs 
another backup singer?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Einstein, can you also sing?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I know, you need to get rid 
of that seed first. Can you sing?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
E: La, la.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
SW: There you go.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.660
And, of course, if all else fails,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.000
she can just run off 
and enjoy a fun fiesta.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
E: [Squawks]

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.490
SW: All right.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.050
Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed 
to admit this earlier,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.910
but she was telling me backstage 
that she had a problem.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.860
E: What's the matter?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.411
SW: No, I don't have a problem. 
You have the problem, remember?

00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.517
You were saying 
that you were really embarrassed,

00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:09.520
because you're in love with a pirate?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.510
E: Yar.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.670
SW: There we go. And what do
pirates like to drink?

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.560
E: Beer.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.638
SW: Yeah, that's right.

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:17.490
But you don't like to drink beer, 
Einstein.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.700
You like to drink water.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.800
E: [Water sound]

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.590
SW: Very good. Now, really,
she is pretty nervous.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.580
Because one of her favorite folks 
from back home is here,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.320
and she's pretty nervous to meet him.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.970
She thinks Al Gore 
is a really good-looking man.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.350
What do you say to a good-looking man?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.350
E: Hey, baby.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.000
(Laughter)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.634
SW: And so do all the folks 
back home in Tennessee.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.000
E: Yee haw.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
SW: And since she's such a big fan,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.500
she knows that his birthday 
is coming up at the end of March.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.310
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.000
so Einstein wanted to do 
something special for him.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So let's see if Einstein will sing 
"Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.606
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:57.900
SW: Again.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.630
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.570
SW: Again.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.000
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
SW: Big finish.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
SW: Good job!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Applause)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.450
Well, before we wrap it up, 
she would like to give a shout out

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.000
to all our animal friends 
back at the Knoxville Zoo.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.421
Einstein, do you want 
to say "hi" to all the owls?

00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.410
E: Woo, woo, woo.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.000
SW: What about the other birds?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
SW: And the penguin?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.820
E: Quack, quack, quack.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.000
SW: There we go.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.280
Let's get that one out of there. 
How about a chimpanzee?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.000
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
SW: Very good.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What about a wolf?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.730
E: Ooooowww.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.650
SW: And a pig?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.000
E: Oink, oink, oink.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
SW: And the rooster?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.550
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.370
SW: And how about those cats?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.160
E: Meow.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.000
(Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.495
SW: At the zoo we have 
big cats from the jungle.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:49.433
E: Grrrrr.

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:50.910
(Laughter)

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.500
SW: What about a skunk?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
E: Stinker.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.550
(Laughter)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.100
SW: She's a comedian. I suppose 
you think you're famous? Are you famous?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.000
E: Superstar.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.200
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.560
Well, we would like 
to encourage all of you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.680
to do your part to help protect 
Einstein's animal friends,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.860
and to do your part to help protect 
their homes that they live [in].

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.700
Now, Einstein does say it best 
when we ask her.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.270
Why do we want to protect your home?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.000
E: I'm special.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
SW: You are very special.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.720
What would you like to say
to all these nice people?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.080
E: I love you.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.480
SW: That's good. 
Can you blow them a kiss?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.000
E: [Kissing noise]

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.480
SW: And what do you say 
when it's time to go?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.750
E: Goodbye.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.240
SW: Good job. Thank you all.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.000
(Applause)
