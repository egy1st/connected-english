00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My mission in life since I was a kid was,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and is, to take the rest of you into space.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In fact, I think it is a moral imperative

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we open the space frontier.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to have planetary redundancy,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And if you think about space,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
everything we hold of value on this planet --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We are on the verge of the greatest exploration

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that the human race has ever known.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We explore for three reasons,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the weakest of which is curiosity.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Some images from Mars, 1997.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
under the soils and different parts of that planet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and while the probability is very small,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
the impact, figured in literally,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that to spend a small fraction looking, searching,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And of course, the third motivator,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
there's a class of the nickel iron,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which in platinum-group metal markets alone

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
are worth something like 20 trillion dollars,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to go and be part of this amazing mission.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we knew nothing about going to space.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to going to the moon in eight years,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They didn't know what couldn't be done.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They had to make up everything.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
we should be allowed to risk.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and clearly the industrial-military complex --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The ability for us to access these resources

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to gain planetary redundancy --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you know, everything stored on our databases,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and back them up off the planet,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the moon, to Mars. And today,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter) --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
concentrated in the hands of few individuals

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and the technology accessible

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that will allow us to really drive space exploration.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but how cheap could it get?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Let's go back to high school physics here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
anybody here fast in math?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I'll grant you that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But guys, if history has taught us anything,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I have no question that the physics,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the engineering to get us down to the point

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of their own money in R&amp;D.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It's all government research dollars, and very few of those.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And in fact, the large corporations,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the governments, can't take the risk.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
12 to 15 launches per year.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and I call them self-loading carbon payloads.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They come with their own money. They're easy to make.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
carry three people up to 100 kilometers,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
spending between one to 25 million dollars each.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
which made those two flights and won the competition.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
for just a quick video.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Richard Searfoss: Good luck.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
(Applause)

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
(Applause)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of the Ansari X PRIZE competition,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
(Applause)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Well, people are going to die,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
how can you possibly going to put this forward?"

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and said, "Are you going to compete?" No.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I took a bet that someone would win.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Applause)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We've had a lot of accomplishments

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and it's been a tremendous success.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is going to hang in Air and Space Museum,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Isn't that great? (Applause)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Today, you can go and experience weightless flights.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is going to be about 200,000.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I know if they don't do it, I am --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
we're going to stockpile some fuel,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
(Laughter)

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Quick moment for the designers in the audience.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
people think a zero gravity room,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
there's a switch on there that turns it off --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
If we can get the audio up?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When you want the taste that won't weigh you down,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the only way to go is up.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We're based down in Florida.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and we just took on a new mission statement:

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and other technologies for the benefit of humanity."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And this is something that we're very excited about.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And you know, when you give to a nonprofit,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
you might have 50 cents on the dollar.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And that's huge. And then he turned around and said,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I said, "Well, that's great."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
into a world-class prize institute.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
This is what happens when you put up a prize,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
You get publicity increase, and when it's won,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And the benefit to the sponsors

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
That's our value proposition in a prize.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
or any kind of a new technology,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
you have to fund that from the beginning

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and you pay on success.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
tried to go across the Atlantic,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So, prizes work great.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
you know that when you're going for a goal,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the first thing you have to do is believe

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that you can do it yourself.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
of -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And then you have to convince others,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
what we've experienced a prize doing,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Well, it must be a good idea.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And each of these areas was something that we found

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
of how to come up with prizes and write the rules,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and we're actually looking at creating prizes

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in a number of different categories.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and I'll talk about those more in a moment.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're going after an orbital prize.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We are looking at a number of energy prizes.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Craig Venter has just joined our board

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
we'll be announcing later this fall,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
it isn't money, it's only one thing --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
it's the committed, passionate human mind.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Applause)
