WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and today I'd like to talk about their relationship.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themes

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of this conference or the entertainment industry,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or why the invention of the atomic bomb

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And it's not just what these are doing to each other,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
To get a sense of this,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's been a theme we've talked about all week,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and what's not, and then tell me why.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of the discussion on television.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Video) Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Peter Hirshberg: Which is more fun, Internet or TV?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Girls: Internet.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Girl 2: I think we -- the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Girl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
PH: Would you like to be the president of a TV network?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Girl 4: I wouldn't like it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Girl 2: That would be so stressful.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Girl 5: No.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
PH: How come?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Girl 5: Because they're going to lose all their money eventually.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Girl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I think right now the computers will be at the top

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and everything will be kind of going down and stuff.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
PH: There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We go through periods of enthrallment,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
followed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
best characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Let me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the first interactive cable TV system,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the New York Times heralds this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as telecommunications moving to the home,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
convergence, great things are happening.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I had a happy brush with convergence

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
on kind of entertainment and technology

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But they were onto something and they got better at it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to their balance sheet.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
(Laughter)

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is that tech folks talk differently.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
about total transformation.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you know, who else talks that way?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And the answer is pretty clearly --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
it's people in religion and in politics.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
not as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We promise something great, we evangelize it,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal tool

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of media and entertainment, how did we get here?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and artillery morph into media?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Of course, the first computer was built just after World War II

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to solve military problems, but things got really interesting

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
just a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
a machine that might actually be a potential media star.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the computer begins to express itself.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
With considerable trepidation,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
we undertake to interview this new machine.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Jay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Would you like if I used the machine?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Journalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Since this computer was made

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
give Whirlwind the workout?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and see how it can determine, at any instant,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and the velocity at that set instant.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
JF: Over on the left-hand side,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And on the right-hand side, there's a scale

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that shows the rocket's velocity.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that we're now looking at.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
How's that?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Journalist: What about that, Admiral?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
CB: Looks very good to me.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
JF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Journalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and all of this would have been lost

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
if it weren't for a happy coincidence.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Enter the atomic bomb.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and knowing a good thing when it sees it,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
deploy it all across the frozen north,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and spend nearly three times as much on this computer

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
as was spent on the Manhattan Project

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
building the A-Bomb in the first place.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Here's their marketing video.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
before we could determine their tracks.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And then it would be too late to act.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We cannot afford to take that chance.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to strengthen our air defenses.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
involved in countering a mass enemy raid.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It is provided with its own powerhouse

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
containing large diesel-driven generators,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
PH: You know, that one computer was huge.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
There's an interesting marketing lesson from it,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
which is basically, when you market a product,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you can either say, this is going to be wonderful,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
it will make you feel better and enliven you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is a really good example of that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This had the first pointing device. It was distributed,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
so all these things could talk to each other.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
at this conference, so let's talk about making things large.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And then, the 92 nuclear power plants

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that it would take to provide the power

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
would fill up the rest of Los Angeles.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and the reasons these transformations are happening.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
All of this stuff starts moving into industry.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
DEC knew a good thing about wasting time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It shipped every one of its computers with that game.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Meanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
has been busted completely.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In fact, despair is in the air.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
from everything I've been reading all week.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Every effort has been made and will continue to be made

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
to find a new pattern, new selling arrangements

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but I don't know how."

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And they fake it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
up on the set, you just get them out.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and your erasing glove,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
You all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Come on into the secret lab.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
PH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
"Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
why do I have to buy theirs?"

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I assure you, that's not the case.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
would go on to be perfected with great success

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It led to lawsuits --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
(Laughter) --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
federal investigations, and lots of repercussions,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and that's a scandal we won't discuss today.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of "Winky Dink,"

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
went on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Charles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
ending Berry's career.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It turns out there was a lot to learn

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
about how this new medium worked.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like this

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and were trying to understand the media,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Professor Marshall McLuhan.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
He actually understood something about a theme

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in an era of pervasive electronic communications.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Here he is talking from the 1960s.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
(Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
They were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They were horrified when they discovered

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
on the part of the programmers.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
PH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
If you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
it is very true that his understanding is probably

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
(Video) MM: The global village is a world

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in which you don't necessarily have harmony.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You have extreme concern with everybody else's business

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and much involvement in everybody else's life.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And so the global village is as big as a planet,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and as small as a village post office.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
PH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We're now right into the 1960s.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But all that was about to change.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You know, the expression of technology

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
to America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
had to do with computing? Everything.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
In the midst of revolution in the streets

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and rock and roll concerts in the parks,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
but while he was beginning to do his work,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and other areas around the campus,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and there was music literally in the streets.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
People were leaving to go back to the land.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
There was women's liberation.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
This was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And into that ferment came the microprocessor.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
by these communities that they were trying to build.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I think these ideas are difficult to understand,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
because when you're trapped in one paradigm,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
The title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
The title was taken from the lyrics

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
"Remember what the dormouse said.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
PH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
in Cambridge and Silicon Valley.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Here's the Architecture Machine Group,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
HyperCard was the first program

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
to introduce the public to hyperlinks,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
or piece of text, or data across a file system,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and we had no way of explaining it.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
There was no metaphor. Was it a database?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
A prototyping tool? A scripted language?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
We asked a question about how the mind works,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
A few years later, we then hit on the idea

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the way you want it and the easy way?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Here's the Apple marketing video.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
(Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several ways

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
to create a HyperCard interactive video.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
The most involved method is to go ahead

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and produce your own videodisc

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
as well as build your own HyperCard stacks.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
The method we illustrate in this video

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
in ways which suit your specific needs and interests.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
That's like a Dick Cheney speech.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
on the content business. Find the commercial stuff,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
mash it up, tell the story your way.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Now, as long as we confine this to the education market,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and a personal matter between the computer and the file system,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
that's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and a lot of other people.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
It became a killer app of links, and today, of course,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
we call that the World Wide Web.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
but a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
The year is 1993

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
and he was working on a book and I was working on a video

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
We were plenty aware that we were messing with media,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
the Digital Superhighway.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and making big bucks on advertising,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
David Sarnoff commercializes radio.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Narrator: The medium introduced America to new products.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Voice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and greater ease of use for the whole family.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Narrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Narrator: Eventually, the race to the future took on added momentum

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
with the breakup of the telephone company.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And further stimulus came

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
with the deregulation of the cable television industry,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
The world and all its culture reduced to bits,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
the lingua franca of all media.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And the forces of convergence exploded.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Finally, four great industrial sectors combined.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Telecommunications, entertainment, computing and everything else.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Man 3: We'll see channels for the gourmet

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
and we'll see channels for the pet lover.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Voice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Narrator: All of industry was in play, as investors flocked to place their bets.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
At stake: the battle for you, the consumer,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:09.000
and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music)

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Thomas Edison had the same problem.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and kind of only one of his ideas

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
turned out to have been the right early idea.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Well, you know where we're going on from here.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and I don't need to tell you about that

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
because we all went through that bubble together.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
things actually are quite different.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
If Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
It's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
(Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
PH: In my own company, Technorati,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
That's about 2,700 fresh, connective links

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
across about 112 million blogs that are out there.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
You know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
that a producer is anyone who knows a writer.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
"Websites attract striking writers:

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
could benefit from labor disputes."

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Meanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
in sympathy with the television writers.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
which is about to sponsor the online video awards --

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
not appearing to gloat.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
To show you how schizophrenic this all is,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
being asked, well, with the writers' strike,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
(Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
there's an opportunity for more people to experience

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
video on places like MySpace TV.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
PH: Oh, but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
(Video) Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporation

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
as part of Fox Entertainment Group.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Obviously, we hope that the strike is --

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
PH: One of the great things that's going on here is

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
the globalization of content really is happening.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Here is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
that was written by a writer in Hollywood,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
animation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and it's now an international series.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
(Video) Narrator: The following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m.,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
in the months preceding the presidential primaries.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Voice 1: You'll have to stay here in the safe house

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
until we get word the terrorist threat is over.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Voice 2: You mean we'll have to live here, together?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Voices 2, 3 and 4: With her?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Voice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
PH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting example

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
They're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
What the entertainment business is struggling with,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
the world of brands is figuring out.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
For example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
it's a network to hook its customers together.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our site

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them."

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Which means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Or, as Nike's head of marketing says,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
We're in the business of connecting with consumers."

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And media companies realize the audience is important also.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page --

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
user-generated content married up with traditional content.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
in the age of the blogosphere.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
One of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and --

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
about where songwriting's going.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Ally Willis: Where millions of collaborators wanted the song,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
because to look at them strictly as spam

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
is missing what this medium is about.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
PH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
who, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
that were going through just as much change,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
and I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
But I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
(Video) Narrator: We are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
MM: The medium does things to people

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
and they are always completely unaware of this.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
They think of the old medium,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
because the old medium is always the content of the new medium,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
as movies tend to be the content of TV,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
and as books used to be the content,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
novels used to be the content of movies.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And so every time a new medium arrives,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
is done by the new medium, and it is ignored.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
PH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
There's been more raw DNA of communications and media

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
that are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And whereas television may have gotten beat up,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
and we kind of have the merger of the two industries

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
and a new way of thinking to look at it.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Thanks very much.
