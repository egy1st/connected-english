00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A fact

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
came out of MIT,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
couple of years ago. Ken Hale,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who's a linguist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
said that of the 6,000 languages

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
spoken on Earth right now,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
3,000 aren't spoken by the children.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So that in one generation,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we're going to halve our cultural diversity.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He went on to say

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that every two weeks,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
an elder goes to the grave

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
carrying the last spoken word

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of that culture.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So an entire philosophy,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a body of knowledge about the natural world

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
goes away.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And this happens every two weeks.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So for the last 20 years,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
since my dental experience,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I have been traveling the world

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and coming back

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with stories about some of these people.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What I'd like to do right now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is share some of those stories with you.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is Tamdin.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
She is a 69-year-old nun.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for putting up a little tiny placard

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
protesting the occupation of her country.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And when I met her, she had just

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
taken a walk over the Himalayas

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
into Nepal, across to India --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
30 days --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So I took this picture three days

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
after she arrived,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with her toes sticking out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And she crossed in March,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is Paldin.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And he spent 33 years in prison.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
His whole monastery was thrown into prison

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
at the time of the uprising,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
when the Dalai Lama had to leave

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Tibet.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
he was beaten, starved,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And it really impressed me --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that he went through that experience, and ended up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
with the demeanor that he had.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and I'd spent about five weeks there,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and I was hearing these similar stories

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
into Dharamsala.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And it just so happened, on the fifth week,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
many of which I had just interviewed,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and heard their stories,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I watched their faces,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and they gave us a little FM radio,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And what he said was:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because it's your enemies

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that build your tolerance and patience

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
on the road to your enlightenment.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That hit me so hard,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
telling these people that had been through this experience.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, two months later, I went into

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Tibet, and I started

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I interview and do portraits.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And this is a little girl.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I'd snuck in --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it's the quickest way you can get arrested.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and I would hand them out.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And when I gave them to the people,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
they'd either hold them to their heart,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And this is --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
way in the western part of the country.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This is at 17,000 feet.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And they had just come down from the high pastures,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
at 18,000 feet.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Same thing: gave her a picture,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
she held it up to her forehead.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And I usually hand out Polaroids

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and checking my lights,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is Tenzin Gyatso;

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
out in a peasant's house,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
way out in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
At the age of four, he was installed

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
as the 14th Dalai Lama.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
As a teenager, he faced

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the invasion of his country,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to kill him,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
they dressed him up like a beggar

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and snuck him out of the country on horseback,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and took the same trip that Tamdin did.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And he's never been back to his country since.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
if you think about this man,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
46 years later,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
still sticking

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to this non-violent response

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to a severe political and human rights issue.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And the young people,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
You know, violence as a political tool

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
is all the rage right now.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
he still is holding this line.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So this is our icon

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to non-violence in our world --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
one of our living icons.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This is another leader of his people.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And Moi is 35 years old.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
oil was discovered in 1972.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And in this period of time -- since that time --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
as much oil, or twice as much oil

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And Moi

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
belongs to the Huaorani tribe,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and they're known as

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
very fierce, they're known as "auca."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And they've managed to keep out

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the seismologists and the oil workers

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
with spears and blowguns.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And we spent --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I was with a team --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
two weeks with these guys out in the jungle

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
watching them hunt.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This was on a monkey hunt,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
hunting with curare-tipped darts.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And the knowledge that these people have

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
about the natural environment is incredible.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And I couldn't even see the monkeys

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that they were

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
getting with these darts.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is Yadira,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and Yadira is

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
five years old. She's in a

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And her tribe has had to move

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And we never hear about that. And the latest

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
infraction against these people is,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
as part of Plan Colombia,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we're defoliating thousands of acres

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
of the Ecuadorian Amazon

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in our war on drugs.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This is Mengatoue.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
He's the shaman of the Huaorani,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of spearing these oil workers.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I wish they would just go away.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I was -- I usually travel alone

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
when I do my work, but I did this --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I hosted a program for Discovery,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and when I went down with the team,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I was quite concerned about

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
deep into the Huaorani tribe.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
as it turned out, these guys really

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
taught me a thing or two about blending in

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
with the locals.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Laughter)

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
One of the things I did

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
just before 9/11 --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
August of 2001 --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I took my son, Dax,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
who was 16 at the time,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and I took him to Pakistan.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Because at first I wanted --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but I wanted him to see

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
people that live on a dollar a day or less.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I wanted him to get an experience

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
in the Islamic world

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and I also wanted him to --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I was going there to work with a group,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
do a story on a group called the Kalash,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that live -- very small area --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
drumming and dancing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And he brought a soccer ball,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and we had soccer every night in this little village.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then we went up

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and met their shaman.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
of his tribe as well.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And this is John Doolikahn,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
who's the shaman of the Kalash.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And he's up in the mountains,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
right on the border with Afghanistan.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the area where

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And we watched

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and stayed with

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
John Doolikahn.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
which is

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
an interesting phenomenon.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
But around the world,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
they go into trance in different ways,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and in Pakistan,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and they sacrifice an animal,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
pour the blood of the animal on the leaves

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and then inhale the smoke.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And they're all praying

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to the mountain gods

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
as they go into trance.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You know,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
getting kids used to different realities,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
having a curriculum where they study different religions,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
just to make a mental flexibility,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
give them a mental flexibility

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
in different belief systems --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I think this is so necessary in our world today

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And all the security issues they cause us.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, one thing we did five years ago:

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
we started a program that links kids

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So we first hooked up

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
We now have 15 sites.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and one-third animist, the community is --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Ollantaytambo, Peru,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and Arctic Village, Alaska.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
This is Daniel; he's one of our students

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in Arctic Village, Alaska.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
He lives in this log cabin --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
no running water, no heat other than --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
no windows

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and high-speed Internet connection.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And this is --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I see this rolling out all over --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
where they first saw their first computers;

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
now they have computers in their classrooms.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And the way we've done this --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
we teach digital storytelling to these kids.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
in their community that they care about.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
about a river that they cleaned up.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and we bring people who want to learn

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
digital workflow and storytelling,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and have them

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
work with the kids.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and this has worked the best.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So our dream is to bring teenagers together,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
so they'll have a community service experience

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
as well as a cross-cultural experience,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
as they teach kids in these areas

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and help them build their communication infrastructure.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
This is teaching Photoshop

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that these kids have made,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and they're quite incredible.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The one I want to show you --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
after we get them to make the movies,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
we have a night where we show the movies to the community.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And this is in Takaungu --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
we've got a generator and a digital projector,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and we're projecting it up against a barn,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and showing one of the movies that they made.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
the incredible work these kids do.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The other thing:

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That was one of the big motivating factors.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But the other motivating factor is

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the insular nature of our country.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
National Geographic just did a Roper Study

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of 18 to 26 year olds

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
in our country

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and in nine other industrialized countries.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It was a two million dollar study.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
United States came in second to last

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
in geographic knowledge.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
70 percent of the kids couldn't find

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
60 percent couldn't find India;

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And this is a study

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that was just done a couple of years ago.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So what I'd like to show you now,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in the couple of minutes I have left,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
is a film that a student made in Guatemala.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We just had a workshop in Guatemala.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
A week before we got to the workshop,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
last October, came in and buried

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
600 people alive in their village.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And this kid lived in the village --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
he wasn't there at the time --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and this is the little movie he put together about that.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And he hadn't seen a computer before

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
yeah, we can play it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
This is an old Mayan funeral chant

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that he got from his grandfather.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
(Applause)
