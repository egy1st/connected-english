WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That is the call that chimpanzees make

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
before they go to sleep in the evening.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from one group of nests to the next.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from where Zeray left off yesterday.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
through DNA genetic profiling.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's kind of commonplace now,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And you can tell an awful lot

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
from the shape of the muscle attachments,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
something about the way they lived

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
from the various artifacts found with them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
from that ancient, ancient past.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you very often find people speculating about how early humans

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They are more like us than any other living creature,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And we believe that this long period of childhood

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
As the brain becomes ever more complex

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
during evolution in different forms of animals,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in an individual's life history.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And we believe that it's in this way

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
how these are passed from one generation to the next,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
through observation, imitation and practice,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And they swagger and they throw rocks.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
precursors to love and true altruism.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They are very territorially aggressive.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
as we make even more observations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
have helped -- more than anything else --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This is just one photograph from the air,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and realized that outside the park, this forest,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that a question came to my mind.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and over the lake from Congo.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of the people living in the villages around the park.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
almost desert-like land up in these mountains.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
so that within two years they can again be productive.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Most important of all, I believe,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
is working with small groups of women,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we've got, as is the case around the world,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
about 95 percent of all loans returned.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Empowering women, working with education,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
as women's education improves, family size drops.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And as a result of this program,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
something's happening for conservation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
but when we began the TACARE program,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
asking what they were interested in.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They began to understand

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This is an area way outside the National Park,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
stretching out into all these very degraded lands.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And as these villages have a better standard of life,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
they are actually agreeing to put

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
so that once again, as the trees grow back,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
through which they can travel to interact --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
as they must for genetic viability --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
with other remnant groups outside the National Park.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So TACARE is a success.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
around other wilderness areas

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
which are faced with extreme population pressure.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
are major problems.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
There is a great deal of poverty.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And when you get large numbers of people

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
living in land that is not that fertile,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
particularly when you cut down trees,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
what's going to happen? Something's got to give.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
what are we doing to our planet?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
said that if every person on this planet

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
we need three new planets.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
with this extraordinary brain,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
capable of the kind of technology

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The indigenous people around the world,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
before they made a major decision,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
used to sit around and ask themselves,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
but the developed world --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
major decisions involving millions of dollars,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and millions of people, are often based on,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And these decisions affect Africa.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
As I began traveling around Africa

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
talking in the United States, going to Asia.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The earth is poisoning our foods.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that we're going to face in this century --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
industrial and household chemicals

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that still are being sprayed around the world,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The mangroves are being cut down;

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
We've talked about the soil erosion.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
leading to climate change.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
All around the world climates are mixed up.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It's Africa that already is affected.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
who are too poor to buy food,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
as the last of the trees are cut down.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So it wasn't surprising to me

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that as I was traveling around the world

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I asked a question. "Why?"

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
between this extraordinarily clever brain,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And these young people, when I talk to them,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
basically they were either depressed or apathetic,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and there's nothing we can do about it."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We have compromised their future.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I feel this desperation.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
which began right here in Tanzania

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
environmental and social. It's a message of hope.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
The most important message of Roots and Shoots:

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
so that the poor have choice as well.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It depends on how old they are, and which country,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And every group chooses, between them,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and impinge on each other.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
in other parts of the world.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
domestic animals as well.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And woven throughout all of this is a message

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
between religions and between us and the natural world.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
We not do have more than this one planet.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
or just using them to feed their families,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
with their vegetables and their chickens.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
It's being used in Uganda

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Once again, they're useful members of society.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
We have this program in prisons as well.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
with older kids talking to younger ones.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
from about one million, at the turn of the century,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And I mean, think of the technologies.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
It's one of my hobbyhorses.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Do we care about the planet for our children?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Do we care about their future?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
What we buy. What we wear.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And choose to make these choices with the question,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
how will this affect the environment around me?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
and we join hands around the world.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
All of these technologies we can use.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
This change, this change. To see change

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
that we must have if we care about the future.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And an example is the TACARE program.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
if you stop hacking them for firewood,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
the resilience of the human spirit,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
and take their part in changing the world.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
We could make a very long list,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
People like this are so inspirational.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And we need some environmental role models as well,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
and I've been hearing some of them today.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
again, with everyone at TED.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
especially the Roots and Shoots program.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And just a last word on that --

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I met her today.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
and see just one example of how young people,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
to make the world a better place,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
truly are our hope for tomorrow.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Thank you.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
(Applause)
