00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.715
Suppose that two American friends
are traveling together in Italy.

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.664
They go to see Michelangelo's "David,"

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:08.318
and when they finally come
face-to-face with the statue,

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.170
they both freeze dead in their tracks.

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:12.061
The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:14.805
is transfixed by the beauty
of the perfect human form.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:17.380
The second guy -- we'll call him Bill --

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:21.858
is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring
at the thing there in the center.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:24.571
So here's my question for you:

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:28.212
Which one of these two guys was more
likely to have voted for George Bush,

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.976
which for Al Gore?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.384
I don't need a show of hands,

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.797
because we all have the same
political stereotypes.

00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:35.976
We all know that it's Bill.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.429
And in this case, the stereotype
corresponds to reality.

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:42.827
It really is a fact that liberals
are much higher than conservatives

00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:46.000
on a major personality trait
called openness to experience.

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.594
People who are high
in openness to experience

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:52.062
just crave novelty, variety,
diversity, new ideas, travel.

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.323
People low on it like things
that are familiar,

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:56.767
that are safe and dependable.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:00:59.335
If you know about this trait,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.030
you can understand a lot of puzzles
about human behavior,

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.442
like why artists are so different
from accountants.

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.999
You can predict what kinds of books
they like to read,

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:09.038
what kinds of places
they like to travel to

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.979
and what kinds of food they like to eat.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.495
Once you understand this trait,

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:15.124
you can understand why anybody
would eat at Applebee's,

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:16.626
but not anybody that you know.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.699
(Laughter)

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.912
This trait also tells us
a lot about politics.

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.325
The main researcher of this trait,
Robert McCrae,

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.696
says that "Open individuals
have an affinity

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.455
for liberal, progressive,
left-wing political views ..."

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.969
They like a society
which is open and changing,

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:36.869
"... whereas closed individuals prefer

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:39.019
conservative, traditional,
right-wing views."

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.872
This trait also tells us a lot
about the kinds of groups people join.

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.385
Here's the description
of a group I found on the web.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.887
What kinds of people would join

00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:50.663
"a global community ... welcoming
people from every discipline and culture,

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:52.784
who seek a deeper
understanding of the world,

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:56.238
and who hope to turn that understanding
into a better future for us all"?

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.791
This is from some guy named Ted.

00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:58.967
Well, let's see now.

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.825
If openness predicts who becomes liberal,

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.578
and openness predicts
who becomes a TEDster,

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:07.102
then might we predict
that most TEDsters are liberal?

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:08.785
Let's find out.

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.366
I'll ask you to raise your hand,
whether you are liberal, left of center --

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.846
on social issues, primarily --

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.021
or conservative.

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:16.439
And I'll give a third option,

00:02:16.463 --> 00:02:19.008
because I know there are
libertarians in the audience.

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:21.708
So please raise your hand --
in the simulcast rooms too.

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:23.415
Let's let everybody see who's here.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.949
Please raise your hand if you'd say
that you're liberal or left of center.

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:29.042
Please raise your hand high right now. OK.

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:32.174
Please raise your hand
if you'd say you're libertarian.

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:34.548
OK. About two dozen.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:39.005
And please raise your hand if you'd say
you are right of center or conservative.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.628
One, two, three, four,
five -- about eight or 10.

00:02:43.652 --> 00:02:44.826
OK.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.900
This is a bit of a problem.

00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:51.542
Because if our goal is to seek
a deeper understanding of the world,

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:55.277
our general lack of moral diversity here
is going to make it harder.

00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:58.782
Because when people all share values,
when people all share morals,

00:02:58.806 --> 00:03:00.048
they become a team.

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:02.297
And once you engage
the psychology of teams,

00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.321
it shuts down open-minded thinking.

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.072
When the liberal team loses,

00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:10.918
[United States of Canada / Jesusland]

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:13.598
as it did in 2004,
and as it almost did in 2000,

00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:14.976
we comfort ourselves.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.175
(Laughter)

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.447
We try to explain why half of America
voted for the other team.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.388
We think they must be blinded by religion

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.651
[Post-election US map:
America / Dumbf*ckistan]

00:03:25.675 --> 00:03:27.004
or by simple stupidity.

00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:28.823
(Laughter)

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:31.671
(Applause)

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:38.180
(Laughter)

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:43.337
So if you think that half
of America votes Republican

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.799
because they are blinded in this way,

00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:49.048
then my message to you
is that you're trapped in a moral Matrix,

00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:50.474
in a particular moral Matrix.

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:54.173
And by "the Matrix," I mean literally
the Matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."

00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:56.182
But I'm here today to give you a choice.

00:03:56.206 --> 00:04:00.661
You can either take the blue pill
and stick to your comforting delusions,

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:02.098
or you can take the red pill,

00:04:02.122 --> 00:04:03.423
learn some moral psychology

00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:05.255
and step outside the moral Matrix.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.485
Now, because I know --

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:10.189
(Applause)

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:11.937
I assume that answers my question.

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:14.454
I was going to ask
which one you picked, but no need.

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.494
You're all high in openness to experience,

00:04:16.518 --> 00:04:19.718
and it looks like it might even taste
good, and you're all epicures.

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:22.705
Anyway, let's go with the red pill,
study some moral psychology

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.977
and see where it takes us.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.395
Let's start at the beginning:
What is morality, where does it come from?

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.121
The worst idea in all of psychology

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.669
is the idea that the mind
is a blank slate at birth.

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:34.717
Developmental psychology has shown
that kids come into the world

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.682
already knowing so much
about the physical and social worlds

00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:41.894
and programmed to make it really easy
for them to learn certain things

00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:43.346
and hard to learn others.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.541
The best definition
of innateness I've seen,

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:47.382
which clarifies so many things for me,

00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:49.321
is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.555
He says, "The initial
organization of the brain

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.548
does not depend that much on experience.

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:56.931
Nature provides a first draft,
which experience then revises.

00:04:56.955 --> 00:04:58.699
'Built-in' doesn't mean unmalleable;

00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:01.733
it means organized
in advance of experience."

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:04.634
OK, so what's on the first draft
of the moral mind?

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:08.345
To find out, my colleague Craig Joseph
and I read through the literature

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:10.671
on anthropology,
on culture variation in morality

00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.473
and also on evolutionary psychology,

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:13.654
looking for matches:

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:16.594
What sorts of things do people
talk about across disciplines

00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:18.827
that you find across cultures
and even species?

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.511
We found five best matches, which we call
the five foundations of morality.

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:24.110
The first one is harm/care.

00:05:24.134 --> 00:05:27.725
We're all mammals here, we all have a lot
of neural and hormonal programming

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.345
that makes us really bond
with others, care for others,

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:33.370
feel compassion for others,
especially the weak and vulnerable.

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:36.346
It gives us very strong feelings
about those who cause harm.

00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.156
This moral foundation
underlies about 70 percent

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.393
of the moral statements
I've heard here at TED.

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.976
The second foundation
is fairness/reciprocity.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.749
There's actually ambiguous evidence

00:05:45.773 --> 00:05:48.210
as to whether you find reciprocity
in other animals,

00:05:48.234 --> 00:05:50.536
but the evidence for people
could not be clearer.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.370
This Norman Rockwell painting
is called "The Golden Rule" --

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.895
as we heard from Karen Armstrong,
it's the foundation of many religions.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.398
That second foundation
underlies the other 30 percent

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:01.620
of the moral statements
I've heard here at TED.

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.624
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.

00:06:03.648 --> 00:06:06.582
You do find cooperative groups
in the animal kingdom,

00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:09.976
but these groups are always
either very small or they're all siblings.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.048
It's only among humans that you find
very large groups of people

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.976
who are able to cooperate
and join together into groups,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.573
but in this case, groups that are united
to fight other groups.

00:06:19.597 --> 00:06:23.447
This probably comes from our long history
of tribal living, of tribal psychology.

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:26.454
And this tribal psychology
is so deeply pleasurable

00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:29.481
that even when we don't have tribes,
we go ahead and make them,

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:30.740
because it's fun.

00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:34.149
(Laughter)

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:37.040
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:40.785
We get to exercise some ancient drives.

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.824
The fourth foundation
is authority/respect.

00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:44.385
Here you see submissive gestures

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.698
from two members
of very closely related species.

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:50.437
But authority in humans is not so closely
based on power and brutality

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:51.822
as it is in other primates.

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:55.552
It's based on more voluntary deference
and even elements of love, at times.

00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.271
The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:00.816
This painting is called
"The Allegory Of Chastity,"

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.832
but purity is not just about
suppressing female sexuality.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.800
It's about any kind of ideology,
any kind of idea

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:10.805
that tells you that you can attain virtue
by controlling what you do with your body

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:12.388
and what you put into your body.

00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:15.693
And while the political right
may moralize sex much more,

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:18.066
the political left is doing
a lot of it with food.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.242
Food is becoming extremely
moralized nowadays.

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:21.897
A lot of it is ideas about purity,

00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.707
about what you're willing
to touch or put into your body.

00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.622
I believe these
are the five best candidates

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.280
for what's written on the first draft
of the moral mind.

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:33.961
I think this is what we come with,
a preparedness to learn all these things.

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:37.271
But as my son Max grows up
in a liberal college town,

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:39.698
how is this first draft
going to get revised?

00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:41.552
And how will it end up being different

00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:44.632
from a kid born 60 miles south of us,
in Lynchburg, Virginia?

00:07:44.656 --> 00:07:47.725
To think about culture variation,
let's try a different metaphor.

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:50.231
If there really are five systems
at work in the mind,

00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:52.165
five sources of intuitions and emotions,

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:55.387
then we can think of the moral mind
as one of those audio equalizers

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:56.562
that has five channels,

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:59.463
where you can set it to a different
setting on every channel.

00:07:59.487 --> 00:08:01.742
My colleagues Brian Nosek
and Jesse Graham and I

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:06.650
made a questionnaire, which we put up
on the web at www.YourMorals.org.

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:10.655
And so far, 30,000 people have taken
this questionnaire, and you can, too.

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:14.881
Here are the results
from about 23,000 American citizens.

00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:16.820
On the left are the scores for liberals;

00:08:16.844 --> 00:08:19.381
on the right, conservatives;
in the middle, moderates.

00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:23.200
The blue line shows people's responses
on the average of all the harm questions.

00:08:23.224 --> 00:08:25.817
So as you see, people care
about harm and care issues.

00:08:25.841 --> 00:08:29.004
They highly endorse these sorts
of statements all across the board,

00:08:29.028 --> 00:08:30.179
but as you also see,

00:08:30.203 --> 00:08:33.931
liberals care about it a little more
than conservatives; the line slopes down.

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:35.330
Same story for fairness.

00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:36.976
But look at the other three lines.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.823
For liberals, the scores are very low.

00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:41.087
They're basically saying,
"This is not morality.

00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.971
In-group, authority, purity -- this has
nothing to do with morality. I reject it."

00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:47.480
But as people get more
conservative, the values rise.

00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:50.617
We can say liberals have
a two-channel or two-foundation morality.

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:52.740
Conservatives have more
of a five-foundation,

00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:53.957
or five-channel morality.

00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:55.939
We find this in every country we look at.

00:08:55.963 --> 00:08:59.458
Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians.
I'll flip through a few other slides.

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:02.439
The UK, Australia, New Zealand,
Western Europe, Eastern Europe,

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:05.976
Latin America, the Middle East,
East Asia and South Asia.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.912
Notice also that on all of these graphs,

00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.739
the slope is steeper
on in-group, authority, purity,

00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:13.475
which shows that, within any country,

00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:15.645
the disagreement
isn't over harm and fairness.

00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:17.380
I mean, we debate over what's fair,

00:09:17.404 --> 00:09:20.674
but everybody agrees
that harm and fairness matter.

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:22.834
Moral arguments within cultures

00:09:22.858 --> 00:09:26.036
are especially about issues
of in-group, authority, purity.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.471
This effect is so robust, we find
it no matter how we ask the question.

00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:31.168
In a recent study, we asked people,

00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:32.817
suppose you're about to get a dog,

00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.435
you picked a particular breed,
learned about the breed.

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:38.569
Suppose you learn that this particular
breed is independent-minded

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:40.942
and relates to its owner
as a friend and an equal.

00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:43.070
If you're a liberal,
you say, "That's great!"

00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:45.248
because liberals like to say,
"Fetch! Please."

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:49.881
(Laughter)

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.919
But if you're a conservative,
that's not so attractive.

00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:55.802
If you're conservative and learn
that a dog's extremely loyal

00:09:55.826 --> 00:09:56.977
to its home and family

00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.577
and doesn't warm up to strangers,

00:09:58.601 --> 00:10:01.372
for conservatives, loyalty is good;
dogs ought to be loyal.

00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:02.548
But to a liberal,

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:05.631
it sounds like this dog is running
for the Republican nomination.

00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:06.657
(Laughter)

00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:10.267
You might say, OK, there are differences
between liberals and conservatives,

00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.579
but what makes the three
other foundations moral?

00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:16.133
Aren't they the foundations of xenophobia,
authoritarianism and puritanism?

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.312
What makes them moral?

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:21.303
The answer, I think, is contained in this
incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:22.907
"The Garden of Earthly Delights."

00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:25.560
In the first panel, we see
the moment of creation.

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.501
All is ordered, all is beautiful,

00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:30.867
all the people and animals are doing
what they're supposed to be doing,

00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:32.477
are where they're supposed to be.

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.933
But then, given the way
of the world, things change.

00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:37.020
We get every person doing
whatever he wants,

00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:40.096
with every aperture of every other
person and every other animal.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.219
Some of you might recognize
this as the '60s.

00:10:42.243 --> 00:10:43.655
(Laughter)

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:47.107
But the '60s inevitably
gives way to the '70s,

00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.546
where the cuttings of the apertures
hurt a little bit more.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.724
Of course, Bosch called this hell.

00:10:52.748 --> 00:10:56.877
So this triptych, these three panels,

00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:01.190
portray the timeless truth
that order tends to decay.

00:11:01.214 --> 00:11:03.019
The truth of social entropy.

00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:06.334
But lest you think this is just
some part of the Christian imagination

00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:08.942
where Christians have
this weird problem with pleasure,

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:11.028
here's the same story,
the same progression,

00:11:11.052 --> 00:11:14.021
told in a paper that was published
in "Nature" a few years ago,

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:18.042
in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gächter
had people play a commons dilemma,

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:19.976
a game in which you give people money,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.718
and then, on each round of the game,

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:23.775
they can put money into a common pot,

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.807
then the experimenter
doubles what's there,

00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:27.883
and then it's all divided
among the players.

00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:30.804
So it's a nice analog
for all sorts of environmental issues,

00:11:30.828 --> 00:11:32.926
where we're asking people
to make a sacrifice

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.529
and they don't really benefit
from their own sacrifice.

00:11:35.553 --> 00:11:37.614
You really want everybody
else to sacrifice,

00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:39.694
but everybody has
a temptation to free ride.

00:11:39.718 --> 00:11:43.110
What happens is that, at first,
people start off reasonably cooperative.

00:11:43.134 --> 00:11:44.976
This is all played anonymously.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.550
On the first round, people give
about half of the money that they can.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:51.244
But they quickly see
other people aren't doing so much.

00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:53.580
"I don't want to be a sucker.
I won't cooperate."

00:11:53.604 --> 00:11:55.046
So cooperation quickly decays

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.635
from reasonably good
down to close to zero.

00:11:57.659 --> 00:11:59.339
But then -- and here's the trick --

00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:01.795
Fehr and Gächter,
on the seventh round, told people,

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:03.027
"You know what? New rule.

00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:05.186
If you want to give some of your own money

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.719
to punish people who aren't contributing,

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:09.098
you can do that."

00:12:09.122 --> 00:12:12.532
And as soon as people heard
about the punishment issue going on,

00:12:12.556 --> 00:12:13.782
cooperation shoots up.

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:15.495
It shoots up and it keeps going up.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.054
Lots of research shows that to solve
cooperative problems, it really helps.

00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:21.483
It's not enough to appeal
to people's good motives.

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.484
It helps to have some sort of punishment.

00:12:23.508 --> 00:12:25.899
Even if it's just shame
or embarrassment or gossip,

00:12:25.923 --> 00:12:27.463
you need some sort of punishment

00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:30.300
to bring people, when they're in large
groups, to cooperate.

00:12:30.324 --> 00:12:33.264
There's even some recent research
suggesting that religion --

00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:35.432
priming God, making
people think about God --

00:12:35.456 --> 00:12:39.624
often, in some situations, leads to more
cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:42.484
Some people think
that religion is an adaptation

00:12:42.508 --> 00:12:44.800
evolved both by cultural
and biological evolution

00:12:44.824 --> 00:12:46.550
to make groups to cohere,

00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:48.772
in part for the purpose
of trusting each other

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:51.428
and being more effective
at competing with other groups.

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:54.364
That's probably right,
although this is a controversial issue.

00:12:54.388 --> 00:12:57.745
But I'm particularly interested
in religion and the origin of religion

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:59.855
and in what it does to us and for us,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:03.326
because I think the greatest wonder
in the world is not the Grand Canyon.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.178
The Grand Canyon is really simple --

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:08.373
a lot of rock and a lot of water
and wind and a lot of time,

00:13:08.397 --> 00:13:09.790
and you get the Grand Canyon.

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:11.055
It's not that complicated.

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:12.369
This is what's complicated:

00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:16.242
that people lived in places like the Grand
Canyon, cooperating with each other,

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:19.143
or on the savannahs of Africa
or the frozen shores of Alaska.

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:22.518
And some of these villages
grew into the mighty cities of Babylon

00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:23.976
and Rome and Tenochtitlan.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.151
How did this happen?

00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:28.538
It's an absolute miracle, much harder
to explain than the Grand Canyon.

00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:31.655
The answer, I think, is that they used
every tool in the toolbox.

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:35.031
It took all of our moral psychology
to create these cooperative groups.

00:13:35.055 --> 00:13:38.627
Yes, you need to be concerned about harm,
you need a psychology of justice.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.255
But it helps to organize a group
if you have subgroups,

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.976
and if those subgroups
have some internal structure,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.239
and if you have some ideology
that tells people

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:49.775
to suppress their carnality --
to pursue higher, nobler ends.

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:54.494
Now we get to the crux of the disagreement
between liberals and conservatives:

00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:56.763
liberals reject
three of these foundations.

00:13:56.787 --> 00:14:00.127
They say, "Let's celebrate diversity,
not common in-group membership,"

00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:03.365
and, "Let's question authority,"
and, "Keep your laws off my body."

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:05.638
Liberals have very noble
motives for doing this.

00:14:05.662 --> 00:14:09.212
Traditional authority and morality
can be quite repressive and restrictive

00:14:09.236 --> 00:14:12.103
to those at the bottom, to women,
to people who don't fit in.

00:14:12.127 --> 00:14:14.139
Liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.

00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:16.790
They want change and justice,
even at the risk of chaos.

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:19.308
This shirt says, "Stop bitching,
start a revolution."

00:14:19.332 --> 00:14:23.310
If you're high in openness to experience,
revolution is good; it's change, it's fun.

00:14:23.334 --> 00:14:26.720
Conservatives, on the other hand,
speak for institutions and traditions.

00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:29.531
They want order, even at some cost,
to those at the bottom.

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:32.903
The great conservative insight
is that order is really hard to achieve.

00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:35.210
It's precious,
and it's really easy to lose.

00:14:35.234 --> 00:14:37.493
So as Edmund Burke said,
"The restraints on men,

00:14:37.517 --> 00:14:40.670
as well as their liberties,
are to be reckoned among their rights."

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:43.036
This was after the chaos
of the French Revolution.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.184
Once you see that liberals
and conservatives

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:46.874
both have something to contribute,

00:14:46.898 --> 00:14:49.976
that they form a balance
on change versus stability,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.976
then I think the way is open
to step outside the moral Matrix.

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:55.085
This is the great insight

00:14:55.109 --> 00:14:57.636
that all the Asian religions
have attained.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.242
Think about yin and yang.

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.906
Yin and yang aren't enemies;
they don't hate each other.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.519
Yin and yang are both necessary,
like night and day,

00:15:04.543 --> 00:15:06.136
for the functioning of the world.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.886
You find the same thing in Hinduism.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.684
There are many high gods in Hinduism.

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.723
Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver,
and Shiva, the destroyer.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.800
This image, actually,
is both of those gods

00:15:14.824 --> 00:15:16.049
sharing the same body.

00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:18.512
You have the markings
of Vishnu on the left,

00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:20.976
so we could think of Vishnu
as the conservative god.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.366
You have the markings of Shiva
on the right -- Shiva's the liberal god.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.549
And they work together.

00:15:25.573 --> 00:15:27.299
You find the same thing in Buddhism.

00:15:27.323 --> 00:15:29.948
These two stanzas contain,
I think, the deepest insights

00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:32.362
that have ever been attained
into moral psychology.

00:15:32.386 --> 00:15:34.563
From the Zen master Sēngcàn:

00:15:34.587 --> 00:15:38.690
"If you want the truth to stand clear
before you, never be 'for' or 'against.'

00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:42.034
The struggle between 'for' and 'against'
is the mind's worst disease."

00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:45.209
Unfortunately, it's a disease
that has been caught

00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:46.725
by many of the world's leaders.

00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:48.840
But before you feel
superior to George Bush,

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.058
before you throw a stone, ask yourself:

00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:52.262
Do you accept this?

00:15:53.088 --> 00:15:56.340
Do you accept stepping out
of the battle of good and evil?

00:15:56.364 --> 00:15:58.807
Can you be not for or against anything?

00:15:59.512 --> 00:16:02.282
So what's the point? What should you do?

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:04.874
Well, if you take the greatest insights

00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:07.002
from ancient Asian
philosophies and religions

00:16:07.026 --> 00:16:09.963
and combine them with the latest
research on moral psychology,

00:16:09.987 --> 00:16:11.797
I think you come to these conclusions:

00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:14.976
that our righteous minds
were designed by evolution

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.657
to unite us into teams,

00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:18.222
to divide us against other teams

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:19.946
and then to blind us to the truth.

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:23.236
So what should you do?

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.120
Am I telling you to not strive?

00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:27.848
Am I telling you to embrace
Sēngcàn and stop,

00:16:27.872 --> 00:16:30.742
stop with the struggle of for and against?

00:16:30.766 --> 00:16:32.976
No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.976
This is an amazing group of people
who are doing so much,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.738
using so much of their talent,

00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:39.820
their brilliance,
their energy, their money,

00:16:39.844 --> 00:16:41.440
to make the world a better place,

00:16:41.464 --> 00:16:43.195
to fight wrongs,

00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:44.499
to solve problems.

00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:48.176
But as we learned from Samantha Power

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.008
in her story about Sérgio Vieira de Mello,

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:57.277
you can't just go charging in,
saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right,"

00:16:57.301 --> 00:17:00.714
because, as we just heard,
everybody thinks they are right.

00:17:00.738 --> 00:17:02.596
A lot of the problems we have to solve

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.117
are problems that require us
to change other people.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.553
And if you want to change other people,

00:17:07.577 --> 00:17:10.735
a much better way to do it
is to first understand who we are --

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:12.397
understand our moral psychology,

00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:15.017
understand that we all
think we're right --

00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:16.304
and then step out,

00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:20.023
even if it's just for a moment,
step out -- check in with Sēngcàn.

00:17:20.568 --> 00:17:21.976
Step out of the moral Matrix,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.099
just try to see it
as a struggle playing out,

00:17:24.123 --> 00:17:27.741
in which everybody thinks they're right,
and even if you disagree with them,

00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:30.129
everybody has some reasons
for what they're doing.

00:17:30.153 --> 00:17:31.304
Step out.

00:17:31.328 --> 00:17:34.814
And if you do that, that's the essential
move to cultivate moral humility,

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:37.040
to get yourself out
of this self-righteousness,

00:17:37.064 --> 00:17:38.783
which is the normal human condition.

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.122
Think about the Dalai Lama.

00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.976
Think about the enormous
moral authority of the Dalai Lama.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.777
It comes from his moral humility.

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.032
So I think the point --

00:17:48.056 --> 00:17:52.270
the point of my talk
and, I think, the point of TED --

00:17:52.294 --> 00:17:54.976
is that this is a group
that is passionately engaged

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.477
in the pursuit of changing
the world for the better.

00:17:57.501 --> 00:17:59.503
People here are passionately engaged

00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:01.558
in trying to make
the world a better place.

00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:04.426
But there is also a passionate
commitment to the truth.

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:09.873
And so I think the answer is to use
that passionate commitment to the truth

00:18:09.897 --> 00:18:12.740
to try to turn it
into a better future for us all.

00:18:12.764 --> 00:18:13.976
Thank you.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.253
(Applause)
