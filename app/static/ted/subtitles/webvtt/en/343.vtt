00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
(Applause)

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're not going to show you any of it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it's not the most exciting story from the sea.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Most of the planet is ocean water.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The average depth is about two miles.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or we see images like this of the ocean,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but you have no idea for what lies in there.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Most of the animals are in the oceans.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
at the bottom of the sea.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
than it is in the rainforests.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We have to have a very special technology

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to get into that unfamiliar world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
not only on what exists --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but also how we think about life on the planet itself.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Here's a jelly.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It gets up to about 150 feet long.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But see all those different working things?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I love that kind of stuff.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a colonial animal.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
These are all individual animals

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
banding together to make this one creature.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
on the other side, those guys win hands down.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Here's the X-wing death jelly.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Laughter)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and attracting prey and communicating.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They come in all different sizes and shapes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And these are the types of animals

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that live in that three-dimensional space,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You hear about giant squid and things like that,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They're very little understood.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You can actually see through his head.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
They come right up to the submarine --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is really a world within a world,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and we're going to show you two.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And then one of my favorites. What a face!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in the world where they belong.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
They don't catch them in a net.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They're actually looking at them down in that world.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We're going to take a joystick,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
sit in front of our computer, on the Earth,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
a 40,000-mile long mountain range.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and this is one of those mountain ranges.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
is greater than the Alps in most cases.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This is a volcanic ridge.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We're getting down further and further in scale.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And you can sit in a room like this,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
around the bottom of the ocean in real time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
is to bring this virtual world --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
hydrogen-sulfide-rich water

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So that's all water under the sea --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And then we had some hint that these things existed

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so the setting here is very dramatic.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
BL: The white material is a type of bacteria

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that thrives at 180 degrees C.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And we started to wonder for a long time,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
how did it all get down there?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Not only is it coming out of the Earth --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
no sun has ever gotten down here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
All the energy to support these life forms

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And you can see how dense the population is.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
These are called tube worms.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But they have two types of gill structures.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
which takes the hydrothermal fluid --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Oh! Good going.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, as soon as a crab touches them,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There's a whole story being played out here

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that we're just now beginning to have some idea of

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
because of this new camera technology.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and their head is out at three degrees C,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
That's how they like to live.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Laughter)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
DG: This is a female of this kind of worm.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And here's a male.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Here they go.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
On one of the last dive series,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we counted 200 species in these areas --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
198 were new, new species.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And they disintegrate on the way up,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
so the imagery is critical for the science.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This pressure thing really amazes me --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that these animals can exist there at a depth

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And the same thing's going on over here.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that lives on the backs of all these animals.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And what these shrimp are trying to do

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And the crabs don't like it at all.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
are actually created by the product of that bacteria.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
On the back, you see this again.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Those are all shrimp.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They're clinging to a rock face

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Those pillars get up to several stories.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
inhabited by these very strange animals

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
They don't need the sun at all.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's actually a light-sensing organ.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We're moving up one of these pillars.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This one's several stories tall.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So all of these are individual homes for worms.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Now here's a closer view of that community.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Here's crabs here, worms here.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
There are smaller animals crawling around.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Here's pagoda structures.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I just can't get over this --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and it's coming out all from it.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
(Laughter)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
That's probably where we evolved from.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
There are a number of groups that are proposing

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that life evolved at these vent sites.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Although the vent sites are short-lived --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
an individual site may last only 10 years or so --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There's a fish sitting here.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
waiting for that worm to stick his head out.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
(Laughter)

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
BL: The biologists right now cannot explain

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
why these animals are so active.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
The worms are growing inches per week!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
DG: I already said that this site,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that plumbing system turns off every year or so.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And then there's earthquakes,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that completely wipes the area out.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Is it sensitive? Yes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I'll end up with saying one thing.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's an incredible story.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
What we see when we look back in time,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The continents move apart. They come back together.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It's just like music -- it really is just like music.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And what we're learning now is that

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's absurd. It's just absurd.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
at all these different scales and work with it.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Learn to manage it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
The concept of preservation is futile.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Thank you.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Applause)
