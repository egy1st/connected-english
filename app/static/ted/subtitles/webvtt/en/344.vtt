00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, a big question that we're facing now

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and have been for quite a number of years now:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
are we at risk of a nuclear attack?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, there's a bigger question

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that's probably actually more important than that,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is the notion of permanently eliminating

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the possibility of a nuclear attack,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
eliminating the threat altogether.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I would like to make a case to you that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
until this very moment,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's characterized by two phases,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which I'm going to go through with you right now.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
through the Manhattan Project,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the idea was very straightforward:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we would use the power of the atom

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to end the atrocities and the horror

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of this unending World War II

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And in 1945,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we were the only nuclear power.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We had a few nuclear weapons,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
killing about 250,000 people between those two.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And for a few years,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we were the only nuclear power on Earth.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and they began to match what the United States had developed.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And from 1949 to 1985

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
was an extraordinary time

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that no one could possibly have imagined

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
back in the 1940s.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is equivalent of a thousands warheads --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the world had

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
65,000 nuclear warheads,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and seven members of something

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that came to be known as the "nuclear club."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it was an extraordinary time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and I am going to go through some of the mentality

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that we -- that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of the nuclear weapons at any particular time

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
since 1985 -- going forward, of course --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
were part of the arsenals

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of the United States and the Soviet Union.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we began to disarm

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
from a nuclear point of view.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We began to counter-proliferate,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to about a total of 21,000.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's a very difficult number to deal with,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because what we've done is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
we've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but the way they count things, which is very complicated,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we think we have about a third

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of the nuclear weapons we had before.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But we also, in that period of time,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
added two more members to the nuclear club:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Pakistan and North Korea.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
among many countries around the world,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but a very different set of circumstances.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So I'm going to talk about

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
a nuclear threat story in two chapters.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
when the Soviet Union broke up,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It was characterized by

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
a nation-versus-nation,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
very fragile standoff.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And basically,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
we lived for all those years,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and some might argue that we still do,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in a situation of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
being on the brink, literally,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We were totally dependent during those years

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It stands for mutually assured destruction.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So it meant

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
if you attacked us, we would attack you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
virtually simultaneously,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and the end result would be a destruction

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of your country and mine.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So the threat of my own destruction

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
kept me from launching

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the danger of that, of course, is that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
a misreading of a radar screen

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
could actually cause a counter-launch,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
even though the first country had not actually launched anything.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
During this chapter one,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
there was a high level of public awareness

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and an indelible image was implanted

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in our collective minds

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
would be absolutely globally destructive

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So this was chapter one.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now the odd thing is that even though

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we knew that there would be

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that kind of civilization obliteration,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we engaged in America in a series --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and in fact, in the Soviet Union --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in a series of response planning.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It was absolutely incredible.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So premise one is we'd be destroying the world,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So what

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
we offered ourselves

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
just to jog your memories.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If you're born after 1950, this is just --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
This was Bert the Turtle. (Video)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
This was basically an attempt

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to teach our schoolchildren

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that if we did get engaged

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
then we wanted our school children

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to kind of basically duck and cover.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That was the principle. You --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
there would be a nuclear conflagration

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
about to hit us, and if you get under your desk,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
things would be OK.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I didn't do all that well

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and I think this was seriously delusional.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Secondly, we told people

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to go down in their basements

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and build a fallout shelter.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that you could simply bury in the ground.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Now, the bomb shelters at that point --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yet, what percentage of Americans

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of the population, as far as anyone knows,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
did anything,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
either making a space in their basement

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
or actually building a bomb shelter.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Many buildings, public buildings, around the country --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
this is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and the idea was that you would

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
run into one of these shelters and be safe

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
from the nuclear weaponry.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And one of the greatest governmental delusions

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
of all time was something that happened

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in the early days of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Here is their first big public

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
announcement.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They would propose --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
actually there were about six volumes written on this --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
a crisis relocation plan

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that was dependent upon

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the United States having three to four days warning

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that the Soviets were going to attack us.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We would move people out of the target cities

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
into the countryside.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
about the absolute ludicrous idea

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that we would actually evacuate,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and actually have three or four days' warning.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It was just completely off the wall.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Turns out that they had another idea

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
behind it, even though this was --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
they were telling the public it was to save us.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The idea was that we would force the Soviets

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and potentially double their arsenal,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to not only take out the original site,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but take out sites where people were going.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It was just really, really frightening.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The main point here is we were dealing with

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a complete disconnect from reality.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The civil defense programs were disconnected

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So no possibility of medical response to,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or meaningful preparedness for

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
all-out nuclear war.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So we had to prevent nuclear war

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
if we expected to survive.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This disconnect was never actually resolved.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And what happened was --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
when we get in to chapter two

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of the nuclear threat era,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
which started back in 1945.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Chapter two starts in 1991.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
When the Soviet Union broke up,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
we effectively lost that adversary

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But from 1991

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
through the present time,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
emphasized by the attacks of 2001,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the idea of an all-out nuclear war

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
has diminished and the idea of a single event,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
act of nuclear terrorism

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
is what we have instead.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Although the scenario has changed

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
very considerably, the fact is

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that we haven't changed our mental image

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of what a nuclear war means.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So, what is a nuclear terror threat?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And there's four key ingredients to describing that.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
happen to be not uniformly secure.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And it's particularly not secure

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
There are many, many sites where warheads are stored

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
are absolutely not safe.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They're acquirable, let me put it that way.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
From 1993 through 2006,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the International Atomic Energy Agency

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
is about 1,300, at the low end,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to about 2,100 metric tons.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
More than 100 megatons of this

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is stored in particularly insecure

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Russian facilities.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
How much of that do you think it would take

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, what I'd like to show you

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
what it would take to hold 75 pounds

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
of highly enriched uranium.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is not a product placement. It's just --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Laughter)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
-- but

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
basically, this is it.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is what you would need to steal or buy

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that's relatively insecure

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to create the type of bomb

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that was used in Hiroshima.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now you might want to look at plutonium

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
That -- you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
this. This is enough plutonium

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Now this situation, already I --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
you know, I don't really like thinking about this,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
although somehow I got myself a job

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
where I have to think about it. So

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the point is that we're very, very insecure

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in terms of developing this material.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The second thing is, what about the know-how?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And there's a lot of controversy about

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
whether terror organizations have the know-how

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
to actually make a nuclear weapon.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Well, there's a lot of know-how out there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
There's detailed information on how to assemble

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
a nuclear weapon from parts.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
There are plans for how to create a terror farm

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
where you could actually manufacture and develop

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
all the components and assemble it.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
All of this information is relatively available.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
If you have an undergraduate degree in physics,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I would suggest --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
although I don't, so maybe it's not even true --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but something close to that would allow you,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
with the information that's currently available,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to actually build a nuclear weapon.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The third element of the nuclear terror threat

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is that, who would actually do such a thing?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that involves individuals who are highly organized.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
They are very dedicated and committed.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
They are stateless.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Somebody once said, Al Qaeda

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
does not have a return address,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
what's the response, and to whom is the response?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And they're retaliation-proof.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Since there is no real retribution possible

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that would make any difference,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
since there are people willing to actually give up their lives

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in order to do a lot of damage to us,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it becomes apparent

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that the whole notion

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
of this mutually assured destruction would not work.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
He wrote many, many times statements to this effect:

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
"we have the right to kill four million Americans,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
two million of whom should be children."

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And we don't have to go overseas

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
in the 1990s

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
was a good example of homegrown terrorists.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
The fourth element

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is that the high-value U.S. targets

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
are accessible, soft and plentiful.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that the United States has achieved

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
since 9/11 of '01

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
is unbelievably inadequate.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
What you saw after Katrina

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is a very good indicator

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
of how little prepared the United States is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
for any kind of major attack.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Seven million ship cargo containers

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
come into the United States every year.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Five to seven percent only are inspected --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
five to seven percent.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
This is Alexander Lebed,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
who was a general that worked with Yeltsin,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
who talked about, and presented to Congress,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
this idea that the Russians had developed --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
0.1 to one kiloton,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And Lebed came to the United States

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and told us that many, many --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
more than 80 of the suitcase bombs

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
were actually not accountable.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
You put the elements into a suitcase.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It becomes very portable.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in your trunk of your car.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and you happen to get one of those insecure

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
nuclear warheads that exist.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This is the size of

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It was 9.8 feet long,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
your local rent-a-truck

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and for 50 bucks or so,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
you rent a truck that's got the right capacity,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and you take your bomb,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
but what I'm trying to say is that

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
we have all the elements of that happening.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Anybody who dismisses the thought

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
of a nuclear weapon

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community --

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
a lot of people who deal with this work in general

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to really try to defuse the risk,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
like better interdiction, better prevention,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
better fixing, you know, better screening

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
At this particular moment,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
we actually could end up

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
There's still enough nuclear weapons

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
in the arsenals of the superpowers

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to destroy the Earth many, many times over.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
There are flash points in India and Pakistan,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
in the Middle East, in North Korea,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
other places where the use of nuclear weapons,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
while initially locally,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
could very rapidly

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
go into a situation

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It's very unsettling.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Here we go. OK.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
We're coming down,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and we bring that truck

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
that you just saw

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
somewhere in here, in the Financial District.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
This is a 10-kiloton bomb,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
slightly smaller than was used

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
by just giving you some information. I think --

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
"news you could use" kind of concept here.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So, first of all, this would be horrific

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
beyond anything we can possibly imagine.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
This is the ultimate.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And if you're in the half-mile radius

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
of where this bomb went off,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
If you're right where the bomb went off,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
you will be vaporized. And that's --

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I'm just telling you, this is not good.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Laughter)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
You assume that.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
of being killed,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and up to about eight miles away --

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
now I'm talking about killed instantly --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
chance of getting killed.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
The thing about this is that

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the experience of the nuclear detonation is --

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
at the core here, where it goes off,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and an extraordinary amount of energy

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
in the form of heat, acute radiation

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and blast effects.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
An enormous hurricane-like wind,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and destruction of buildings almost totally,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
within this yellow circle here.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
is that, what happens to you

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
if you're in here?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Well, if we're talking about the old days

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
of an all-out nuclear attack,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
you, up here,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
My point now, though, is that there is a lot

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
that we could do for you who are in here,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
if you've survived the initial blast.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You have, when the blast goes off --

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
(Laughter)

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
If you look at it, you're going to be blind,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
either temporarily or permanently.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
So if there's any way that you can avoid,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
If you find yourself alive, but

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
you have -- that's gone off --

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and exactly where it went off,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
to get out of the way before

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
a lethal amount of radiation

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do --

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and I mean this seriously --

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
is go about a mile

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
away from the blast.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And what happens is -- this is --

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
it comes straight down. Within 24 hours,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and it's mostly in this particular direction --

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
it's going northeast.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So you're feeling the wind --

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
and there's tremendous wind now

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
that you're going to be feeling -- and you want to go

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
perpendicular to the wind

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[not upwind or downwind].

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You've got to get out of there.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
to lethal radiation in very short order.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
If you can't get out of there,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Now, in a shelter in an urban area means

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor --

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
or in the basement.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And if you do that,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
you actually can survive a nuclear blast.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Over the next few days to a week,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
there will be a radiation cloud,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
again, going with the wind, and settling down

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
for another 15 or 20 miles out --

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
in this case, over Long Island.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And if you're in the direct fallout zone here,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and that's clear. But if you are sheltered,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
you can actually survive.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
The difference between knowing information

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
of what you're going to do personally,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and not knowing information, can save your life,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
and it could mean the difference between

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
150,000 to 200,000 fatalities

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
from something like this

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
So, response planning in the twenty-first century

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
is both possible and is essential.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
But in 2008, there isn't one single American city

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
that has done effective plans

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Part of the problem is that

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
the emergency planners themselves, personally,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
of nuclear catastrophe.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
They are paralyzed.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
You say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
We can change the survival rates

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
by doing some commonsensical things."

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And I just want to leave you with the personal points

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
that I think you might be interested in.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
The key to surviving a nuclear blast

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
is getting out,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
and not going into harm's way.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
That's basically all we're going to be talking about here.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And the farther you are away in distance,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the longer it is in time

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
from the initial blast;

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and the more separation between you

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and the outside atmosphere, the better.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
or being in a basement --

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
distance and time is what will save you.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So here's what you do. First of all,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
as I said, don't stare at the light flash,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
don't burst from the pressures.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And you want to get under something so that you're not injured

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
or killed by objects, if that's at all possible.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I said, in just a few minutes.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And shelter and place. You want to move [only]

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
crosswind for 1.2 miles.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
and down in that direction,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
less destroyed here,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
as long as you're going crosswise to the wind.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Once you're out and evacuating,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
you want to keep as much of your skin,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
you're going to get showered down some place

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
and remove the radiation that would be --

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
the radioactive material that might be on you.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
but you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
battery-less radio,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
and you'll be waiting for people to tell you

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
In conclusion,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
nuclear war is less likely than before,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
but is survivable.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
of the U.S. public health community.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
And Jack said the only way to deal

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
with nuclear anything,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
whether it's war or terrorism,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
is abolition of nuclear weapons.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I urge you to think about the fact that

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
we have to do something about this

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
unacceptable, inhumane

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
reality of nuclear weapons

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
in our world.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
(Laughter)

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
-- I don't want to be indelicate, but

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
this --

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
This was sent to me by somebody

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
but the fact of the matter is that

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
America's gone through a very hard time.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
and now we're facing the potential of

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
bad, hell on Earth.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Thank you.
