WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.976
[SHIT]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.976
This is arguably the back end
of the design of animals.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.976
(Laughter)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.420
But the reason
I put this up here is because

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:20.555
when I was in Africa last year,
my wife and I were driving around,

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.801
we had this wonderful guide,

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.976
who showed us something
that surprised both of us,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.976
and it was very revealing
in terms of the fascination

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.976
that comes with the design of animals.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.976
It turns out that in about the 1880s,
the missionaries came to Africa

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.976
to spread the word of Christianity,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.977
to teach English to the natives.

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.894
And they brought blackboards and chalk.

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:44.471
And I'd like you to imagine
that that's a blackboard,

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.317
and I just used some chalk on there.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:48.742
And they brought
quite a bit of this stuff.

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.403
But over the years,
the blackboards were fine,

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:53.404
but they ran out of chalk.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.428
And this is a real crisis for them.

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.301
And that's where the hyena comes in.

00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.076
The hyena is probably
the most perfectly designed

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.977
scavenging animal in the world.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.976
It strip-mines carcasses,
and it has amazing teeth,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.793
because it enables the hyena
to essentially eat bones.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, the end product of that action
is up on the board here.

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.665
What the missionaries would do is,
they'd walk around

00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:24.753
and they'd pick up hyena shit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.476
And the incredible thing
about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.055
(Laughter)

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.976
That's not what I'm here to talk about,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.611
but it is a fascinating aspect
of animal design.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:38.976
What I'm here to talk about is the camel.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.976
When I started talking to Richard

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.976
about what I was going to speak about,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.624
I had recently come back from Jordan,

00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:48.870
where I had an amazing
experience with a camel.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.976
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.421
And we were in the desert.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.262
Richard Wurman: That's the end!
Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.531
We were in the desert,
in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:01.555
There were four of us,
two Bedouin drivers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.887
You can just imagine,
this expanse is an ocean of sand,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
105 degrees, one water bottle.

00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:13.960
And we were driving in what they told us
was their very, very best Jeep.

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:16.602
Didn't look like it to me.

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:19.528
And as we started to go
through the desert,

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:21.976
the Jeep broke down.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.976
The guys got out, they put the hood up,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.675
they started working
under the hood, got it going again.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.469
About a hundred yards, it broke down.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:31.770
This went on about 6-7 times,
we were getting more and more alarmed,

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:34.452
we were also getting deeper
and deeper into the desert.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:36.976
And eventually,
our worst nightmare happened:

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.976
they flooded the engine.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.724
And they said, "Ah, no problem!
We just get out and walk."

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.977
And we said, "We get out and walk?"

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.253
One water bottle, remember,
guys, four people.

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:50.634
And they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk.
We'll find some camels."

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:52.897
We got out and walked, and sure enough,

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.531
about half a mile, we came
over the crest of this hill,

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.453
and there was a huge gathering
of Bedouin with their camels.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.372
The guy went up and started dickering,

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:02.976
and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.518
They went down like elevators;
we got on them.

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:08.976
They went back up, and the Bedouin,
each Bedouin, four of them,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.976
got behind each of the camels
with a little whip.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.976
And they started slashing away
at the back of the camels,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.292
and they started galloping.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:19.793
And if you've ever been on a camel,
it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
There's also one other aspect
about these camels.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.976
About every 10 steps, they lean back

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.976
and try to take a chunk out of your leg.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.079
(Laughter)

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:29.976
So we kept on going,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.976
and this camel kept on trying
to take a chunk out of my leg.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.134
And eventually, three miles later,
we arrived at our destination,

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:37.976
where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.317
And the camels come down
again like elevators,

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.976
we sort of clumsily get off,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.976
and they, obviously, try to take
another chunk out of my leg.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.976
And I've developed
a very wonderful relationship

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.976
with this creature by this point,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I've realized
that this is a mean son of a bitch.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
And much meaner, by the way,
than the Bedouin who greeted me

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.540
and tried to sell me
one of his 26 daughters

00:03:59.564 --> 00:04:01.540
to take back to the States.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.874
So as we talked, Richard and I,

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:06.159
I said, "You know, maybe
I should bring a camel.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:08.416
It's the best designed
animal in the world."

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.324
He went, "Nah. I don't think
we want to be bringing a camel."

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:14.485
And you should be really glad
we decided not to bring the camel.

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.000
So I did the next best thing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.961
I went to the Washington Zoo.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:23.338
Richard said, "I want you to get up
close and personal with this camel.

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.513
I want you to inspect its mouth,
look at its teeth.

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.976
Go underneath it.
Go above it. Go around it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.533
Pull its tail up; take a look in there.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.976
I want you to get as close
to that camel as you possibly can."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.246
So, I got a National Geographic film crew.

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:43.172
We went down there,
and I took one look at this camel.

00:04:44.382 --> 00:04:48.976
It is a 2,000 pound creature
who is in rut.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.794
(Laughter)

00:04:51.818 --> 00:04:54.675
Now, if you've ever seen
a 2,000 pound camel in rut,

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.936
it is a scary, scary thing to behold.

00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:01.523
And if Richard thought I was getting
in the ring with that camel,

00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:03.976
someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.182
(Laughter)

00:05:05.206 --> 00:05:08.976
So we got as close to it as possible,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.342
and I'm going to share this.

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:12.135
Chris, if you want to roll this film.

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.413
Then I'm going to show you

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:15.533
a little bit more
about the design of camels.

00:05:15.557 --> 00:05:16.938
Do you want to roll the film?

00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:19.342
(Adventure music)

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:53.941
(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:57.459
with the TED National Geographic
Camel Investigation Unit.

00:05:57.483 --> 00:06:00.483
I'm here to look
at the ultimate desert machine.

00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:03.297
(Music continues)

00:06:07.912 --> 00:06:10.405
Keith Bellows: And you'll note
I started chewing gum

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.405
because I was around this camel all day.

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:14.543
(Video) That's it, OK. No!

00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:17.657
See, now he's getting
a little overexcited.

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:21.256
So we'll need to be very careful
around him. Don't let him get you.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:47.356
Now, you can see copious amounts
of saliva in there.

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:53.400
I always called myself
the unstable stable boy.

00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:57.075
Their nose, you can see
his nose is flared right now.

00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:00.747
When they're in rut,
they're similar to seals

00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.771
in the way, like, a seal has
to open its nose to breathe.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.963
And they're similar.
They have to consciously open their nose.

00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:09.988
KB: Ears?

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:13.581
SK: They are small.
But they have excellent hearing.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.071
But not big; for instance,
in zebras, they have a huge ear

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:23.976
that's very mobile, so they can
actually turn them both around.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.976
And they use them in the same way
we use our binocular vision.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.976
They use that to pinpoint sound.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.157
The desert's extremely windy
as well as being very cold.

00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:38.652
So not only do they have
the very long eyelashes,

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:40.535
but there's the secondary --

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:43.976
I guess you'd call it
the [unclear] or whatever.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.976
It's this hair that's above the eyes,
and below it, it's longer.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.976
Most people think
that the humps store water.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.673
They don't. They store fat.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.976
Now, I'm not a chemist,
but basically what happens

00:08:01.603 --> 00:08:07.289
is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.

00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:12.373
And that will turn it
into actually usable water.

00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:14.976
Like a lot of predators,
they walk on their toes.

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:19.976
But there's a big fat pad
in there that squishes out.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.976
They're like sun shoes,
but, you know, with sand.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.976
Hooves? They don't have
traditional hooves,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.960
but they do have one, like, big nail.

00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:33.278
(Audience laughter)

00:08:33.302 --> 00:08:36.279
You can't really see too clear.
The fur's kind of grown over.

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:39.279
But they use their tails a lot,
especially in rut.

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:45.976
He will urinate and spin his tail
to spread the urine around

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.976
and make him more attractive.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.096
I don't know why that would be,
but it works for them.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.615
So, what the hell.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.976
(Audience laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.769
Now, they will also defecate
in certain areas.

00:08:59.793 --> 00:09:02.368
Generally, they poop
wherever they want to,

00:09:02.392 --> 00:09:08.906
but during their rut,
they will defecate in perimeter areas.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.976
I don't know if you've read or heard
about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.976
you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.976
These big, big rumbling sounds.
He will do the same thing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.887
You can actually see,
right here, it will vibrate.

00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:25.809
We weigh our animals.

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:29.976
Unfortunately,
he's a very aggressive animal,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.976
so he's actually destroyed
some of the scales.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.048
We had these big things that I weigh
the bison on, for instance.

00:09:36.072 --> 00:09:39.796
I'm guessing that
he's at least 1,600 pounds.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.976
But I would put him closer to 2,000.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.391
He's basically a walking mulch pile.

00:09:44.415 --> 00:09:47.517
We're kind of like buds,
but I'm also a male as well.

00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:50.444
KB: He sees you as competition?
Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:50.468 --> 00:09:52.976
And it makes him very dangerous
at this time of year.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.976
Don't even think about it.
Don't think about it!

00:09:59.034 --> 00:10:01.642
But now, we're going to meet. Out!

00:10:02.714 --> 00:10:05.000
Out! Out!

00:10:06.927 --> 00:10:07.928
No.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.043
Out!

00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:14.442
(Music)

00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:35.976
(Applause)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
KB: What I didn't show you was,
you got that swinging thing going?

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:43.778
Well, and you're glad
I didn't show you this.

00:10:44.422 --> 00:10:47.176
One of the other things
about the camel's beautiful design

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.176
is that its penis points backwards.

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:53.438
That way the camel can dip
its tail in the stream,

00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:56.976
and just whacker
the entire area around him.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.096
And that's how
he really marks his territory.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.976
Now, what you also didn't see was that --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.976
and you may have noticed
in the pen beside him

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.

00:11:07.778 --> 00:11:09.572
In the pen beside him is Jasmine.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.246
Jasmine has been his mate for some time.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.376
But on this particular occasion,
it was very, very clear

00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:20.186
that as horny as Suki was,
Jasmine was having none of it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.976
And so we started thinking.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.899
Well, if poor old Suki
is in search of a mate,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.778
what would Suki do to find
the perfect mate?

00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:31.475
I'm going to show you another film.

00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:33.547
But before I do, I just want to mention

00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:37.976
that this animal truly is a sort
of the SUV of the sand,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.426
the ship of the desert.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.976
It's so vital to the inhabitants
of the areas

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.722
in which the camel is found,
largely Mongolia and Sahara,

00:11:48.746 --> 00:11:53.926
that there are 160 words
in Arabic to describe the camel.

00:11:54.293 --> 00:11:56.976
And if this is a creature
that was designed by committee,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.976
it's certainly been
like no committee I've ever been on.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.365
So here's what Suki would do
in search of a mate.

00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:08.024
Can you roll it, please?

00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:09.528
Camel seeking camel

00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:12.493
Lusty beast desires
attractive and sincere mate.

00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:15.874
I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs.,
with brown hair and eyes, long legs --

00:12:15.898 --> 00:12:17.267
and I'm very well ... hung.

00:12:22.483 --> 00:12:23.976
I'm TED Camel.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:26.159
The perfect desert machine.

00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:30.278
I'm smartly designed.

00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.435
Eyelashes that keep out sand

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:35.254
and a third eyelash that works
like a windshield wiper.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
A distinguished nose --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.239
with nostrils lined
to filter out sand and dust

00:12:44.883 --> 00:12:46.923
and a groove that catches moisture.

00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:49.548
Amazingly full lips --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.524
that allow me to eat practically
anything that grows.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Callouses on my knees
that let me kneel comfortably.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.976
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Short fur that keeps my skin cool.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.141
Long legs that allow heat to escape.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.510
And my hump?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.976
Ogden Nash once wrote:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.239
"The camel has a single hump;
the dromedary two,

00:13:22.263 --> 00:13:24.976
or else the other way around.
I'm never sure. Are you?"

00:13:25.899 --> 00:13:26.976
Here's a hint:

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.976
Bactarian.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Dromedary.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:36.692
My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat,
but doesn't store H2O.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm built to last.

00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:45.540
I'm the go-to animal
when the oasis is dry.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.381
I usually won't sweat
until my body reaches 105 ºF,

00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:51.115
enough to fry an egg.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.976
I'm able to lose 40%
of my weight without dying.

00:13:57.249 --> 00:14:00.000
(Most animals would
if they lost half that much.)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.590
I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons
of water a day.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.976
But go without for more than a month.

00:14:09.714 --> 00:14:11.406
I'm powerful.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.430
Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Outrun a horse --

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:21.785
And cover 26 miles on a good day.

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:25.976
Camelot.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.048
Jackie O. once said
that traveling by camel

00:14:28.072 --> 00:14:31.072
made riding an elephant seem
like taking a jet plane.

00:14:34.952 --> 00:14:37.372
Yet my large, soft feet
allow me to navigate sand.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
(Is that why the Bedouin
claim I can dance?)

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.976
I'm a good provider, too.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.976
Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.

00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.880
No surprise.

00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:52.976
Tents and rugs are made of my hair.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.143
My dried bones are prized
as a sort of ivory.

00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.739
My dung is burned as fuel.
My milk is used for cheese.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:00.596
"Camels are like angels,"
a Bedouin once said.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.579
(Applause)

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:07.976
Thank you. I just want to leave you
with one last thought,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.837
which is probably the most important
thing to take away.

00:15:12.722 --> 00:15:18.484
Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky
creatures because, by and large,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.976
we really don't have
to adapt to our environment;

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.976
we adapt our environment to us.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.976
And we've seen that repeatedly
through this conference,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.976
not just this year, but in past years.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.275
But this creature that you've just seen

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.834
ultimately adapts,
and keeps adapting and adapting.

00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:37.976
I think when you look
at the animal kingdom,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that is one of the most remarkable things.

00:15:40.024 --> 00:15:42.910
It doesn't have an environment
that adapts to it;

00:15:42.934 --> 00:15:44.730
it has to adapt to the environment.

00:15:44.754 --> 00:15:46.729
Ricky, thank you very much for having me.

00:15:46.753 --> 00:15:48.230
RW: That's terrific. Thank you.
