WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One is what's on the Boston Public Library.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Carved above their door is, "Free to All."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's kind of an inspiring statement,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and I'll go back at the end of this.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to as many people as want to read it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
everything that was ever meant for distribution,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and that's still being refigured out.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
so we can actually achieve that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But I'm going to go over the technological, social

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If you wanted to put all of the published works online

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That's pretty neat.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Then the question is, what do you get?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You know, is it worth trying to get there?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Do you actually want it online?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that look a whole lot like books in certain ways,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
still very book-like -- on your laptop.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I like the physical book.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
put them on the Net, and then download,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
print them and bind them, and end up with books again.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And it turns out to not be very hard.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And they actually come out kind of nice looking.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You can actually get really good-looking books

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
putting books back in people's hands again.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
There are some other bookmobiles running around.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
for competing with the bookstore there.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It was quite popularly attended.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And kids starting to make their own books,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So the idea of being able to use this technology

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
but I think it still has its place.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
sort of world,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
we might have something.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There are some newer technologies for delivering

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is some of these new little screens that are coming out.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So here's one of the beta units and you can --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and it turns out that 200 dots per inch

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We're in good enough shape.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But how do you go about doing all this scanning?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
especially if they're valuable books.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because you could just buy another one,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But do things that you love.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
about 300,000 now -- doing very well.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
so that it's a cost point that we could afford?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
we would have achieved something.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
sort of these auto-page-turning things.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you can go and get the proper intonation.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
as you're going through these libraries.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
People seem to love it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Laughter)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in languages that you can read.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And what we've been able to do is get into libraries.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and libraries are up for having their books scanned.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
which is where we have one these scanning centers,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We've scanned about 200,000 books.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So all in all, that's going very well.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
into the out-of-print world.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and have the classic thing that you have,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that are starting to participate in this program,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to try out this model of where does a library stop

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and where does the bookstore take over.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and we've got about 250,000 books online,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And then, there's business model issues

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
at least for the out of print and out of copyright,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So how much is there?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or at least that's the largest archives of published materials

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
we've been able to sort of point at.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and put it online, if you're doing things in volume.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
This is a fairly heavily litigated area,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
so we've found that there are niches in the music world

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And we've been starting to make these available by going

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and offering shelf space on the Net.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
If you give something to a charity or to the public,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
except on the Net, where you can go broke.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you can lose your guitars or your house.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This doesn't make any sense.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
as long as nobody made any money. You could --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We've got a lot of collections now --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
there are not that many of them.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But half of those were Indian.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But anyway, it's doable,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to be out of copyright.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So we've digitized those and made those available.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We're not quite a YouTube.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We tended towards longer-term things

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
which has just been great fun.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Television comes quite a bit larger.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
24 hours a day.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We only put one week up,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and being able to compare what happened in the past?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and have them up on the Net.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
But we've worked through some of those,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
but we've still got real problems in Washington.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And we've made a Wayback Machine

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
the different versions of it that we have,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and this is what it looked like at Stanford.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
which is probably best known for burning,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
is, don't just have one copy.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
so we're hedging our bets here.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
There's a political and social question out of this.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
There's some large companies that have seen this vision,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that are doing large-scale digitization,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
but they're locking up the public domain.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So universal access to all knowledge --

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
It could be something that we're remembered for,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
for millennia, for having achieved.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And as I said before, I'll end with something

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
carved above his legacy, "Free to the People."

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Thank you very much.
