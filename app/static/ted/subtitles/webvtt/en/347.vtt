00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"I gotta call my mother."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You still with me? (Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I called her up.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to the White House."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Ma, don't start!"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"What's the problem?"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it's entertainment when you tell it,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and you're going to use a microphone."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
(Laughter)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Laughter)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Then my pop got on there.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
old Cuban man from Camaguey.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He's from Florida.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He was born there in 1924.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
our old Arawak ancestors.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"Papi, help."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
"After what I just told you?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
My whole life, my father's been there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I love that, but we don't have the time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Great story is the art of letting go.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I'm going to tell you a little story.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Remember, this tradition comes to us

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Have you been watching the commercials?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to tell our story and have it heard.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
There are stories you tell from stages.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There's stories that you may tell

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in a small group of people with some good wine.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
maybe once in your life.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm not telling you that story.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm telling you this one.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's about human connection.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in that short character sketch,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
came to the United States one thousand years ago.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And in that little Southern town, I grew up,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and grew up hearing these stories.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But this story only happened a few years ago.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I called my mom.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It was a Saturday morning.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's delicious. It's savory.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That kind of food, yeah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
This is the sensory part of the program, people.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I got an errand to run."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Spanish)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
"You don't speak English?"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
"No."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But eventually, every dog has its day,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and she ended up in traffic court,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
where she bartered with the judge for a discount.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
There's a historical marker.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to take her to have her hair dyed, you know,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you know, same color as the Buick.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Anybody? All right.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Rockports -- they're for this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
That's why they call them that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
This is her ensemble.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I show up. She's in the carport.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Of course, they have a carport.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The Buick's parked outside,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
"We taking your car?"

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
"Not we, I."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Blithering fucking idiots.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Laughter)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I said, "Is that thing real?"

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
"I think so."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
"Can you even see?"

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
"I guess I must."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
"Oh, Jesus."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"You coming? You no coming?"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
"Are you kidding me?"

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
"How are you doing it?"

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"He's got to sleep sometime."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
birth breathing -- you know, that one?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And there she goes, right.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
"No, no, what you talking about?"

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
"Four or five days."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
"I did not get a ticket."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
"OK, so I stopped at a light

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and there's a guy, you know, in the back."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and a terrified look on his face?"

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
"You weren't there, don't start."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
"Come on. You got a ticket?"

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
"No." She explained,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
because it loses something if I don't, you know --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which tells me he's pretty old, you know.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So I look up and I'm thinking,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
"Ma, are you still doing that?"

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
"If it works, it works, baby.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
(Laughter)

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
"Yeah? What?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You should be terrified.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but by now, we've reached the mall.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Audience: Yes.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
praying to that saint of perpetual availability

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
some guy's going to turn on the brake lights

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
just as you pull up behind him.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
"You mean, like, in the car?"

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"No, don't -- why are we here today?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
this woman's mind.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But you know.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Laughter)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
"It will upset you."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and he's supposed to buy the boxers."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
"Why?"

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"Oh, my God!"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Laughter)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Olivia? Huh? Huh?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
By now, we have now crawled another four feet,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and three -- three -- aisles down,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
"Look, the Chevy."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You want to laugh, but you don't know --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and go stand in the parking space till I get there."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
(Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We're doing great. We're doing fine.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Well, I stood up to her.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
(Spanish)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
hits the emergency brake, opens the door,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and then she walks around --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
around the front of the car.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I start, and this is where a child says to me --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because this is my laconic child.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
You know, she eats small portions.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Language is something to be meted out

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
She wields great power.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But she pauses occasionally and says,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
"How do you spell that? What year? OK."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
When she writes the expose in about 20 years,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
don't believe a word of it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
my borderline Asperger's kid.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Bless you, Dr. Watson.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I grew up with this woman.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
"No, mama, you got to look."

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I got to look. You got to look.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Don't you want to look?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
There she is.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I look in bewildered awe:

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Laughter)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Honey, sit up so they can see you."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I don't know what part of the country you live in.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I think we all secretly love stories.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Come on, honey, tell it to me."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But in the South, we love a good story.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
People have pulled aside,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I mean, they've come out of that queue line,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Bets are placed.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
(Laughter)

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
She is, after all, Cuban.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I pull in. I put the car in park.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
"I'm not going anywhere."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I come out, and there's Esther.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
She's hugging the purse.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
(Laughter)

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
"Ma, have you no shame?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
People are watching us all around," right?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Secret of the trade.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
She says this to me.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
After I say -- let me refresh you --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
"have you no shame?"

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
(Applause)

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Intrepid soul.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
She jumped out of that car."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
(Laughter)

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
"is that your mother?"

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
she reminds us of our mother."

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I almost miss it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
lost in their own reverie.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
"You know what, honey?"

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
"What, ma?"

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(Applause)
