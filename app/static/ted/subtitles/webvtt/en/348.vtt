WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I've been doing it for two years,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
trying to change how we feed kids in America.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Everyone says it couldn't be done.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
like, what my vision would be.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
How do we really change children's relationship to food?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I'll tell you why we need to change it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but we absolutely have to change it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And what I came to understand is,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we needed to teach children

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the symbiotic relationship

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
although we've heard otherwise,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is we're really going to become extinct,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because we're feeding our children to death.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's my premise.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the reason this is happening, by and large,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is because of our food system

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the way the government commodifies food,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the way the government oversees our food,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and tell them to learn, you know,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
learn what's in those schools.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And when you feed these kids bad food,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
These are -- 10 companies

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
control much of what's in our grocery stores,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So when I started thinking about these issues

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and how I was going to change what kids ate,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I really started focusing on what we would teach them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the very first thing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
was about regional food -- trying to eat food

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from within our region.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as oil hits its peak oil,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we should, or could, be moving food

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
1,500 miles before we eat it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So we talked to kids about that,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and we really start to feed kids regional food.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then we talk about organic food.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but we, as a nation,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
have to start thinking about

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
consuming, growing and feeding our children

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
food that's not chock-full of chemicals.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We can't keep doing that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You know, it doesn't work.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And the results of that are kids getting sick.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is consumed in animal husbandry.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We are feeding our kids antibiotics

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in beef and other animal protein every day.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And the result of it is, we have diseases.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that we can't make kids better when they get sick.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but it's an issue in the food supply.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
One of my favorite facts is that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That means every one of us, and our children,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
those bags you have at home. If I had one here

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and ripped it open,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and that pile I would have on the floor

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is what we consume and feed our children every year

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because of what goes into our food supply,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because of the way we consume

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
produce in America.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The USDA allows these antibiotics,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the USDA paid for this ad

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in Time magazine.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but we know it wasn't good for you and me.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And that has to change, you know.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The USDA cannot be seen as

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the be-all and end-all of what we feed

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
our kids and what's allowed.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
That's what I really try and get people to understand.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It's consuming food in a way

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in which we'll still have a planet,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in which kids will grow up to be healthy,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and which really tries to mitigate

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
all the negative impacts we're seeing.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It really is just a new idea.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I mean, people toss around sustainability,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but we have to figure out what sustainability is.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we've gone from being 200 --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to less than 2 percent of farmers.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And we spend 35,000 dollars

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and school districts spend 500 dollars a year

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
feeding a child.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Laughter)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And what's happening is, we're getting sick.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It is about what we feed them.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
What goes in is what we are.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We really are what we eat.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And if we continue down this path,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
if we continue to feed kids bad food,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
if we continue not to teach them what good food is,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
What's going to happen to our whole medical system?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
What's going to happen is,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
we're going to have kids

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that have a life less long than our own.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
those seven- and eight-year-olds today --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
one out of every three Caucasians,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
most before they graduate high school.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
This means that 40 or 45 percent

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of all school-aged children

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
could be insulin-dependent

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
within a decade. Within a decade.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
What's going to happen?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Well, the CDC has gone further to say

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that those children born in the year 2000

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
could be the first generation

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And it's because of what we feed them.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and if they do, you should be in therapy.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You know, we are responsible

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
for what kids eat.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They spend 500 dollars

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
marketing healthy, nutritious food.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The result of which is kids think they're going to die

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
if they don't have chicken nuggets.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is what McDonald's and Burger King

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and those big companies think we should eat.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And why can they serve that much?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and 99-cent double burgers?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It's because of the way the government commodifies food,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and the cheap corn and cheap soy

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that are pushed into our food supply

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that makes these non-nutrient foods

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
really, really cheap.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is not even food.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
corn dogs,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
it came frozen in a box.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The USDA allows this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The USDA allows all of this stuff.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
In case you can't tell, that's, like,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And we, all of us,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
have to understand

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that this is about us,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that we can make a difference here.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
but I'm sure you're rich if you did.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
a heart, a giraffe, a star?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And that they could figure it out,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that we could sell this stuff to kids.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that chicken looks like chicken?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But this is what most schools serve.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We really need to change

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
this whole paradigm with kids and food.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We really have to teach children

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that chicken is not a giraffe.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You know, that vegetables

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
are actually colorful, that they have flavor,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that carrots grow in the ground,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that strawberries grow in the ground.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You know, we have to change

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
the way we teach kids about these things.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
actually getting fresh food into schools.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We have no high-fructose corn syrup,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
no trans fats, no processed foods.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
We're cooking from scratch every day.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We have 25 percent of our --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(Applause)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
is organic and local. We cook.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
every day and go cook the food for the kids,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
because this is what we need to do.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We can't keep serving kids

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
processed crap,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
full of chemicals,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You're not going to get the next generation,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
or the generation after, to be able to think like this

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
if they're not nourished.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
If they're eating

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
chemicals all the time,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they're not going to be able to think.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
They're not going to be smart.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You know what? They're just going to be sick.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
very, very different, and I needed to market it.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And these calendars really started to lay out my program.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and all the gardening classes in our school district.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So this is a typical menu.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And you see these recipes on the side?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If we're going to change children's relationship to food,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and academic curriculum to tie it all together.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This is available on my website in English and Spanish,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We have to start changing this.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We have to make kids understand

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that their food choices make a big difference.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And why this is so important is

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that we now have grown a generation,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What are kids learning? Where is the family time?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Where is socialization? Where is discussion?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Where is learning to talk?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You know, we have to change it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We have to teach kids

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that Coke and Pop Tarts

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
aren't breakfast.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
of refined sugar,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We have recycling in all of our schools.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You know, the things that we maybe do at home

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and think are so important,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we have to teach kids about in school.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It has to be so much a part of them

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that they really get it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Because, you know what, many of us

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
are sort of at the end of our careers,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and we need to be giving these kids --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
these young kids, the next generation --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
the tools to save themselves

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and save the planet.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I work with private companies

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
who are willing to do R &amp; D with me,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
who are willing to do distribution for me,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
who are really willing to work to go into schools.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Schools are underfunded.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Most schools in America spend less

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
That comes down to under five dollars an hour.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
for babysitters when you have them.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And if we're going to change it,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and change how we feed kids,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
we really have to rethink that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So, public and private partnerships,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
advocacy groups, working with foundations.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
In our school district, the way we afford this

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
is our school district allocates .03 percent

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
of the general fund

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
allocated a half to one percent,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
we could start to really fix this program.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We really need to change it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It's going to take more money.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
kids getting exercise.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And one of the simple things we can do

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is put recess before lunch.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It's sort of this "duh" thing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We need to --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
we need to educate.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We need to educate the kids.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We need to educate the staff.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I had 90 employees.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And, you know, I'm not that better off now.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But we really have to educate.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
about ways to teach people how to cook again,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
because, of course, they don't --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
because we've had this processed food in schools

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and institutions for so long.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We need 40-minute lunches --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
most schools have 20-minute lunches --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and lunches that are time-appropriate.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
There was just a big study done, and so many schools

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
That is not lunchtime.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And just remember,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
at very least tacitly,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
this is what we're teaching children

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
as what they should be doing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I think if we're going to fix this,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
one of the things we have to do

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
is really change how we have oversight

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
over the National School Lunch Program.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I think it should be under CDC.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
If we started to think about food

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and how we feed our kids

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
as a health initiative,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and we started thinking about food as health,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
as lunch.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Okay, Finance 101 on this,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
because I think this is something we all have to understand.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
feeding 30 million children a year.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
That number probably needs to double.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
on fast food.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
We spend 100 billion dollars a year

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
on diet aids.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
which is why we need all the diet aids.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
We spend 200 billion dollars a year

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
on diet-related illness today,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
200 billion.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So you know what, when we talk

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that's what the government allocates for lunch.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That means we spend less than a dollar a day

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
on food for kids in schools --

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Now I don't know about you,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
One gourmet coffee,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
one, is more --

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
for an entire week

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
in our schools.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You know what? We should be ashamed.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
We, as a country, should be ashamed

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
at that.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
The richest country.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
In our country,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
it's the kids that need it the most,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
who get this really, really lousy food.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
It's the kids who have parents and grandparents

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and uncles and aunts that can't even afford

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
to pay for school lunch that gets this food.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And those are the same kids

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
who are going to be getting sick.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
We can all make a difference.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
That every single one of us,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
whether we have children,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
or anything --

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
that we can make a difference.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
or nieces and nephews shopping

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Sit down and care.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And on the macro level,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
we're in what seems to be

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
a 19-month presidential campaign,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and of all the things we're asking

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
all of these potential leaders,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
what about asking for the health of our children?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Thank you.
