WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Laughter)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But it slightly bores me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and why Francis and I found it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
what makes me tick now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
let you in after two years of high school.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or anything like that.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Laughter)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And my mother was Irish Catholic,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and going on birdwatching walks with my father.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I guess, you know, he was the big hero.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but what was the essence of life?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And Schrodinger said the essence was information

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and somehow all the information was probably present

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in some digital form. And there was the big question

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of, how did you copy the information?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So that was the book. And so, from that moment on,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I wanted to be a geneticist --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
understand the gene and, through that, understand life.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So I went to Indiana,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And it was at Indiana I got the impression

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
maybe I could become a biochemist,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You can read it in about two hours.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and he talked about DNA.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Most people believed it was proteins.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and he showed this x-ray photograph.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
even though it owed it to probably different molecules

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
carrying different sets of instructions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and I ended up in Cambridge, England.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I went to Cambridge,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because it was really the best place in the world then

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in, you know, chemistry departments.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So the best place for x-ray crystallography

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And there I met Francis Crick.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And within a day, we had decided that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
he banished the man out on the right,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is a photograph several years later,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
when Bragg had cause to smile.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So we built a three-stranded model.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The people from London came up.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
They said it was lousy, and it was.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Laughter)

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And so we didn't build any models,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And we kept telling the people in London

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And, in fact, he'd written the people in London:

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Could he see their x-ray photograph?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But there was ones in the literature.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
between phosphate groups.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And so Bragg said, "Build models."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and that they should immediately start building models.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and after she left he would start building models.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and Bragg said, "Build models."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Well, of course, I wanted to build models.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in one sense she was a chemist,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but really she would have been trained --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
She was a crystallographer.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We weren't the best chemists in the room.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I just put them down like they were in the books.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
He said they were wrong.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right."

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And we knew we were right.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
From nothing to thing.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So we saw how genetic information is carried.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It's the order of the four bases.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And you copy it by going from strand-separating.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
because you didn't have any other scheme.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But that's not the way most scientists think.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Most scientists are really rather dull.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So think about it. The next five years,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
there were essentially something like five references

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to our work in "Nature" -- none.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And so we were left by ourselves,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
what does this genetic information do?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Laughter)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
so I'm still looking happy.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Laughter)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But there is what we did when we didn't know

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He was one of the members. The question was:

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
How do you go from a four-letter code

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to the 20-letter code of proteins?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There's Francis up on the upper right,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so I didn't really get happy until 1960,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
because then we found out, basically, you know,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that there are three forms of RNA.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
RNA provides the information for protein.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and it was all over by 1966.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so what happened since then?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, at that time -- I should go back.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
because you couldn't. No use for it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
At least they patented something

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which, you know, could do useful things.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
but we were still a long ways from, you know,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
which is: How do you nature-nurture?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
turned physicist. And he developed a technique

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
which essentially will let us look at sample DNA

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and, eventually, a million spots along it.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
made by a photolithography by a company in Madison

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And we use their technique.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And you can see on the top

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So the DNA is really badly mucked up,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
whereas if you have a chance of surviving,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the DNA isn't so mucked up.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
you should really look at this technique,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I think it's going to be very, very useful.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So, we started with breast cancer

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
because there's lots of money for it, no government money.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And now I have a sort of vested interest:

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and made a really sort of surprising observation.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
where we've lost a gene or gained another one.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
if we're around here, you know,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
these little losses or gains might not be too bad.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
maybe we'll feel sick.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So the first disease he looked at is autism.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
we began to find genes for autism.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And you can see here, there are a lot of them.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
because they just lost a big piece of DNA.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We saw one autistic kid,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
to help parents who've had an autistic child,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
or think they may have an autistic child,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and can we spot the difference?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So this same technique should probably look at all.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
It's a wonderful way to find genes.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And so, I'll conclude by saying

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
before we got the picture. But as you can see,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And yet, in the controls there were three.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So what's the meaning of the controls?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and whether this is one that predisposes --

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and then there's only a sub-segment of the population

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
that's capable of being schizophrenic.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Now, we don't have really any evidence of it,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Now, some people who think they're right-handed

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
(Laughter)

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
there's a relationship.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I thank you.
