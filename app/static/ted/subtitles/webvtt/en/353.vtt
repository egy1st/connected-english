WEBVTT

00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:01.485
Good morning.

00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:02.769
My name is David Rose.

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:06.349
I am a serial entrepreneur
turned serial investor.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.969
And by the use of pitching
PowerPoints to VCs,

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:12.469
I have personally raised
tens of millions of dollars

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:15.363
from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:17.565
And turning to the other side
of the equation,

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.005
I've personally supervised the investment
of tens of millions of dollars

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.096
into companies who have pitched me
with PowerPoint presentations.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.445
So I think it's safe to say

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.121
I know a little bit
about the process of pitching.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.777
So, the very first question
you've got to figure out is:

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:34.459
What is the single most important
thing that a VC is looking for

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:37.601
when you come to them
pitching your new business idea?

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.630
There are obviously all kinds of things --

00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:42.536
business models and financials
and markets and this and that.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.766
Overall, of all the things
that you have to do,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.697
what is the single most important thing

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.697
the VC is going to be investing in?

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:50.976
Somebody? What?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.154
Audience: People!

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:55.881
David Rose: People! You!
That's it -- you are the person.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:59.781
Therefore, the entire purpose
of a VC pitch is to convince them

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:03.399
that you are the entrepreneur in whom
they are going to invest their money

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:05.313
and make a lot of money in return.

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:06.504
Now, how do you do this?

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:08.028
You can't just walk up and say,

00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:11.996
"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,
and you should invest in me." Right?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.594
So in the course of your VC pitch --
you have a very few minutes;

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:18.731
most VC pitches, angel pitches,
are about 15 minutes,

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.175
most should be less than half an hour --

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:24.117
people's attention span,
after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.

00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:25.292
Tests have shown.

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:27.511
So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:30.471
you have to convey a whole bunch
of different characteristics,

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.557
about 10 different characteristics,

00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:34.074
while you're standing up there.

00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:37.712
What's the single most important thing
you've got to convey? What?

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:38.930
Audience: Integrity.

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.153
DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:41.963
That's a straight line, look at that!

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:43.384
And I didn't even prompt him.

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:45.336
Right, integrity. The key thing.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.368
I would much rather invest in,
take a chance on,

00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:52.019
somebody who I know is straight
than where there's any possible question

00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:54.541
of who are they looking out for,
and what's going on.

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.549
So the most important thing is integrity.

00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.667
What's the second most important thing?

00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.317
Let's see if you can get this one.

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:01.647
Audience: Self-confidence.

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:02.976
DR: Close enough. Passion.

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:07.531
Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition,
are people who are leaving something else,

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:11.237
starting a new world, creating and putting
their lifeblood into this thing.

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.646
You've got to convey passion.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.973
If you're not passionate,

00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:17.149
why should anyone else be,
or put money into your company

00:02:17.173 --> 00:02:18.864
if you're not passionate about it?

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.196
Integrity, passion:
the most important things.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.401
Then there's a whole panoply
of other things you've got to wrap up

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.615
in this package you're presenting to a VC.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.693
Experience: you've got to be able to say,

00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:30.875
"Hey, you know, I've done this before."

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.935
"Done this before" is starting
an enterprise, creating value,

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.968
and taking something
from beginning to end.

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:38.507
That's why VCs love to fund
serial entrepreneurs --

00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:40.683
even if you didn't do it right
the first time,

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:44.046
you've learned the lessons, which puts
you in good stead the next time.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.623
Along with the experience of starting
an enterprise or running something --

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:49.093
doesn't have to be a business,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:51.823
it can be an organization
in a school, a not-for-profit.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:53.901
But experience
in creating an organization.

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:55.076
Next: knowledge.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.251
If you tell me

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.306
you're going to be the developer
of the map of the human genome,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.720
you better know what a human genome is;
I want you to have expertise.

00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:04.229
I don't want somebody who says,

00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:06.976
"I've got a great idea
in a business I know nothing about.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.779
I don't know who the players are,
what the market is like."

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:11.819
You've got to know your market, your area.

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:13.946
And you have to have
the skills that it takes

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.120
to get a company going.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:18.217
Those skills include
everything from technical skills

00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:19.963
if it's a technology business,

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:22.761
to marketing and sales
and management and so on.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.467
But, you know, not everybody
has all these skills.

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:29.186
Very few people have the full set
of skills it takes to run a company.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.237
What else do you require?
Well, leadership.

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:34.767
You've got to be able to convince us
that you either have developed a team

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.615
that has all those factors
in it, or else you can.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.070
And you have the charisma
and the management style

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:42.873
and the ability to get people
to follow your lead,

00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:46.185
to inspire them, to motivate them
to be part of your team.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.757
Having done all that,

00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:49.502
what else do I want to know as a VC?

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:51.621
I want to know that you have commitment.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.606
That you are going to be here to the end.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.252
I want you to say --
or I want you to convey --

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:59.900
that you are going to die if you
have to, with your very last breath,

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:02.250
your fingernails scratching
as they draw you out.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.750
You'll keep my money alive
and make more from it.

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:07.832
I don't want someone who'll
cut and run at the first opportunity.

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.007
Bad things happen.

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:12.572
There's never been a venture-funded
company where bad things didn't happen.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:14.741
So know that you're committed
to the very end.

00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:17.361
You've got to have vision
to see where this is going.

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:19.198
I don't want another "me too" product.

00:04:19.222 --> 00:04:21.648
I want somebody who can
change the world out there.

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:23.344
But on top of that, I need realism,

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:27.525
Because while changing the world
is great, it doesn't always happen.

00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:29.478
And before you get to change the world,

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.173
bad things are going to take place;

00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:32.525
you have to deal with that.

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:34.554
And you have to have rational projections.

00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:36.497
Finally, you're asking for my money --

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.955
not just because it's my money,
but because it's me.

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.175
You need to be coachable.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.350
I need to know
you have the ability to listen.

00:04:42.374 --> 00:04:43.814
We've had a lot of experience.

00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:47.117
People who are VCs or angels
investing in you have had experience,

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.141
and they'd like to know that you
want to hear that experience.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.521
So how do you convey these 10 things
in 10 minutes without saying them?

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:55.920
You can't say, "I've got
integrity, invest in me!"

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:59.266
You've got to do a whole pitch
that conveys this without conveying it.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.057
Think about your pitch as a timeline.

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.963
It starts off, you walk in the door.

00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:04.866
They know nothing whatsoever about you.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.521
You can take them on an emotional --
all pitches, all sales presentations,

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:09.911
are emotional at some level.

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.831
You can go up, you can go down, right?

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:13.479
And it goes from beginning to end.

00:05:13.503 --> 00:05:15.653
You walk in, the first thing
you've got to do,

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:19.047
the overall arc of your presentation,
it's got to start like a rocket.

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.806
You've got maybe 10 seconds --

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.990
between 10 and 30 seconds,
depending on how long the pitch is --

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.538
to get their attention.

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:27.008
In my case, I've invested.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.826
I've gotten millions of dollars
from PowerPoint pitches.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.709
"I've invested millions."
That should get you right there.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.047
This can be a fact
or something counterintuitive.

00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:36.770
It can be a story or an experience.

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:39.878
But you've got to grab
their emotional attention, focused on you,

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:41.378
within that first few seconds.

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:43.470
And then from there,
you've got to take them

00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:47.358
on a very solid, steady, upward path,
right from beginning to end.

00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:48.975
Everything has to reinforce this.

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.400
And you've got to get better
and better and better,

00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:52.796
revving up to the very end,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.327
then you've got to -- boom! --

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:55.653
knock them out of the park.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:57.836
You want to get them
to such an emotional high

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.440
they're ready to write you a check,
throw money at you,

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:01.615
before you leave.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.790
How do you do that?

00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:04.628
First of all, logical progression.

00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:08.011
Any time you go backwards,
any time you skip a step --

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.237
imagine walking up a staircase
where some of the treads are missing,

00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:12.977
or the heights are different.

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.894
You stop, you need to figure out
a nice, logical progression.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:19.142
Start with what the market is:
Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.857
And then you've got to tell me
how you're going to do it,

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.406
and what you're going to do.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.595
And it's got to flow
from beginning to end.

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.905
You've got to let me know
there are touchstones,

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.079
to tie in to the rest
of the world out there.

00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:33.401
For example, reference
companies I've heard of,

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:35.957
or basic items in your business.

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.734
I want to know about things
that I can relate to:

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:42.455
validators, or anything that tells me
somebody else has approved this,

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.182
or there's outside validation.

00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:47.230
It can be sales; it can be
you got an award for something;

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:49.952
it can be people have done it before;

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:52.956
it can be your beta tests
are going great, whatever.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.877
I want to know validation --
not just what you're telling me,

00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:58.000
but that somebody
or something else out there

00:06:58.024 --> 00:06:59.258
says this makes sense.

00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:02.349
And then, I'm looking for the upside;
I need a believable upside.

00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:04.999
That's two parts; it's got
to be upside and believable.

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:07.503
The upside means if you tell me
that five years out,

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:10.586
you're making a million dollars a year,
that's not really upside.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.191
Telling me you'll be making
a billion dollars a year --

00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:14.366
that's not believable.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.541
So it's got to be both.

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:18.586
On the other hand are things
that take the emotional level down.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.089
You have to recover from those.

00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:22.260
For example, anything
that I know is not true.

00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:25.008
"We have no competition.
Nobody makes a widget like this."

00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:27.136
Odds are I know somebody
who's made a widget,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.768
and the minute you tell me that,

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:31.420
I discount half of what
you're saying from then on.

00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:34.189
Anything I don't understand,

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:36.745
where I have to make the leap
myself, in my own head,

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:38.697
will stop the flow of the presentation.

00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:41.302
So you've got to take me
through like a sixth-grader --

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.389
dub, dub, dub --
but without patronizing me.

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:44.976
And it's a very tricky path.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.131
But if you can do it,
it works really well.

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:50.837
Anything that's inconsistent
within your concept --

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.537
if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z
are 10 million dollars,

00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:55.995
five slides later,
they're five million dollars ...

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.803
One may have been gross sales,
one may have been net sales,

00:07:58.827 --> 00:08:01.710
but I want to know that all the numbers
make sense together.

00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:04.273
And then, finally: anything
that's an error or a typo,

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:07.170
or a stupid mistake or a line
that's in the wrong place --

00:08:07.194 --> 00:08:10.823
that shows me that if you can't do
a presentation, how can you run a company?

00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:12.719
So this all feeds in together.

00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.096
The best way to do this
is to look at our betters,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.715
people who have done this before.

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:20.117
Let's look at the most successful
technology executive in the business,

00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:21.953
and see how a presentation goes.

00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:24.611
Bill Gates's PowerPoint
presentation over here.

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:26.683
Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.833
Is this how to do a PowerPoint
presentation? What do you think?

00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:32.540
No. Who do you think we should
look at as our role model?

00:08:32.564 --> 00:08:35.364
Oh, isn't that funny!
There's another great one over here.

00:08:35.388 --> 00:08:36.569
OK, Steve Jobs.

00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:40.079
You want absolute --
this is the Zen of presentation, right?

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.889
Here he is, one little guy,
black jeans and stuff,

00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:44.105
on a totally empty stage.

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:45.707
What are you focusing on?

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:47.780
You're focusing on him!
This is Steve Jobs.

00:08:47.804 --> 00:08:51.764
So are these wonderful long bullet points,
whole list of things good?

00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:54.319
No, they're not. The long
bullet points are bad.

00:08:54.343 --> 00:08:56.928
What's good? Short. Short bullet points.

00:08:56.952 --> 00:09:00.608
But you know what? Even better than short
bullet points are no bullet points.

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:01.877
Just give me the headline.

00:09:01.901 --> 00:09:03.052
And you know what?

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.100
How many bullet points
does Steve Jobs use?

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:06.495
Basically, none.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:07.671
What do you do?

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.531
Best of all, images. Just a simple image.

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:13.186
I look at the image;
a picture's worth a thousand words.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.694
You look at the image
and you've got the whole thing.

00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:19.152
Then you come back to me; you're focused
on me, why I'm such a great guy,

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:21.486
why you want to invest,
why this all makes sense.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.601
That said, we only have a very short time,

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.663
so let's run through the things
to include in your presentation.

00:09:26.687 --> 00:09:29.168
First of all, none of these big,
long-titled slides

00:09:29.192 --> 00:09:31.771
with blah, blah, I'm presenting
to so-and-so on X date.

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:34.517
I know the day, I know who I am --
I don't need all that.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:36.041
Just give me your company logo.

00:09:36.065 --> 00:09:38.272
I look at the logo,
and it ties it to my brain.

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:41.692
Then I come back to you.
I'm focused on you, OK?

00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:45.641
You give me your quick, 15-second
or 30-second intro, grab my attention.

00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:47.670
Then you give me
a quick business overview.

00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:50.821
This is not a five-minute pitch.
This is, you know, two sentences.

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:52.874
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."

00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:55.560
Or, "We sell services to help do X."
You know, whatever.

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:58.748
And that is like the picture
on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.

00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:00.229
That lets me know the context.

00:10:00.253 --> 00:10:03.505
It gives me the armature for the whole
thing you'll be going through;

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:06.391
it lets me put everything
in relation to what you've told me.

00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:10.697
Then you've got to walk me through,
show me who your management team is.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:14.270
I want to know the size of the market.
Why is this market worth getting at?

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:16.704
I want to know your product,
that's very important.

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:18.979
Now, this is not
a product pitch or sales pitch.

00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:22.196
I don't want to know all the ins and outs,
just what the heck is it?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.282
If it's a website, show me
a screenshot of your website.

00:10:25.306 --> 00:10:27.318
Don't do a live demo.
Never do a live demo.

00:10:27.342 --> 00:10:29.592
Do a canned demo,
or something that lets me know

00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:31.774
why people are going
to buy whatever it is.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.038
Now that I know what you're selling,

00:10:34.062 --> 00:10:35.637
tell me how you make money on it.

00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:40.143
For every X you sell, you get Y,
or services of Z.

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:43.113
I want to know what the business model
is on a per-unit basis,

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:45.097
or for the actual product you're selling.

00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:47.841
I want to know who you're selling to
in terms of customers

00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:50.751
and if you have any special
relationships that will help you,

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.785
whether it's a distribution relationship
or a producing partner.

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:54.960
Again, validation.

00:10:54.984 --> 00:10:58.235
This helps to say you're bigger
than just one little thing over here.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.695
But everybody has competition.

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:02.029
There's never been a company
with no competition,

00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:04.782
even if the competition
is the old way of doing something.

00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:07.086
I want to know exactly
what your competition is,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.177
and that will help me judge
how you fit into the whole operation.

00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.864
I want to know how you're special.

00:11:11.888 --> 00:11:13.610
I know what your competition does --

00:11:13.634 --> 00:11:16.309
how are you going to prevent
them from eating your lunch?

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.341
All this ties into the financial overview.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:21.293
And you can't do a VC pitch
without giving me your financials.

00:11:21.317 --> 00:11:24.823
I want to know a year or two back,
or as long as you've been in existence.

00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:27.092
And I want to know
four or five years forward.

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:28.745
Five is a bit much. Probably four.

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:31.735
And I want to know how that business
model, on a product basis,

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:34.963
will translate into a company model:
How many widgets will you sell?

00:11:34.987 --> 00:11:37.990
You make X amount per widget.
I want to know what the driver is.

00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:40.685
We'll have 1,000 customers
this year and 10,000 the next,

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:42.380
our revenues will do this and that.

00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:45.125
That gives me the whole picture
for the next several years

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:46.343
into which I'm investing.

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:49.428
And I want to know how the money
from me will help you get there.

00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:51.693
You're going to open
an offshore plant in China,

00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:54.156
you're going to spend it all
on sales and marketing,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.043
you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:58.883
But then comes the ask,
where you tell me how much you want.

00:11:58.907 --> 00:12:01.378
You're looking for 5 million --
at what valuation?

00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:03.612
Two million? 100,000?

00:12:03.636 --> 00:12:05.611
What's the money in so far? Who invested?

00:12:05.635 --> 00:12:09.622
I hope you invested -- if you can't invest
in your own thing, why should I?

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.936
So I like to know if you have
friends and family,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.825
or angel investors, or more VCs before.

00:12:13.849 --> 00:12:16.195
What's the capital structure
up until this point?

00:12:16.219 --> 00:12:19.323
Finally, having done all that,
you've now told me the whole thing,

00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:21.838
so now you bring it back
to that conclusion.

00:12:21.862 --> 00:12:23.258
This is that rocket going up.

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:25.152
Hopefully everything has been positive.

00:12:25.176 --> 00:12:27.623
And everything you say clicks,
it all makes sense.

00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:29.624
And I'm thinking, "This is really great!"

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:32.195
Then you take me back
to just your logo on the screen.

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.976
And I look at the logo -- OK, good.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.580
Now I come back to you.
Nothing else to look at, right?

00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:40.127
Now you've got to wrap it up
to give me the final -- boom! --

00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:42.540
the final pitch that's going
to send me into space.

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:44.616
Now, in the process of doing this,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.095
how do you remember
the sequences and do it?

00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:49.556
You've noticed I'm not looking
at the screen, right?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.142
The screen is in front of me,

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:52.977
so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.

00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:54.576
So how do I know what's going on?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.394
Well, I have a laptop in front of me.

00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:57.993
You're looking at me and at this.

00:12:58.017 --> 00:12:59.168
What am I looking at?

00:12:59.192 --> 00:13:00.864
You think that I'm looking at that?

00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:02.174
No, I'm looking, actually,

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.538
at a special version
of PowerPoint over here,

00:13:04.562 --> 00:13:07.268
which shows me the slides
ahead and behind, my notes,

00:13:07.292 --> 00:13:08.689
so I can see what's going on.

00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:11.687
PowerPoint has this built into
every copy of it that's shipped.

00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.530
If you use Apple's Keynote,
it's got an even better version.

00:13:14.554 --> 00:13:17.587
There's another program called
Ovation you can get from Adobe

00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:18.996
that they bought last summer,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.707
which helps you run the timers
and lets you figure out what's going on.

00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:25.289
So, here's my wrap-up
to take you to the moon, right?

00:13:25.313 --> 00:13:27.467
I usually do a Top 10,
but we don't have time,

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.380
so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.

00:13:29.404 --> 00:13:31.743
Number five: always use presenter mode,

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:34.140
or Ovation, or presenter tools.

00:13:34.164 --> 00:13:36.244
It lets you know
exactly where you're going,

00:13:36.268 --> 00:13:39.144
helps you pace yourself,
gives you a timer, the whole bit.

00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:41.034
Number four: always use remote control.

00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:43.357
Have you seen me touch
the computer? No. Why not?

00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:46.198
Because I'm using remote control.
Always use remote control.

00:13:46.222 --> 00:13:49.152
Number three: the handouts you give
are not your presentation.

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:50.564
If you follow my suggestions,

00:13:50.588 --> 00:13:52.839
you'll have a very spare,
Zen-like presentation,

00:13:52.863 --> 00:13:56.295
which is great to convey who you are
and get people emotionally involved,

00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:57.565
but not good as a handout.

00:13:57.589 --> 00:14:01.166
You want a handout that gives more
information; it has to stand without you.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.719
Number two: don't read your speech.
Can you imagine?

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:05.988
(Reading) "You should invest
in my company ... "

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.164
It doesn't work.

00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:10.789
And the number one presentation tip:
never, ever look at the screen.

00:14:10.813 --> 00:14:12.997
You're making a connection
with your audience,

00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.499
and you always want
a one-on-one connection.

00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:17.558
The screen should come up behind you

00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:20.253
and supplement what you're doing,
instead of replace you.

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.850
And that is how to pitch to a VC.
