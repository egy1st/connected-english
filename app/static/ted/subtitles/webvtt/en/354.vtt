00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that I was just in the process of completing,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about some of the controversies that that book inspired.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The book is called "The Blank Slate,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
based on the popular idea

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that the human mind is a blank slate,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that all of its structure comes from

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
socialization, culture, parenting, experience.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here are a few quotes indicating that:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"Man has no nature," from the historian

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Jose Ortega y Gasset;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"Man has no instincts," from the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
anthropologist Ashley Montagu;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is a blank slate,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and some of them just come from common sense.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As many people have told me over the years,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
anyone who's had more than one child

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
knows that kids come into the world

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
with certain temperaments and talents;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it doesn't all come from the outside.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Oh, and anyone who

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
has both a child and a house pet

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
will acquire a human language,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
whereas the house pet won't,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
presumably because of some innate different between them.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And anyone who's ever been

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in a heterosexual relationship knows that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There are also, I think,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
increasing results from

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the scientific study of humans

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that, indeed, we're not born blank slates.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One of them, from anthropology,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is the study of human universals.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
kind of an occupational

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
pleasure of anthropologists to show

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
how exotic other cultures can be,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and that there are places out there where, supposedly,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
everything is the opposite to the way it is here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But if you instead

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
look at what is common to the world's cultures,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you find that there is an enormously rich set

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of behaviors and emotions

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and ways of construing the world

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and they range from aesthetics,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
affection and age statuses

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
attempts to control, the color white

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and a worldview.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Also, genetics and neuroscience

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are increasingly showing that the brain

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
is intricately structured.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and his colleagues in which they --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
using MRI --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
measured the distribution of gray matter --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that is, the outer layer of the cortex --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in a large sample of pairs of people.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They coded correlations in the thickness

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of gray matter in different parts of the brain

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
using a false color scheme, in which

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
no difference is coded as purple,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and any color other than purple indicates

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a statistically significant correlation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
By definition, two people picked at random

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
can't have correlations in the distribution

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of gray matter in the cortex.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This is what happens in people who share

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
are not purple, showing that if one person

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
has a thicker bit of cortex

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in that region, so does his fraternal twin.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And here's what happens if you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
get a pair of people who share all their DNA --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
namely, clones or identical twins.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now, these aren't just

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
differences in anatomy,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
like the shape of your ear lobes,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but they have consequences in thought and behavior

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
As you can see, there are two inventors

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in the waiting room of a patent attorney.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
studies of identical twins who were separated at birth

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and then tested in adulthood

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
show that they have astonishing similarities.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And this happens in every pair of identical twins

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
separated at birth ever studied --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
My favorite example is a pair of twins,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
one of whom was brought up

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and both of them liked to surprise people

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the story might seem to good to be true,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but when you administer

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
batteries of psychological tests,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you get the same results -- namely,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
identical twins separated at birth show

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
quite astonishing similarities.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Now, given both the common sense

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and scientific data

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
why should it have been such an appealing notion?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The foremost is that if we're blank slates,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
then, by definition, we are equal,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
because zero equals zero equals zero.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But if something is written on the slate,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
then some people could have more of it than others,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and according to this line of thinking, that would justify

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
discrimination and inequality.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Another political fear of human nature

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is that if we are blank slates,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we can perfect mankind --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
through social engineering.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
then perhaps some of them might condemn us

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to selfishness, prejudice and violence.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And just to make a long story short:

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
first of all, the concept of fairness

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
is not the same as the concept of sameness.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in the Declaration of Independence,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that all men are created equal,"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that all men are clones."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and that every person ought to be treated

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
as an individual, and not prejudged

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
by the statistics of particular groups

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that they may belong to.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Also, even if we were born

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
with certain ignoble motives,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That is because the human mind

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is a complex system with many parts,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and some of them can inhibit others.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
For example, there's excellent reason to believe

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to profit from the lessons of history.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So even if people did have impulses

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
towards selfishness or greed,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that's not the only thing in the skull,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In the book, I

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
go over controversies such as this one,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and a number of other hot buttons,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
including the arts, cloning, crime,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
free will, education, evolution,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
gender differences, God, homosexuality,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Nazism, parenting, politics,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
race, rape, religion, resource depletion,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
social engineering, technological risk and war.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And needless to say, there were certain risks

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in taking on these subjects.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
When I wrote a first draft of the book,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and here are some of

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the reactions that I got:

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
"Better get a security camera for your house."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
or positions in scholarly societies."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in your author bio."

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
"Do you have tenure?"

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
(Laughter)

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Well, the book came out in October,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and nothing terrible has happened.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I -- I like --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
There was indeed reason to be nervous,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and there were moments in which I did feel nervous,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
knowing the history

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
of what has happened to people

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
who've taken controversial stands

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
or discovered disquieting findings

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in the behavioral sciences.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
of people who have been slandered, called Nazis,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
for stumbling across or arguing

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
about controversial findings.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And you never know when you're going to

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
come across one of these booby traps.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
My favorite example is a pair of psychologists

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
who did research on left-handers,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and have a shorter lifespan.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It's not clear, by the way, since then,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
whether that is an accurate generalization,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but the data at the time seemed to support that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Well, pretty soon they were barraged

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
with enraged letters,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
death threats,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
coming from irate left-handers

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and their advocates,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and they were literally afraid to open their mail

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
because of the venom and vituperation

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that they had inadvertently inspired.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Well,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the night is young, but the book has been out

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for half a year,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and nothing terrible has happened.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
None of the dire professional consequences

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
has taken place --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I haven't been

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
exiled from the city of Cambridge.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But what I wanted to talk about

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
are two of these hot buttons

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that have aroused the strongest response

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in the 80-odd reviews

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that The Blank Slate has received.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and see if you can guess which two

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
inspired probably 90 percent

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
of the reaction in the various reviews

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and radio interviews.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It's not violence and war,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it's not race, it's not gender,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They are: the arts and parenting.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Laughter)

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So let me tell you what

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
aroused such irate responses,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and I'll let you decide if whether they --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the claims are really that outrageous.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Let me start with the arts.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I note that among the long list of human universals

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that I presented a few slides ago

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
are art.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There is no society ever discovered

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that we would consider the arts.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
appears to be a human universal.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The telling of stories, music,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
dance, poetry -- found in all cultures,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and many of the motifs and themes

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
give us pleasure in the arts

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
can be found in all human societies:

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
a preference for symmetrical forms,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the use of repetition and variation,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
even things as specific as the fact

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
that in poetry all over the world,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
you have lines that are very close

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to three seconds long, separated by pauses.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Now, on the other hand,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in the second half of the 20th century,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the arts are frequently said to be in decline.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I have a collection,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
deploring the fact that

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the arts are in decline in our time.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I'll give you a couple of representative quotes:

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
are visible in every department of human activity."

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And a more recent one:

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is becoming increasing problematical.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Serious book stores are losing their franchise,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by commercializing their repertory,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
symphony orchestras are diluting their programs,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
public television is increasing its dependence

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
on reruns of British sitcoms,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
classical radio stations are dwindling,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
That's from Robert Brustein,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the famous drama critic and director,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
in The New Republic about five years ago.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
but by any standard

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
they have never been flourishing

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to a greater extent.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
There are, of course, entirely new art forms

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and new media, many of which you've heard

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
over these few days.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
By any economic standard,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the demand for art of all forms

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
is skyrocketing,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
as you can tell from the price of opera tickets,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
by the number of books sold,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
by the number of books published,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the number of musical titles released,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
the number of new albums and so on.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The only grain of truth to this

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
complaint that the arts are in decline

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
come from three spheres.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
One of them is in elite art since the 1930s --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
say, the kinds of works performed

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
by major symphony orchestras,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
where most of the repertory is before 1930,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
or the works shown in

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
major galleries and prestigious museums.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
In literary criticism and analysis,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
probably 40 or 50 years ago,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
literary critics were a kind of cultural hero;

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
now they're kind of a national joke.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And the humanities and arts programs

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
in the universities, which by many measures,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
indeed are in decline.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Students are staying away in droves,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
universities are disinvesting

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in the arts and humanities.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Well, here's a diagnosis.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
they need all the help that they can get.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that this supposed decline

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
in the elite arts and criticism

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
occurred in the same point in history in which

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
there was a widespread denial of human nature.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
A famous quotation can be found --

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if you look on the web, you can find it in

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
literally scores

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of English core syllabuses --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
"In or about December 1910,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
human nature changed."

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and there's some debate

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
as to what she actually meant by that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that -- it's used now

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
as a way of saying that all forms

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
of appreciation of art

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
that were in place for centuries, or millennia,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
in the 20th century were discarded.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
The beauty and pleasure in art --

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
probably a human universal --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
were -- began to be considered saccharine,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
or kitsch, or commercial.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
is the desire to destroy beauty" --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
which was considered bourgeois or tacky.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And here's just one example.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I mean, this is perhaps a representative example

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
of the visual depiction of the female form

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in the 15th century;

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
here is a representative example

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And, as you can see, there -- something has changed

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
in the way the elite arts

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
appeal to the senses.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Indeed, in movements of modernism

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and post-modernism,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
there was visual art without beauty,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
literature without narrative and plot,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
poetry without meter and rhyme,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
architecture and planning without ornament,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
human scale, green space and natural light,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
music without melody and rhythm,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and criticism without clarity,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Laughter)

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But here, there -- one of the most famous literary

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
English scholars of our time

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is the Berkeley professor,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Judith Butler.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And here is an example of

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
one of her analyses:

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
"The move from a structuralist account in which capital

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is understood to structure social relations

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
in relatively homologous ways

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
convergence and rearticulation

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Well, you get the idea.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
By the way, this is one sentence --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
you can actually parse it.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate"

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
was that elite art and criticism

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
in the 20th century,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
although not the arts in general,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
have disdained beauty, pleasure,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
clarity, insight and style.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
People are staying away from elite art and criticism.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
What a puzzle -- I wonder why.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Well, this turned out to be probably

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
the most controversial claim in the book.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
in order to deflect ire

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
from discussions of gender and Nazism

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and race and so on. I won't comment on that.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
But it certainly inspired

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
an energetic reaction

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
from many university professors.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Well, the other hot button is parenting.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And the starting point is the -- for that discussion

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
was the fact that we have all

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
been subject to the advice

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
of the parenting industrial complex.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Now, here is -- here is a

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
representative quote from a besieged mother:

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
so they'll grow up to be healthy adults.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
so they'll grow up smart.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
word games for reading success, large motor play,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
to figuring out what to play with my kids."

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
with this mother.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
are useless. They're useless because they don't control

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
for heritability. They measure some correlation

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
between what the parents do, how the children turn out

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and assume a causal relation:

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
that the parenting shaped the child.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Parents who talk a lot to their kids

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
have kids who grow up to be articulate,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
to be violent and so on.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And very few of them control for the possibility

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
that parents pass on genes for --

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
that increase the chances a child will be articulate

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
or violent and so on.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
who provide an environment

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
but not genes to their kids,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
The genetically controlled studies

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
have some sobering results.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Remember the Mallifert twins:

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
remarkably similar.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
because not only would they share their genes,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
but they would also share their environment.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
That would make them super-similar, right?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
who are separated at birth are no less similar

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
than if they had grown up together.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Everything that happens to you in a given home

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
over all of those years

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
appears to leave no permanent stamp

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
on your personality or intellect.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
is that adopted siblings reared together --

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the mirror image of identical twins reared apart,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
they share their parents, their home,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
their neighborhood,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
What it suggests is that children are shaped

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
not by their parents over the long run,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
but in part -- only in part -- by their genes,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in part by their culture --

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
the culture of the country at large

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
and the children's own culture, namely their peer group --

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
that's what kids care about --

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
chance events as you live your life.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So let me conclude

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
with just a remark

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
to bring it back to the theme of choices.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I think that the sciences of human nature --

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, 


00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
neuroscience, cognitive science --

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
are going to, increasingly in the years to come,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
upset various dogmas,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
careers and deeply-held political belief systems.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And that presents us with a choice.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
The choice is whether certain facts about humans,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
or topics, are to be considered taboos,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
because no good can come from it,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
or whether we should explore them honestly.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I have my own

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
answer to that question,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
which comes from a great artist of the 19th century,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Anton Chekhov, who said,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
"Man will become better when you show him

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
what he is like."

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And I think that the argument

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
can't be put any more eloquently than that.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
(Applause)
