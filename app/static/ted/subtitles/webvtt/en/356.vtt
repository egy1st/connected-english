00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was here about four years ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
talking about the relationship of design and happiness.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I learned very few things in addition since

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter) --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but made a whole number of them into projects since.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"Everybody always thinks they are right."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They were combined in the media.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We're doing changing media.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is a projection that can see the viewer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
as the viewer walks by.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We do them for our clients.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They are commissioned.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or pay for all the billboards or the production of these,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so there's always a client attached to them.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that's lined with fashion stores.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
"Worrying solves nothing."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"Money does not make me happy"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
it was 12 following pages.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It said, "Money does does make me happy."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
into letting us wrap his building.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it says, "does not make me happy."

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We had a show that just came down last week in New York.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We steamed up the windows permanently,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and every hour we had a different designer come in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Massimo Vignelli.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Singapore was quite in discussion.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is a little spot that we filmed there

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
because all of these sentiments --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
some banal, some a bit more profound --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
all originally had come out of my diary.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I do go often into the diary

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If it's -- see it for a long enough time,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I actually do something about it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And the very last one is a billboard.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We let that lie around in the sun.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
so on day one the billboard said,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Three days later it faded, and a week later,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
no more complaining anywhere.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Thank you so much.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Applause)
