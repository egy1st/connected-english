00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which are the two primary factors --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
bordering on the inevitable at this point,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
whether one is in favor of that or not --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
better conceptualized as kinds of technology,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the space of conceptual design.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here's what I mean. Politics and --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
let's focus on the political system in particular question here,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is the system of democracy.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for the control and deployment of power.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to do it in a radically diffused fashion;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and democracy is a set of technologies,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which have the effect of, in principle,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
diffusing the power source to a large number of people

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
by virtue of what the broader public has done.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, consider religion -- in this case Islam,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which is the religion that, in some direct sense,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
At the beginning of the Bush administration,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
After 9/11, the tables were turned.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And the president decided, with his advisors,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That began with Afghanistan,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a decision was made through the technology of democracy --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
again, notice, not a perfect technology --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but through the technology of democracy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
this time, a war in Iraq.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war"

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
is that we have to acknowledge that Islam,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and as a consequence, at one degree of remove,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And I would add that bin Laden and his followers

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and the world of Islam as they see and define it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but it's also meant by the Islamists --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Within the sphere of people who have that view,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
who disagree with bin Laden in his application,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but agree that Islam is the answer.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Islam represents a way of engaging the world

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
peace, justice and equality,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
by identifying either of these propositions --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And I think a good way to prove this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
you can't show a picture of democracy.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You can show the Capitol --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I had the same problem when I was designing the cover

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of my forthcoming book, in fact --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
what do you put on the cover to show democracy?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And the same problem with respect to Islam.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
That's because these are the kinds of concepts

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that are not susceptible to easy representation.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It follows from that that all of the people in the world

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
who say that they are Muslims can, in principle,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In other words, unlike the word hope,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
these are essentially contested concepts.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And as a consequence of this disagreement,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
"I have the right version of Islam."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, so says George W. Bush.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Other people would say it means something else.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Some people would say that Islam means submission.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Other people would say it means an acknowledgement

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or recognition of God's sovereignty.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Other people say no, that's not enough,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean."

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Now, if Islam and democracy are at present

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
in a moment of great confrontation,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
what does that mean?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which was fear.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
as a consequence of this confrontation --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
a confrontation which many, many people

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in the Muslim world do not want,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
many, many people in the American democracy do not want,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
many people elsewhere in the world do not want,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is that there's also a hopeful response to this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that Islam and democracy are technologies.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And they're manipulable in ways

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What do I have in mind?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
or just a source of powerful personal identity,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and one can find this by reading any of the sources

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to have choice in the spheres of personal life,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and, yes, in the sphere of religion,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And many of these Muslims further say

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that their disagreement with the United States

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
is that it, in the past and still in the present,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in order to promote America's short-term interests.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now, during the Cold War, that may have been

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a defensible position for the United States to take.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
That's an academic question.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But now that the Cold War is over,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and pretty close to the same here in the United States,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
if you talk to people and ask them --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And we see this among activist, practical Muslims,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
like the Muslims who are presently the elected,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
who are promoting their own religious values,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
who are elected by their own people

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
because they were perceived as honest and sincere

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
because of their religious values,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
are fundamentally incompatible.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
with what we consider the core of democracy --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But I'm here to tell you that technologies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
are more malleable than that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and basic human equality before God,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
try to form a party known as the Center Party,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They weren't even allowed to form a party.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They were actually blocked from even forming a party

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
under the political system there. Why?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Because they would have done extraordinarily well.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
In the most recent elections in the Muslim world --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and those in Turkey -- in each case,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
were far and away the most successful vote-getters

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
every place they were allowed to run freely.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So had they contested a larger number of the seats,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
they would have done even better.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
who care very, very deeply about their traditions,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
who do not want to compromise those values --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that these two ideas can work together.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now what would that look like?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to democracy as we know it in the United States.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
or Muslims out in the rest of the world --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
conceptualize Islam.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It will be transformative of Islam as well.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And as a result of this convergence,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
we'll in fact have close compatibility.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
if you're talking about these issues.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
many Muslims will conclude that the United States

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
is not the kind of place that they want to emulate

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
with respect to its forms of political government.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that Islam is the enemy somehow --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And even though, for political tactical reasons,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to think of the other side as an enemy.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
in defining who that enemy is.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So the risks are very great.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
are also not to be underestimated,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
even by, and I would say especially by, people

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it cannot be the right strategy,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
because we opposed the war in the first place."

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
That's not the way human circumstances operate.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You face the circumstances you have in front of you

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and you go forward.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Well, what I'm here to say then is,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
for people who are skeptical about the war,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
there is a possibility for the government of the United States

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to create real forms of government that are truly democratic

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and also truly Islamic.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
for people who care about these issues to make sure

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
that within the technology of democracy, in this system,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to encourage that outcome.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That's a hopeful message,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
as incurring serious obligation for all of us.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but only if we put what we can into it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Thanks.
