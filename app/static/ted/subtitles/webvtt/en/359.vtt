WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that delights and disturbs the senses.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
From urban planning and master planning

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to theater and all sorts of stuff.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The thing that all the work has in common

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And these are everyday conventions,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I've assembled a sampling of work

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that all share a kind of productive nihilism

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is an image that won us a competition

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but as a primary building material.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and rethinks our dependence on vision?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So this is how we sought to do it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
wind direction, wind speed, dew point,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and it processes this data in a central computer

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that calibrates the degree of water pressure

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and distribution of water throughout.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it sits on just four very delicate columns.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
These are the fog nozzles, the interface,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now, here we go, one side, the outside

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and then from the inside of the space

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you can see what the quality of the space was.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Unlike entering any normal space,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
purposeless and dimensionless.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
All references are erased,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So, this is an exhibition pavilion

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So, the audience is dispersed,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So here the world is put out of focus,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
while our visual dependence is put into focus.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The public, you know, once disoriented

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
can actually ascend to the angel deck above

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So, all the waters of the world are served there,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so we thought that, you know, after being at the water

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and moving through the water and breathing the water,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you could also drink this building.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And so it is sort of a theme,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We really wanted to bring out

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
our absolute dependence on this master sense,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
10 million dollars producing an effect

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
it was kind of a meaning machine

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
but it continues to live in edible form.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And this is the highest honor

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Anyway, moving along.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
such as installation artist, architect,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And we did a lot of media work,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
also a lot of experimental theater projects.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the problem of the retrospective

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
was something we were very uncomfortable with.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's a kind of invention of the museum

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
to the public of a body of work.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So, what you see here

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And we actually had to install white walls

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And what you see is -- actually,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and it was really very much fun to work with them.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
while they were helping us with this.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In any case, the way it works is that

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Initially these holes were lone blemishes,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and as the exhibition continued

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the walls became increasingly perforated.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
opening views from gallery to gallery.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And so this was a three-month performance piece

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Also the visual separation.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And this is one of the blackout spaces

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the wall now actively competed for attention.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
basically exposed the discomfort of the work

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which is on the waterfront.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
but I'll simply say that the building negotiates

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I mean that's its primary objective,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
both its program and its architectural conceit.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
The building incorporates the site,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but it dispenses it in very small doses

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
in the way that the museum is choreographed.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
where the view is turned off.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And then, this is a view going up,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and then you could come into the theater,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The view is denied in the galleries

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
where we receive just natural light,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
The original intention of this space,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which was unfortunately never realized,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
was to use lenticular glass

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the intention was really to not get a climax,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but to have the view stalk you,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
This was eliminated because the view was too good,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The architect lost here.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
is this Mediatheque,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So, it's already sticking out into space enough,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
where the public can get onto the server

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and here is a point where architecture --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or a lava lamp or something like that.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of the technological and the natural in the project.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Moving along to Lincoln Center.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And for the purposes of this talk,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and it happens to be our current obsession,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and descends several levels under the street.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
before the renovation, which we just started.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And one of the things that we were asked to do

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
where we're framing with this kind of canopy --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Before and after shot. (Applause)

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to just talk about the hall itself,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The walls are made of absorptive surface,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
half absorptive, half reflective,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
which is not very good for concert sound.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Because we can't eliminate a single seat,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So it's a very, very thin architecture.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to take away the distraction of the subway noise.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
with a material, with a wood material

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that basically covers all the surfaces:

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Just everything is lined, it incorporates --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
every single thing that you could possibly imagine

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
is tucked into this high-performance skin.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
But one more added feature.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
everything that prevents this intimacy

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
with the performers, we add one little detail,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
as it is when the concert starts.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
this lighting effect,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
in a kind of seamless continuity

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
it connects audience with players.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
this is what they look like out there.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
(Laughter)

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And this is Tully in construction now.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
(Applause)
