00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Let me show you some images

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this is Sultanbelyi,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the new urban world.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, why do I say that?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
his name is Julius.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So, I had been there almost three months,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and at certain points we were walking around,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
he grabbed my hand for support,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and he's one of many.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, close to 200,000 people a day

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
migrate from the rural to the urban areas.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
close to 70 million people a year.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And here are the statistics.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Today -- a billion squatters,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
one in six people on the planet.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
2030 -- two billion squatters,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one in four people on the planet.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
better than one in three people on earth.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I was thinking this morning of the good life,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and before I show you the rest of my presentation,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm going to violate TED rules here,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
of what we think the good life is.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It was a 10 by 10 cell.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Armstrong and his friends had no water --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
they bought it from a nearby tap owner --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and no sewers or sanitation.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They did have electricity,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and could only power one feeble bulb.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
This was Southland, a small shanty community

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But it could've been anywhere in the city,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
with no services, no toilets, no rights.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and they could not afford to be late with the money.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and we perspired as we ate.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And it was set in a wider watery ooze.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
squatted, and defecated.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But it stood in jarring contrast

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to something Armstrong had said as we were eating --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Instead, the human spirit radiated out

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
no legal neighborhood could: freedom.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
'This place is very addictive,' he had said.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Nobody is controlling what you do.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He meant back beyond that mountain of trash,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
back in the legal city, of legal buildings,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
with legal leases and legal rights.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
'Once you have stayed here,' he said,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This is home improvement:

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
putting plastic tarps on your roof.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and plaster over the brick, some color,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
he's got new tile on the roof.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then you get Rocinha

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and you can see that it's getting even better.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
The buildings here are multi-story.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They develop -- you can see on the far right

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
one where it seems to just stack on top of each other,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
room, after room, after room.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and they sell their loggia or roof rights,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and someone else builds on top of their building,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and then that person sells the roof rights,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and someone else builds on top of their building.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to a higher level of design.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The crud in the front is mattress stuffing,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and you see that all over Turkey.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But the green building, on behind,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
you can see that the top floor is not occupied,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
so people are building with the possibility of expansion.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And then you finally get squatter homes like this,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
which is built on the suburban model.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
They're quite vital places, these communities.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and there's a bus route that runs through it,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
lots of people out on the street.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
These communities in these cities are actually more vital

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
than the illegal communities.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
They have more things going on in them.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
these are how you get around the community.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It's on very steep ground.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So, that's just a rock in the hillside.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And these becos are normally very crowded,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
all sorts of things.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
so close to the train tracks that the merchants

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
This is a shopping street in Kibera,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This here, on the right-hand side,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
it's a hotel.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So, that's a restaurant.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
People tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and they steal the electrical power

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and wire the neighborhood.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
People burn trash to get rid of the garbage,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and they dig their own sewer channels.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And when they have more money they cement their streets,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
they steal electricity; they install a pump

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I say there are two things.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That does not necessarily mean property rights,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
because property rights create a lot of complications.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and have to pay back the debt,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and sometimes have to sell their property

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in order to pay back the debt.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
sometimes don't work in these cases,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but they do need security of tenure.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
That can mean community organizing from below,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
but it can also mean possibilities from above.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
One is that -- it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
which means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
if they don't catch you during the night.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in the community, you can petition the government

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So, these are the civic leaders of the future.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
on the tent along the same highway median.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
They're very outspoken. They're very active.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
They can be community leaders.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
This woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And there were three old ladies who lived in --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and they are the backbone of the community there.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
This is Richard Muthama Peter,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and the people in the neighborhood,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and is a great resource in the community.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the fruit merchant with his two kids here,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The future of these communities is in the people

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and in our ability to work with those people.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
from what Armstrong said, and from all these people,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is that these are neighborhoods.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The issue is not urban poverty.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
this is a legitimate form of urban development --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and that cities have to engage these residents,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because they are building the cities of the future.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Thank you very much.
