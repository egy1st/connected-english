00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.306
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:09.932
and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.137
The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:17.283
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.906
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.619
and photographers were telling us another.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.163
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:32.324
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.968
They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:40.586
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.479
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.767
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.518
It puts a human face on issues which, from afar,

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.925
can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.570
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.992
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.315
And I understood that documentary photography

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:11.805
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.853
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:21.338
My TED wish. Thereâ€™s a vital story that needs to be told

00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:24.945
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:28.529
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:31.778
to use news photography in the digital era.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.671
