00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
very, very north end of it there,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
where it's absolutely freezing cold.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
(Laughter)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I couldn't pick a career.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
My mother wanted me to be a dentist.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So I actually went to school in Belfast,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which was where all the action happened.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this was a pretty common sight.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The school I went to was pretty boring.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They forced us to learn things like Latin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The school teachers weren't having much fun,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the sports were very dirty or very painful.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I was actually rowing for my school here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of the entire school.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And that was the finishing post right there.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So this was extremely embarrassing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But our school at that time got a grant from the government,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and they left the programming manuals lying around.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so students like myself with nothing to do,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we would learn how to program it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Also around this time, at home,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this was the computer that people were buying.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I brought a picture with big hair.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Laughter).

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I just want to get that out of the way.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Sinclair ZX81.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And -- you see the picture at the bottom?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's what they thought they had built it for.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The reality is we got the programming manual

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we started making games for it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We were programming in BASIC,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which is a pretty awful language for games,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so we ended up learning Assembly language

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so we could really take control of the hardware.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and he's showing his machine.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You had this same thing in America,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The graphics were just horrible.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
"Death Rider."

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They started making their own video games.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so males choose the lucky rabbit.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
which was quite the leap.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And if you're wondering how much 16K is,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
this eBay logo here is 16K.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And in that amount of memory someone programmed

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
a full flight simulation program.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And that's what it looked like.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I spent ages flying this flight simulator,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
smiling in this photograph.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I went on for the next 20 years or so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
making a lot of different games.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Because I was from the United Kingdom,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so they decided to call it hero instead.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I personally preferred the Spanish version,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
which was "Tortugas Ninja."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
That was much better.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and Hollywood to actually work together on something --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I've done that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It grows every year.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Last year was the biggest year.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
43 percent of gamers are female.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The average age of gamers?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Well, obviously it's for children, right?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So 37 is our target audience.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All video games are violent.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so it's just not true.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Online gaming statistics.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
making the publisher about another 275 million.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
so basically it pays for itself in about a month.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
A player in a game called "Project Entropia"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You have to remember that this is not a real island.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But he got great terms on it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This purchase included mining and hunting rights,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
ownership of all land on the island, and a castle

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
with no furniture included.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Laughter)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
by the gamers themselves.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
They found clever ways to trade items

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and to sell their accounts to each other

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
so that they could make money while they were playing their games.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I liked this one the best:

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So as far as popularity of games,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
what do you think these people are doing here?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's what the show looks like.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the people that went there absolutely loved it.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What do you think these people are doing?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
against each other.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And this is happening in every city around the world.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This is happening in your local cities too,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you're probably just not aware of it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
so ridiculously better.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
10 years from now.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So we're going to start that video.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Video: Throughout human history people have played games.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
As man's intellect and technology have evolved

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
so too have the games he plays.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Music)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Applause)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Think about that's where we are right now,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to get better.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You need to be really an incredible artist.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
more fantasy artists that can create places

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
we've never been to before, or characters that

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
we've just never seen before.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But if you were to go to a game developers conference,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
meaning, understanding and feeling.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I came across a student who's absolutely excellent

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
at expressing himself, and this student agreed

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that he would not show his video to anybody until

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
you here at TED had seen it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So I'd like to play this video.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
reality and video games.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
has become programmed, electronic and virtual.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
has finally begun to crumble.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I'm a video game addict and this is my story.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:24.000
(Music)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
In the year of my birth

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I played in the backyard, learned to read,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and even ate some of my vegetables.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
But as was the case for most of my generation,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
left their mark on me.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
At some point something clicked.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
(Music)

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
With the combination of simple, interactive stories

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
became more than just an escape.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:53.000
(Music)

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
a certain number of hours I have spent playing,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and video games had begun to erode my own understanding

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
of what is real and what is not.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I still crave more.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Music)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
in what unfolded before me on screen.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
A generation who may experience much more meaning

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
through video games than they will through the real world.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Play enough video games and eventually you will

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I know I can.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
downloaded, streaming, HD reality.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We are interacting with our entertainment.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I have come to expect this level of interaction.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Without it, the problems faced in the real world --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
of prime time TV.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
more real than any textbook or any news story.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
The people who create these games are smart.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
A well-designed video game will seamlessly

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
As one becomes more experienced

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the awareness of physical control melts away.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I know what I want and I do it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I know violent video games make my mother worry.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
What troubles me is not that video game violence

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is becoming more and more like real life violence,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
but that real life violence is starting to look more and more

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
like a video game.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
(Music)

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
These are all troubles outside of myself.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I, however, have a problem very close to home.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Something has happened to my brain.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Music)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
before we even think.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and all of them are hardwired into our brains.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
in the same cities and doing many of the same things

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
we once did in real life, only virtually.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Consider this --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
The sensory cues are very similar.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
doing something on the TV than you have in real life.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
this is almost as beautiful as my games are.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
For my virtual worlds are perfect.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
brainwashing the masses with video games

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
rather than just simply TVs.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
completely vulnerable to re-programming.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
in the real world.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
There is a potential to do good as well.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
the real world we live in, that game developers realize

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that they have tremendous responsibilities before them.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I'm not sure what the future of video games holds

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
for our civilization.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
there is a greater and greater potential for other people

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
to feel the same way I do.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
What I have only recently come to realize

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and addictive to me.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I know that I am losing my grip.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Part of me is just waiting to let go.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
or how flat the real world may seem to us,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
(Applause)

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
DP: Wow.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000
(Applause)

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I found that video very, very thought provoking,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
for me to talk about was graphics and audio.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Video games give an awful lot of other things too,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and that's why people get so addicted.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
The most important one being fun.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
The name of this track is "The Magic To Come."

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Who is that going to come from?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Is it going to come from the best directors in the world

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
as we thought it probably would?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I don't think so.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
The same with students or highly creative people,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
writers and people like that.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
teaching video game courses.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
(Laughter)

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
He's out of time.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
(Laughter)

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
because they want to pitch their video game ideas.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I'm sitting at the front of the class,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
and they're actually pitching their ideas.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So it's hard to get students to come back to class,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
but it is possible.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
in the video game world?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And as I've shown here, we have the audience.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
and have millions of people ready to play.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You know, we have the technology.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
stunning and really immersive.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
She's never going to know a world where video games

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I just hope she likes video games.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
(Laughter)

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So, my closing thought.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
but for those that like to look a little deeper,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
to creative minds that like to think big.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Thank you.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.
