00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to take you back basically to my hometown,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and to a picture of my hometown of the week

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that "Emergence" came out.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it's a picture we've seen several times.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Basically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I live right there in the West Village,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we hadn't taken it from somebody else.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and creative potential of density, of largely urban density,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of connecting people and putting them together in one place,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and share physical space together.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
those towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
here was that density kills.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And that of all the technologies that were exploited

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to make that carnage come into being,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
110 stories above the ground.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If they hadn't been crowded --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and you can see that very powerfully.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and you could sense that the air was not healthy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which was located about 20 blocks away, north.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And so I went out.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
as I was walking north to buy this air filter,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
which was that the streets were completely alive with people.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
as it was for about a week after,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and the West Village had never seemed more lively.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I walked up along Hudson Street --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
past the White Horse Tavern,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
were all out there -- had them all open.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
People were out.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And it was a beautiful urban day,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The city was there.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
All the things that make a great city successful

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and all the things that make a great city stimulating --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they were all on display there on those streets.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And I thought, well, this is the power of a city.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I mean, the power of the city --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we talked about cities as being centralized in space,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but what makes them so strong most of the time

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is they're decentralized in function.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and cause the whole thing to fail.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
was destroyed by the attacks,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
the city had never looked more alive.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If you'd gone into the minds of the people,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
well, you would have seen a lot of trauma,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and you would have seen a lot of heartache,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But the system itself of this city was thriving.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I took heart in seeing that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and how some of those reasons kind of map

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
on to where the Web is going right now.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The question that I found myself asking to people

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
when I was talking about the book afterwards is --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
when you've talked about emergent behavior,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
when you've talked about collective intelligence,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is to ask, who builds a neighborhood?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Who decides that Soho should have this personality

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Well, there are some kind of executive decisions,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Everybody contributes a little bit.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
No single person is really the ultimate actor

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
behind the personality of a neighborhood.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
post-9/11 in my neighborhood?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Well, it was the whole city.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The whole system kind of working on it,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and everybody contributing a small little part.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in a bunch of interesting ways --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
most of which weren't around, actually,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
except in very experimental things,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
when I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So it's been a very optimistic time, I think,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and I want to just talk about a few of those things.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that's starting to emerge online right now.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And the old one looked like this.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" -- those are his links.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But nothing really says

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
"Click here for a picture of my dog."

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That is -- you know, there's no sentence

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and link to it, and somebody reading the page

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There's one person putting up the link, and there's another person

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The new model is much more like this,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and we've already seen a couple of references to this.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
one of my great, kind of shining achievements --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
which is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
who has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Because effectively, what's happening here,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
but it's worth just thinking about it --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but rather somehow the entire web of people

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and Google just sitting there and running the numbers.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So there's this collective decision-making that's going on.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and Google is just helping us

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but there are some new twists on this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and so you have kind of an authority --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a weblog that has a lot of links to it

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And you can get a list.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You can also rank it by the latest posts.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So when I was talking in "Emergence,"

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that, basically, you could link to somebody else

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And that was one of the reasons why the web

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
wasn't quite as emergent as it could be

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to be able to really do interesting things.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
there's nothing artificial.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus."

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
on the right-hand side of my page,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
That little list there would change.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And there are all these interesting tools.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Google does the Google Zeitgeist,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and they publish it with lots of fun graphs.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Well, you know, we should expect to see that.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So the key thing in terms of these new tools

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the question is, are you finding out something new?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
which is basically, you take an abstract term,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and you search Google for that term,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So basically, the number of pages that mention this term,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is that person's Google Share of that term.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So you can do kind of interesting contests.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So Richard Saul Wurman

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Laughter)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I had no idea.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
No, that's not true.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
(Laughter)

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of the Mola mola fish.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
(Laughter)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Laughter)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I think, right there.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
(Laughter)

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I think it would be good next year.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but this analysis some of you may have seen.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It just came out. This is bursty words,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They're talking about slavery in 1860.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
1985, right at the center of the Reagan years --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
(Laughter)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
"emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But seriously, actually, what you can see there,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
contracting all those verbs.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do,"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And so something we kind of knew,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I'll go very quickly.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The question now -- and this is the really interesting question --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that got a lot of attention about a month ago,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and this is basically the distribution of links

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
on the web to all these various different blogs.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and a long tail of blogs with very few links.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Now this is a very interesting thing.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It's caused a lot of controversy

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And so the question is, "Why is this happening?"

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
It's not being imposed by fiat from above.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Now, what's great about it is that people are working on --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And basically, the shape appears

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
if you're the first site there, everybody links to you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
If you're the second site there, most people link to you.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and then you get this kind of shape.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And it creates a kind of planned emergence.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
You're not totally in control,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
because you have an end result which is

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
maybe a more democratic spread of voices.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
about power laws and software that could change it

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
is the fact that we're having the conversation.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I hope it continues here.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Thanks a lot.
