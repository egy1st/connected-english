00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, indeed, I have spent my life

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But when I try and think about what I've learned

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
work, love and play.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but with serenity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So since I tell stories, let me look back

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As for that first sphere of work,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that fierce ambition is a good thing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
He had a huge ambition.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
from which he was born.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
No schooling was possible for him,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He couldn't eat.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
How true for Lincoln.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Though he never would travel to Europe,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But there were so many losses in his early life

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that he was haunted by death.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
His mother died when he was only nine years old;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Moreover, when his mother lay dying,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
she did not hold out for him the hope

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that they would meet in an afterworld.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
She simply said to him,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
As a result he became obsessed with the thought

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But only as he grew older did he develop

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but followed by other cultures as well --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
you could live on in the memory of others.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
when he was in his early 30s.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Three things had combined to lay him low.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
not certain he was ready to marry her,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And his political career in the state legislature

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was on a downward slide.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but I've not yet done anything to make any human being

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
remember that I have lived."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
He eventually won a seat in Congress.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
"but some people are stronger in the broken places."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
for the presidency over three far more experienced,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And then when he won the general election,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
he stunned the nation even more

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He said, "Look, these are the strongest

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and most able men in the country.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
might have put it in less noble fashion:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
than outside the tent pissing in."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
(Laughter)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
For each of them soon came to understand

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that he possessed an unparalleled array of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
emotional strengths and political skills

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
into permanent hostility.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
He shared credit with ease,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Applause)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
had worked their way into his very soul.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
his own hand was numb and shaking

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So he put the pen down.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But if I sign with a shaking hand,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So he waited until he could take up the pen

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and sign with a bold and clear hand.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But even in his wildest dreams,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Lincoln could never have imagined

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
how far his reputation would reach.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
to a very remote area of the Caucasus,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
where there were only wild barbarians,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
who had never left this part of Russia.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who laughed like the sunrise,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that if a young man should travel there,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
he would be an old man when he arrived.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
He was stunned.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Not as great a general as Napoleon,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
in the integrity of his character

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and the moral fiber of his being.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So in the end that powerful ambition

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to go through that string of political failures

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and the darkest days of the war.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
His story would be told.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
encompassing family, friends and colleagues --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it, too, takes work and commitment.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
when I helped him on his memoirs,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
work, power and individual success,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to get him through the days

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
once the presidency was gone.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We had a big dance at the White House.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
President Johnson did dance with me that night.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Not that peculiar --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to work directly for him in the White House.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But it was not to be that simple.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
For in the months leading up to my selection,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
like many young people, I'd been active

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
in the anti-Vietnam War movement,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
which unfortunately came out in The New Republic

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
two days after the dance in the White House.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
(Laugher)

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
(Laughter)

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But instead, surprisingly, he said,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
"Oh, bring her down here for a year,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and if I can't win her over, no one can."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So I did end up working for him in the White House.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
He was a great storyteller.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
There was a problem with these stories, however,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But they were great, nonetheless.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
even when I didn't have any at all.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Everything was working perfectly,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
all the romantic trappings.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And he started out,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And my heart sank.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then he said,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
"You remind me of my mother."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But I must say, the older I've gotten,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
A victor in a thousand contests,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
he opened up to me in ways he never would have

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
had I known him at the height of his power --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
But it also brought home to me the lessons

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
about the importance of finding balance in life.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
everything in the world to feel good about in those last years,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
he had all the money he needed to pursue

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
any leisure activity he wanted;

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
sailboats, speedboats.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
He had servants to answer any whim,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and he had a family who loved him deeply.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
meant that in his retirement he could find no solace

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
In those last years, he said he was so sad

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and their children in turn.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
But it was too late.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Despite all that power, all that wealth,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
he was alone when he finally died --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
his ultimate terror realized.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So as for that third sphere of play,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
which he never had learned to enjoy,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I've learned over the years

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
even during those dark days of the war.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
for a few precious hours he could imagine himself

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
back in Prince Hal's time.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But an even more important form of relaxation for him,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
was a love of -- somehow -- humor,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
as a sidelight to the sadness.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
His storytelling powers had first been recognized

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
when he was on the circuit in Illinois.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The lawyers and the judges would travel

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
from one county courthouse to the other,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
He would stand with his back against a fire

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And all these stories became part of his memory bank,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
so he could call on them whenever he needed to.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
One of his favorite stories, for example,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And as Lincoln told the story,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And the British people were still upset

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
about losing the Revolution,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
so they decided to embarrass him a little bit

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
by putting a huge picture of General Washington

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
of George Washington being in an outhouse.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
"What do you mean?" they said.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
faster than the sight of General George Washington."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
(Laughter)

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
(Applause)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and he had hundreds of these stories --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you would have to relax.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So between his nightly treks to the theater,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
he found that form of play which carried him through his days.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
In my own life, I shall always be grateful

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to the end of the fall,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to have something to occupy my mind and heart

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
other than my work.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It all began when I was only six years old,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
while listening to baseball games --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
so that when he went to work in New York during the day,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I could record for him the history of that afternoon's

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Brooklyn Dodgers game.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Now, when you're only six years old,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and your father comes home every single night

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
recounted every single play of every inning

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It makes you think there's something magic about history

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to keep your father's attention.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
from those nightly sessions with my father.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
(Laughter)

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So I finally learned you had to tell a story

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
from beginning to middle to end.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I must say, so fervent was my love

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that I had to confess in my first confession

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
two sins that related to baseball.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And I was so excited --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
you'll be struck dead at the threshold.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It's not a sin."

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
for this one night with Roy Campanella.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Laughter)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I told the priest right away.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And then came my second sin.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
would break arms, legs and ankles --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
(Laughter)

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
(Laughter)

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
"Oh yes," I said.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
(Laughter)

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
when I was still in my 20s,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
before I had gotten married and had my three sons,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and became an irrational Red Sox fan.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
with our season tickets,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I must say there is magic in these moments.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
When I open my eyes and I see my sons

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
in the place where my father once sat,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I feel an invisible loyalty and love

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
but whose heart and soul they have come to know

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
through all the stories I have told.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Allowing me to learn from these large figures

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
about the struggle for meaning for life.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Allowing me to believe that the private people

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
we have loved and lost in our families,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and the public figures we have respected in our history,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
really can live on, so long as we pledge

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
(Applause)

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Thank you.
