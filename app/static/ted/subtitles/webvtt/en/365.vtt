00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and so on. And within the last decade or two,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
underlying many of these past collapses.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But there were also plenty of places in the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where societies have been developing for thousands of years

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
without any sign of a major collapse,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to our situation today, because today as well, there are

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What about ourselves?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Obviously the answer to this question is not going

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a European society with literate records,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and every one of them ended up dead.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
which was a particular problem for them because

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
cultural factors that made it difficult for them

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to solve their problems were: their commitments to a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What about a society today?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
like the most pristine environment in the United States.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
have caused damage of billions of dollars.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
from salinization, problems of forest management,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
social security, investments and so on --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and to no government regulation; values that worked well

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Are there any general conclusions that arise?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
common threads that emerge from these comparisons

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of past societies that did or did not collapse

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
after their peak, they collapse. For example,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, this is a frequent theme:

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
about a society today, you should be looking not at the value

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the most devastating case of complete deforestation?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are more fragile than others. And then finally,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
another generalization. I'm now teaching a course

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
then maybe in the next century people will be asking,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
about why societies fail to solve their problems --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
why do they fail to succeed in solving them?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are able to insulate themselves from the consequences

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
For example, among the Greenland Norse --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is more followers and more sheep and more resources

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
the chiefs powerful in the short run,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
but led to the society's collapse in the long run.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in the United States today. Especially because

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the decision makers in the United States are frequently

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
able to insulate themselves from consequences

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and so on. And within the last couple of years,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
it's been obvious that the elite in the business world

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
correctly perceive that they can advance

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
their short-term interest by doing things that are

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
good for them but bad for society as a whole,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and other businesses. They are quite correct

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that these things are good for them in the short term,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
although bad for society in the long term.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So, that's one general conclusion about why societies

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And the other generalization that I want to mention

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is that it's particularly hard for a society to make

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
strongly held values that are good in many circumstances

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
but are poor in other circumstances. For example,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
were held together for four-and-a-half centuries

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
by their shared commitment to religion,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
also made it difficult for them to change at the end

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in this remote outpost of European civilization

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
for 250 years has been their British identity.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
But today, their commitment to a British identity

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to change course when the things that get you in trouble

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
are the things that are also the source of your strength.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What's going to be the outcome today?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
of soil, of climate change, invasive species,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
one year away from losing their loggable forest,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about the world's environmental problems?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is to forget about there being any single thing that is

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
the most important thing we need to do.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
That means that those of us in this room who are less than

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
or else these conflicts are going to get settled

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The big problems facing the world today are not at all

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
entirely in our power to deal with these problems.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
we need to be doing. Thank you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
(Applause)
