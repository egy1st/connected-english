00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
when I was between seven and 10 years old.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
was destroyed by the war.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So I became interested in understanding

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
what contributed to a life that was worth living.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that I could see as a possible answer to that question.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Instead of talking about little green men,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
flying saucers into the sky.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
some sense of order after the chaos of war.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And this seemed very interesting to me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And I started reading his books after that lecture.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Then I came to this country to study psychology

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is a typical result that many people have presented,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and there are many variations on it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
surveyed in the United States since 1956

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
say that their life is very happy.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And that hasn't changed at all.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Whereas the personal income,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But you find essentially the same results,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
material resources, contributes to unhappiness,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So my research has been focused more on --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
after finding out these things that actually corresponded

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to my own experience, I tried to understand:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
do we feel really happy?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And to start

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000
what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And the interview was 40 pages long.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But this little excerpt is a very good summary

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of what he was saying during the interview.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Now, "ecstasy" in Greek meant

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
simply to stand to the side of something.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We know the temples they built, where people could come

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to experience a different reality.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We know about the circuses,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the arenas, the theaters.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We are participating in a reality that is different

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
from that of the everyday life that we're used to.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But this man doesn't need to go there.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and as he does that, he can imagine sounds

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that had not existed before in that particular combination.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
like Jennifer did in her improvisation,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
he enters that different reality.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
more than about 110 bits of information per second.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
you need to process about 60 bits per second.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's why you can't hear more than two people.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
of creating something new, as this man is,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
how his body feels, or his problems at home.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
His body disappears,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
his identity disappears from his consciousness,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and at the same time to feel that he exists.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So existence is temporarily suspended.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So what it's telling you here

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
is that obviously this automatic,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
who is very well trained and who has developed technique.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
than what was there before.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Now, when that happens,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
he says the music just flows out.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And because all of these people I started interviewing --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
this was an interview which is over 30 years old --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And it happens in different realms.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is by a student of mine who interviewed

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
But it happens in other activities.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
For instance, this is another student of mine,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
with some of the leading athletes in the world.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the same essential description of the phenomenology

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of the inner state of the person.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You don't think; it goes automatically,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and very ethical, very socially responsible.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You see that these people define success

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
as something that helps others and at the same time

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
makes you feel happy as you are working at it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
you can't have just one of these things be successful

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
if you want a meaningful and successful job.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She is the founder of Body Shop,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the natural cosmetics king.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It's kind of a passion that comes

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
from doing the best and having flow while you're working.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
without a product -- they didn't have a product,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
can feel the joy of technological innovation,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I couldn't improve on this as a good example

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
of how flow enters the workplace.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Now, when we do studies --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
we have, with other colleagues around the world,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
who enjoy their work.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And regardless of the culture,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
you get immediate feedback.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You know that what you need to do

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is possible to do, even though difficult,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
you feel part of something larger.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And once the conditions are present,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And we can measure this very precisely, actually,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
where you are, what you're thinking about.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
people experience at that moment and the amount of skill

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that they feel they have at that moment.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So for each person we can establish an average,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
which is the center of the diagram.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
which will be different from that of anybody else.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
If we know what that set point is,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and it will be when your challenges are higher than average

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and skills are higher than average.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And you may be doing things very differently from other people,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
will be when you are doing what you really like to do --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
if work is what provides flow for you.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And then the other areas become less and less positive.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
but you can move into flow fairly easily

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
by just developing a little more skill.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and to enter that -- going back to flow --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
then they develop higher skills.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Control is also a good place to be,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It's not very challenging any more.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And if you want to enter flow from control,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you have to increase the challenges.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So those two are ideal and complementary areas

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
from which flow is easy to go into.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The other combinations of challenge and skill

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
become progressively less optimal.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Boredom begins to be very aversive

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and apathy becomes very negative:

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
you don't feel that you're doing anything,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
The largest single contributor to that experience

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Even though sometimes watching television

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and you get feedback from it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Thank you.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
