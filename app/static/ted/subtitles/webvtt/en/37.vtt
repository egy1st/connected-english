00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.695
Charles Van Doren, who was later
a senior editor of Britannica,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.896
said the ideal encyclopedia
should be radical --

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.456
it should stop being safe.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.696
But if you know anything about the history
of Britannica since 1962,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.056
it was anything but radical:

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.976
still a very completely safe,
stodgy type of encyclopedia.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.176
Wikipedia, on the other hand,
begins with a very radical idea,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.216
and that's for all of us
to imagine a world

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.256
in which every single person on the planet

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.856
is given free access
to the sum of all human knowledge.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.214
And that's what we're doing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.159
So Wikipedia --

00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:34.616
you just saw the little
demonstration of it --

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.736
it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.618
It's written by thousands of volunteers

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.642
all over the world
in many, many languages.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.056
It's written using wiki software --

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.636
which is the type of software
he just demonstrated --

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.375
so anyone can quickly edit and save,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.495
and it goes live
on the Internet immediately.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.256
And everything about Wikipedia is managed
by virtually an all-volunteer staff.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.696
So when Yochai is talking
about new methods of organization,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.216
he's exactly describing Wikipedia.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.669
And what I'm going to do today

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:07.093
is tell you a little bit more
about how it really works on the inside.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.096
So Wikipedia's owned
by the Wikimedia Foundation,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.336
which I founded,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.776
a nonprofit organization.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.816
And our goal, the core aim
of the Wikimedia Foundation,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.016
is to get a free encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.056
And so, if you think
about what that means,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.616
it means a lot more
than just building a cool website.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.656
We're really interested
in all the issues of the digital divide,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.256
poverty worldwide,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.656
empowering people everywhere
to have the information that they need

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.896
to make good decisions.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.496
And so we're going
to have to do a lot of work

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.216
that goes beyond just the Internet.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.536
And so that's a big part of why
we've chosen the free licensing model,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.799
because that empowers local
entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:48.735
they can take our content
and do anything they like with it --

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.441
you can copy it, redistribute it --

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.877
and you can do it
commercially or non-commercially.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.401
So there's a lot of opportunities
that are going to arise around Wikipedia

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:57.620
all over the world.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.496
We're funded by donations from the public,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.976
and one of the more
interesting things about that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.816
is how little money
it actually takes to run Wikipedia.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.376
So Yochai showed you the graph
of what the cost of a printing press was.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.736
And I'm going to tell you
what the cost of Wikipedia is.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.618
But first, I'll show you how big it is.

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:20.602
So we've got over 600,000
articles in English.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.496
We've got two million total articles
across many, many different languages.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.776
The biggest languages
are German, Japanese, French --

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.496
all the Western-European
languages are quite big.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.896
But only around one-third
of all of our traffic to our web

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.556
clusters to the English Wikipedia,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.438
which is surprising to a lot of people.

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:42.816
A lot of people think in a very
English-centric way on the Internet,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.736
but for us, we're truly global.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.333
We're in many, many languages.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.016
How popular we've gotten to be --
we're a top-50 website

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.231
and we're more popular
than the New York Times.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.495
So this is where we get
to Yochai's discussion.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.296
This shows the growth of Wikipedia --
we're the blue line there --

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.016
and this is the New York Times over there.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.616
And what's interesting about this

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.976
is the New York Times website is a huge,
enormous corporate operation

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.496
with I have no idea
how many hundreds of employees.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.536
We have exactly one employee,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.176
and that employee
is our lead software developer.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.376
And he's only been our employee
since January 2005,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.216
all the other growth before that ...

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.856
So the servers are managed
by a ragtag band of volunteers.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.856
All the editing is done by volunteers.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.416
And the way that we're organized

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.123
is not like any traditional
organization you can imagine.

00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:33.862
People are always asking,
"Well, who's in charge of this?"

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:35.056
or "Who does that?"

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.376
And the answer is:
anybody who wants to pitch in.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.880
It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.776
We've got over 90 servers now
in three locations.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.056
These are managed by volunteer
system administrators who are online.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.136
I can go online
any time of the day or night

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.456
and see eight to 10 people waiting for me

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.016
to ask a question or something,
anything about the servers.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.376
You could never afford
to do this in a company.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.616
You could never afford

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.376
to have a standby crew of people
24 hours a day

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.720
and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.696
So we're doing around
1.4 billion page views monthly,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.760
so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.736
And everything is managed
by the volunteers.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.976
And the total monthly cost
for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.936
And that's essentially our main cost.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.216
We could actually do without the employee.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.656
We hired Brian because he was
working part-time for two years

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.976
and full-time at Wikipedia,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.216
so we actually hired him,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.880
so he could get a life
and go to the movies sometimes.

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:40.336
So the big question when you've got
this really chaotic organization is,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.576
why isn't it all rubbish?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.520
Why is the website as good as it is?

00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:45.376
First of all, how good is it?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.936
Well, it's pretty good.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.176
It isn't perfect,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.216
but it's much better
than you would expect,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.923
given our completely chaotic model.

00:04:51.947 --> 00:04:54.963
So when you saw him make
a ridiculous edit to the page about me,

00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:58.736
you think, "Oh, this is obviously
just going to degenerate into rubbish."

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.491
But when we've seen quality tests --

00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:02.531
and there haven't been enough of these yet

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:05.136
and I'm really encouraging
people to do more,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.296
comparing Wikipedia
to traditional things --

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.096
we win hands down.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.856
So a German magazine
compared German Wikipedia,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.216
which is much, much smaller than English,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.336
to Microsoft Encarta
and to Brockhaus multimedial,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.816
and we won across the board.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.221
They hired experts to come and look
at articles and compare the quality,

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:26.565
and we were very pleased with that result.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.856
So a lot of people have heard about
the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.536
The media has covered this
somewhat extensively.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.376
It started out
with an article in Red Herring.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.216
The reporters called me up and they --

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.216
I mean, I have to say
they spelled my name right,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.176
but they really wanted to say
the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.576
it's tearing apart
the Wikipedia community.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.096
And so they quote me as saying,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.016
"They're the most contentious
in the history of Wikipedia."

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.616
What I actually said
is they're not contentious at all.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.736
So it's a slight misquote.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.536
(Laughter)

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.576
The articles were edited quite heavily.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.056
And it is true that we did
have to lock the articles

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.416
on a couple of occasions.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.816
Time magazine recently reported that

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.856
"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.736
and Wales locked the entries
on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.016
This came after I told the reporter
that we had to lock it for --

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.176
occasionally a little bit here and there.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.576
So the truth in general
is that the kinds of controversies

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.791
that you would probably think
we have within the Wikipedia community

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:32.536
are not really controversies at all.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.056
Articles on controversial topics
are edited a lot,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.056
but they don't cause much controversy
within the community.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.800
And the reason for this is that most
people understand the need for neutrality.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.296
The real struggle is not
between the right and the left --

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.940
that's where most people assume --

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:53.016
but it's between
the party of the thoughtful

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.336
and the party of the jerks.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.176
And no side of the political spectrum

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.656
has a monopoly
on either of those qualities.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.256
The actual truth
about the specific Bush-Kerry incident

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.256
is that the Bush-Kerry articles

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.256
were locked less than one percent
of the time in 2004,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.336
and it wasn't because
they were contentious;

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.696
it was just because
there was routine vandalism --

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.416
which happens sometimes even on stage ...

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.576
(Laughter)

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.136
Sometimes even reporters have reported
to me that they vandalized Wikipedia

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.496
and were amazed
that it was fixed so quickly.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.296
And I said -- you know, I always say,
please don't do that.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.896
That's not a good thing.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.416
So how do we do this?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.296
How do we manage the quality control?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.520
How does it work?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.816
So there's a few elements,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.096
mostly social policies
and some elements of the software.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.856
So the biggest
and the most important thing

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.611
is our neutral point of view policy.

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:46.397
This is something
that I set down, from the very beginning,

00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:50.456
as a core principle of the community
that's completely not debatable.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.376
It's a social concept of cooperation,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.896
so we don't talk a lot
about truth and objectivity.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.976
The reason for this is if we say

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.576
we're only going to write
the "truth" about some topic,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.807
that doesn't do us a damn bit of good
of figuring out what to write,

00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:07.367
because I don't agree with you
about what's the truth.

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:09.736
But we have this
jargon term of neutrality,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.216
which has its own long history
within the community,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.656
which basically says,
any time there's a controversial issue,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.256
Wikipedia itself should not
take a stand on the issue.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.519
We should merely report on what
reputable parties have said about it.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.616
So this neutrality policy
is really important for us

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.896
because it empowers a community
that is very diverse

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.216
to come together
and actually get some work done.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.376
So we have very diverse contributors

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.616
in terms of political,
religious, cultural backgrounds.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.456
By having this firm neutrality policy,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.496
which is non-negotiable
from the beginning,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.378
we ensure that people can work together

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:43.616
and that the entries
don't become simply a war

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.783
back and forth
between the left and the right.

00:08:45.807 --> 00:08:49.522
If you engage in that type of behavior,
you'll be asked to leave the community.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.696
So, real-time peer review.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.856
Every single change on the site
goes to the "Recent changes" page.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.376
So as soon as he made his change,
it went to the "Recent changes" page.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.376
That recent changes page
was also fed into an IRC channel,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.976
which is an Internet chat channel

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.200
that people are monitoring
with various software tools.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.376
And people can get RSS feeds --

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.496
they can get email
notifications of changes.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.176
And then users can set up
their own personal watch list.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.693
So my page is on quite a few
volunteers' watch lists,

00:09:19.717 --> 00:09:21.413
because it is sometimes vandalized.

00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:27.416
And therefore, what happens is someone
will notice the change very quickly,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.816
and then they'll just
simply revert the change.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.756
There's a "new pages feed," for example,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.836
so you can go
to a certain page of Wikipedia

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.788
and see every new page as it's created.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.970
This is really important

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.196
because a lot of new pages
are just garbage that has to be deleted,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.456
you know, "ASDFASDF."

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.396
But also, that's some
of the most interesting and fun things,

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.636
some of the new articles.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.236
People will start an article
on some interesting topic,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.076
other people will find that intriguing

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.496
and jump in and help
and make it much better.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.416
So we do have edits by anonymous users,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.296
which is one of the most controversial
and intriguing things about Wikipedia.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.936
So, Chris was able to do his change --
he didn't have to log in or anything;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.776
he just went on the website
and made a change.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.856
But it turns out
that only about 18 percent

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.376
of all the edits to the website

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.736
are done by anonymous users.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.096
And that's a really important
thing to understand:

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.376
the vast majority of the edits
that go on on the website

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.096
are from a very close-knit community
of maybe 600 to 1,000 people

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.740
who are in constant communication.

00:10:21.764 --> 00:10:24.336
And we have over 40 IRC channels,
40 mailing lists.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.936
All these people know each other.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.008
They communicate.
We have off-line meetings.

00:10:28.032 --> 00:10:30.652
These are the people
who are doing the bulk of the site,

00:10:30.676 --> 00:10:35.324
and they are, in a sense,
semi-professionals at what they're doing.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.296
The standards we set for ourselves

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.376
are equal to or higher
than professional standards of quality.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.916
We don't always meet those standards,
but that's what we're striving for.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.798
And so that tight community
is who really cares for the site,

00:10:47.822 --> 00:10:50.456
and these are some
of the smartest people I've ever met.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.736
It's my job to say that,
but it's actually true.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.496
The type of people who were drawn
to writing an encyclopedia for fun

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.856
tend to be pretty smart people.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.976
The tools and the software:
there's lots of tools that allow us --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.620
allow us, meaning the community --

00:11:03.644 --> 00:11:05.696
to self-monitor
and to monitor all the work.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.216
This is an example
of a page history on "flat Earth,"

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.296
and you can see some changes
that were made.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.616
What's nice about this page
is you can immediately take a look at this

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.216
and see, "OK, I understand now."

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.016
When somebody goes and looks at --

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.183
they see that someone,
an anonymous IP number,

00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:20.696
made an edit to my page.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.776
That sounds suspicious.
Who is this person?

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.016
Somebody looks at it --

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.056
they can immediately see
highlighted in red

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.976
all of the changes that took place --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.616
to see, OK, well, these words
have changed, things like this.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.260
So that's one tool that we can use

00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:35.804
to very quickly monitor
the history of a page.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.816
Another thing that we do
within the community

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.216
is we leave everything very open-ended.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.616
Most of the social rules
and the methods of work

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.056
are left completely open-ended
in the software.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.096
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.216
And so there's nothing
in the software that enforces the rules.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.256
The example I've got up here
is the Votes for Deletion page.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.856
So, I mentioned earlier,
people type "ASDFASDF" --

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.096
it needs to be deleted.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.596
Cases like that,
the administrators just delete it.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.956
There's no reason
to have a big argument about it.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.315
But you can imagine there's a lot
of other areas where the question is,

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:11.579
is this notable enough
to go in an encyclopedia?

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:15.176
Is the information verifiable?
Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.256
So we needed a social method
for figuring out the answer to this.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.138
And so the method that arose
organically within the community

00:12:21.162 --> 00:12:22.736
is the Votes For Deletion page.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.776
And in the particular
example we have here,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.296
it's a film, "Twisted Issues,"

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.776
and the first person says,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.496
"Now this is supposedly a film.
It fails the Google test miserably."

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.336
The Google test is you look in Google
and see if it's there,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.256
because if something's not even in Google,
it probably doesn't exist at all.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.856
It's not a perfect rule,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.216
but it's a nice starting point
for quick research.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.495
So somebody says, "Delete it, please.
Delete it -- it's not notable."

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:49.535
And then somebody says,
"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.816
'Film Threat Video Guide:
the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.745
So the next persons says, "Clean it up."

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:58.176
Somebody says, "I've found it on IMDB.
Keep, keep, keep."

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.016
And what's interesting about this
is that the software is --

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.576
these votes are just text
typed into a page.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.656
This is not really a vote
so much as it is a dialogue.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.416
Now it is true that at the end of the day,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.679
an administrator can go through here
and take a look at this and say,

00:13:14.703 --> 00:13:17.176
"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:
we'll delete it."

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.976
But in other cases,
this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.796
and we would keep it,
because if those last two keeps say,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.725
"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this
but I found it in a book,

00:13:26.749 --> 00:13:28.947
and I found a link
to a page that describes it,

00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:32.067
and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,
so please don't delete it,"

00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:33.276
then it would survive.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.896
And it also matters
who the people are who are voting.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.825
Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.

00:13:37.849 --> 00:13:40.376
Down here at the bottom,
"Keep, real movie," RickK.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.781
RickK is a very famous Wikipedian
who does an enormous amount of work

00:13:43.805 --> 00:13:46.536
with vandalism, hoaxes
and votes for deletion.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.376
His voice carries a lot of weight
within the community

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.972
because he knows what he's doing.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.336
So how is all this governed?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.496
People really want to know
about administrators, things like that.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.376
So the Wikipedia governance model,
the governance of the community,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.816
is a very confusing,
but workable mix of consensus --

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.376
meaning we try not to vote
on the content of articles,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.296
because the majority view
is not necessarily neutral --

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.616
some amount of democracy --

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.976
all of the administrators --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.796
these are the people
who have the ability to delete pages.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.656
That doesn't mean that they have
the right to delete pages.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.516
They still have to follow all the rules --
but they're elected by the community.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.970
Sometimes people --
random trolls on the Internet --

00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:29.377
like to accuse me
of handpicking the administrators

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.306
to bias the content of the encyclopedia.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.096
I always laugh at this, because I have
no idea how they're elected, actually.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.096
There's a certain amount of aristocracy.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.263
You got a hint of that
when I mentioned, like,

00:14:39.287 --> 00:14:41.439
RickK's voice would carry
a lot more weight

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:42.759
than someone we don't know.

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:45.496
I give this talk sometimes with Angela,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.251
who was just re-elected to the board
from the community --

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:49.771
to the Board of the Foundation,

00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:52.936
with more than twice the votes
of the person who didn't make it.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.896
And I always embarrass her because I say,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.216
"Well, Angela, for example,

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.656
could get away with doing
absolutely anything within Wikipedia,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.696
because she's so admired and so powerful."

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.536
But the irony is, of course, that Angela
can do this because she's the one person

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.536
who you know would never, ever
break any rules of Wikipedia.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.616
And I also like to say
she's the only person

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.856
who actually knows
all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.119
And then there's monarchy,

00:15:16.143 --> 00:15:18.159
and that's my role
on the community, so ...

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:20.576
(Laughter)

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.216
I was describing this in Berlin once,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.016
and the next day
in the newspaper the headline said,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.608
"I am the Queen of England."

00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:28.783
(Laughter)

00:15:28.807 --> 00:15:31.176
And that's not exactly what I said, but --

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.696
(Laughter)

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.296
the point is my role in the community --

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.016
Within the free software world,
there's been a long-standing tradition

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.256
of the "benevolent dictator" model.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.136
So if you look at most
of the major free software projects,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.936
they have one single person in charge

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.296
who everyone agrees
is the benevolent dictator.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.816
Well, I don't like the term
"benevolent dictator,"

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.816
and I don't think that it's my job
or my role in the world of ideas

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.176
to be the dictator of the future
of all human knowledge

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.416
compiled by the world.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.136
It just isn't appropriate.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.936
But there is a need still
for a certain amount of monarchy,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.536
a certain amount of --

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.336
sometimes we have to make a decision

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.599
and we don't want
to get bogged down too heavily

00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:15.336
in formal decision-making processes.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.256
So as an example
of how this can be important:

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.256
we recently had a situation where
a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.136
and they said,
"Oh, well, this is horrible,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.056
this Jewish conspiracy of a website,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.239
and we're going to get certain articles
deleted that we don't like.

00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:35.263
And we see they have a voting process,
so we're going to send --

00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:38.096
we have 40,000 members
and we're going to send them over

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.898
and they're all going to vote
and get these pages deleted."

00:16:40.922 --> 00:16:43.113
Well, they managed
to get 18 people to show up.

00:16:43.137 --> 00:16:45.896
That's neo-Nazi math for you.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.376
They always think they've got
40,000 members when they've got 18.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.896
But they managed to get 18 people
to come and vote in a fairly absurd way

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.936
to delete a perfectly valid article.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.696
Of course, the vote ended up
being about 85 to 18,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.976
so there was no real danger
to our democratic processes.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.295
On the other hand, people said,
"But what are we going to do?

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.575
I mean, this could happen.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.936
What if some group
gets really seriously organized

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.536
and comes in and wants to vote?"

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.335
Then I said, "Well, fuck it,
we'll just change the rules."

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.055
That's my job in the community:

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.656
to say we won't allow
our openness and freedom

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.256
to undermine the quality of the content.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.575
And so, as long as people
trust me in my role,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.456
then that's a valid place for me.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.516
Of course, because of the free licensing,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.017
if I do a bad job, the volunteers
are more than happy to take and leave --

00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:33.521
I can't tell anyone what to do.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.696
So the final point here
is that to understand how Wikipedia works,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.911
it's important to understand
that our wiki model is the way we work,

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:45.536
but we are not fanatical web anarchists.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.936
In fact, we're very flexible
about the social methodology,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.376
because ultimately,
the passion of the community

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.416
is for the quality of the work,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.416
not necessarily for the process
that we use to generate it.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.656
Thank you.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.936
(Applause)

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.736
Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.896
Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality
being a key to Wikipedia's success.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.256
It strikes me that much of the textbooks
that are used to educate our children

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.056
are inherently biased.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.696
Have you found Wikipedia
being used by teachers

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.176
and how do you see Wikipedia
changing education?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.416
Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers
are beginning to use Wikipedia.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.016
There's a media storyline about Wikipedia,
which I think is false.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.616
It builds on the storyline
of bloggers versus newspapers.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.776
And the storyline is,
there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.256
but academics hate it
and teachers hate it.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.856
And that turns out to not be true.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.416
The last time I got an email
from a journalist saying,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.156
"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.038
I sent it from my Harvard email address

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:51.315
because I was recently
appointed a fellow there.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.355
And I said, "Well,
they don't all hate it."

00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:54.456
(Laughter)

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.336
But I think there's going
to be huge impacts.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.776
And we actually have a project
that I'm personally really excited about,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.296
which is the Wikibooks project,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.416
which is an effort to create
textbooks in all the languages.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.016
And that's a much bigger project.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.656
It's going to take 20 years or so
to come to fruition.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.696
But part of that is to fulfill our mission

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.696
of giving an encyclopedia
to every single person on the planet.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.576
We don't mean we're going
to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.396
We mean we're going to give them
a tool that they can use.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.196
And for a lot of people in the world,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.396
if I give you an encyclopedia
that's written at a university level,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.976
it doesn't do you any good
without a whole host of literacy materials

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.776
to build you up to the point
where you can actually use it.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.943
The Wikibooks project
is an effort to do that.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:39.176
And I think that we're going to see --
it may not even come from us;

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.176
there's all kinds of innovation going on.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.360
But freely licensed textbooks
are the next big thing in education.
