WEBVTT

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.256
Whoa, dude.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.496
(Laughter)

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.360
Check out those killer equations. Sweet.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.656
Actually, for the next 18 minutes
I'm going to do the best I can

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.680
to describe the beauty
of particle physics without equations.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.320
It turns out there's a lot
we can learn from coral.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.816
A coral is a very beautiful
and unusual animal.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.376
Each coral head consists
of thousands of individual polyps.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.936
These polyps are continually
budding and branching

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.840
into genetically identical neighbors.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.856
If we imagine this
to be a hyperintelligent coral,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.056
we can single out an individual
and ask him a reasonable question.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.456
We can ask how exactly
he got to be in this particular location

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.176
compared to his neighbors --

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.760
if it was just chance,
or destiny, or what?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.160
Now, after admonishing us
for turning the temperature up too high,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.816
he would tell us that our question
was completely stupid.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840
These corals can be kind of mean, you see,

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.722
and I have surfing scars to prove that.

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.456
But this polyp would continue and tell us

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.536
that his neighbors were
quite clearly identical copies of him.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.896
That he was in all
these other locations as well,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.080
but experiencing them
as separate individuals.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.616
For a coral, branching
into different copies

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.498
is the most natural thing in the world.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.696
Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.520
would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.576
The mathematics of quantum mechanics

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.136
very accurately describes
how our universe works.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.018
And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.242
just like a coral.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.216
It's a weird thing for us humans
to wrap our minds around,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.096
since we only ever get
to experience one possibility.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
This quantum weirdness was first described

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.896
by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.616
The cat likes this version better.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.096
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box
with a radioactive sample

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.016
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,
branches into a state

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880
in which it is radiated
and a state in which it is not.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.616
(Laughter)

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.656
In the branch in which
the sample radiates,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.056
it sets off a trigger that releases poison
and Schrödinger is dead.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.976
But in the other branch of reality,
he remains alive.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.905
These realities are experienced
separately by each individual.

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.856
As far as either can tell,
the other one doesn't exist.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.096
This seems weird to us,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.976
because each of us
only experiences an individual existence,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.096
and we don't get to see other branches.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.416
It's as if each of us,
like Schrödinger here,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.600
are a kind of coral
branching into different possibilities.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.016
The mathematics
of quantum mechanics tells us

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.336
this is how the world
works at tiny scales.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.320
It can be summed up in a single sentence:

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.336
Everything that can happen, does.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.816
That's quantum mechanics.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.576
But this does not mean everything happens.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000
The rest of physics is about describing
what can happen and what can't.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.096
What physics tells us
is that everything comes down to geometry

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240
and the interactions
of elementary particles.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.320
And things can happen only if
these interactions are perfectly balanced.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.656
Now I'll go ahead and describe
how we know about these particles,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.720
what they are and how this balance works.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.056
In this machine,
a beam of protons and antiprotons

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.096
are accelerated to near the speed of light

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.776
and brought together in a collision,
producing a burst of pure energy.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.696
This energy is immediately converted
into a spray of subatomic particles,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.016
with detectors and computers
used to figure out their properties.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.296
This enormous machine --

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.496
the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Geneva --

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.216
has a circumference of 17 miles
and, when it's operating,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.840
draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.696
We can't predict specifically

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.656
what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.400
Quantum mechanics tells us
all possibilities are realized.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.720
But physics does tell us
what particles can be produced.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.056
These particles must have
just as much mass and energy

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.440
as is carried in
by the proton and antiproton.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.816
Any particles more massive
than this energy limit aren't produced,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.240
and remain invisible to us.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.896
This is why this new
particle accelerator is so exciting.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.176
It's going to push
this energy limit seven times

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.936
beyond what's ever been done before,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.680
so we're going to get to see
some new particles very soon.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.496
But before talking
about what we might see,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.840
let me describe the particles
we already know of.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.560
There's a whole zoo
of subatomic particles.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
Most of us are familiar with electrons.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.336
A lot of people in this room
make a good living pushing them around.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.536
(Laughter)

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.576
But the electron also has
a neutral partner called the neutrino,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.720
with no electric charge
and a very tiny mass.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.856
In contrast, the up and down quarks
have very large masses,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.080
and combine in threes to make
the protons and neutrons inside atoms.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.096
All of these matter particles
come in left- and right-handed varieties,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.882
and have antiparticle partners
that carry opposite charges.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.616
These familiar particles

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.656
also have less familiar
second and third generations,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.200
which have the same charges as the first
but have much higher masses.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.216
These matter particles all interact
with the various force particles.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.456
The electromagnetic force
interacts with electrically charged matter

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.296
via particles called photons.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.856
There is also a very weak force

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.613
called, rather unimaginatively,
the weak force ...

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.776
(Laughter)

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.208
that interacts
only with left-handed matter.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.456
The strong force acts between quarks

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.616
which carry a different kind of charge,
called color charge,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.416
and come in three different varieties:
red, green and blue.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.640
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann
for these names -- they're his fault.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.256
Finally, there's the force of gravity,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.376
which interacts with matter
via its mass and spin.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.616
The most important thing
to understand here

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.440
is that there's a different kind of charge
associated with each of these forces.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.256
These four different forces
interact with matter

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.185
according to the corresponding charges
that each particle has.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.816
A particle that hasn't been seen yet,
but we're pretty sure exists,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.536
is the Higgs particle, which gives masses
to all these other particles.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.696
The main purpose
of the Large Hadron Collider

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.760
is to see this Higgs particle,
and we're almost certain it will.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.000
But the greatest mystery
is what else we might see.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.576
And I'm going to show you
one beautiful possibility

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.981
towards the end of this talk.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.536
Now, if we count up
all these different particles

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.416
using their various spins and charges,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.760
there are 226.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.440
That's a lot of particles
to keep track of.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.096
And it seems strange

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.680
that nature would have
so many elementary particles.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.336
But if we plot them out
according to their charges,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.000
some beautiful patterns emerge.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.400
The most familiar charge
is electric charge.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.496
Electrons have an electric charge,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.736
a negative one,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.776
and quarks have
electric charges in thirds.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.056
So when two up quarks and a down quark
are combined to make a proton,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.096
it has a total
electric charge of plus one.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.376
These particles also have antiparticles,
which have opposite charges.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.216
Now, it turns out the electric charge

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.736
is actually a combination
of two other charges:

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.360
hypercharge and weak charge.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.760
If we spread out
the hypercharge and weak charge

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:50.096
and plot the charges of particles
in this two-dimensional charge space,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.376
the electric charge
is where these particles sit

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.800
along the vertical direction.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.096
The electromagnetic
and weak forces interact with matter

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.336
according to their hypercharge
and weak charge,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.616
which make this pattern.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.776
This is called
the unified electroweak model,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.000
and it was put together back in 1967.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.576
The reason most of us
are only familiar with electric charge

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.200
and not both of these
is because of the Higgs particle.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.136
The Higgs, over here on the left,
has a large mass

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.616
and breaks the symmetry
of this electroweak pattern.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.216
It makes the weak force very weak
by giving the weak particles a large mass.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.336
Since this massive Higgs sits along
the horizontal direction in this diagram,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.656
the photons of electromagnetism
remain massless

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.616
and interact with electric charge
along the vertical direction

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.880
in this charge space.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.816
So the electromagnetic and weak forces

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.176
are described by this pattern
of particle charges

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.576
in two-dimensional space.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.120
We can include the strong force
by spreading out its two charge directions

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.296
and plotting the charges
of the force particles in quarks

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.560
along these directions.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.896
The charges of all known particles

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.296
can be plotted in
a four-dimensional charge space,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.496
and projected down to two dimensions
like this so we can see them.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.296
Whenever particles interact,
nature keeps things in a perfect balance

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.480
along all four of these charge directions.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.176
If a particle and an antiparticle collide,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.856
it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.320
in all four charge directions.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.936
At this point, anything can be created

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.320
as long as it has the same energy
and maintains a total charge of zero.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.376
For example, this weak force particle
and its antiparticle

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.176
can be created in a collision.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.096
In further interactions,
the charges must always balance.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.440
One of the weak particles could decay
into an electron and an antineutrino,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.816
and these three
still add to zero total charge.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.919
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.736
So these patterns of charges
are not just pretty.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.256
They tell us what interactions
are allowed to happen.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.895
And we can rotate this charge space
in four dimensions

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.696
to get a better look
at the strong interaction,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.976
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.336
In a strong interaction,
a strong force particle,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.576
such as this one,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.360
interacts with a colored quark,
such as this green one,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.065
to give a quark with a different
color charge -- this red one.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.776
And strong interactions
are happening millions of times

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.936
each second in every atom of our bodies,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.640
holding the atomic nuclei together.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.856
But these four charges
corresponding to three forces

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.280
are not the end of the story.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.856
We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.176
When we include these,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.856
each matter particle
has two different spin charges,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.856
spin-up and spin-down.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.936
So they all split and give a nice pattern
in six-dimensional charge space.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.936
We can rotate this pattern
in six dimensions

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.480
and see that it's quite pretty.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.736
Right now, this pattern
matches our best current knowledge

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.160
of how nature is built at the tiny scales
of these elementary particles.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.656
This is what we know for certain.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.816
Some of these particles
are at the very limit

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.216
of what we've been able to reach
with experiments.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.456
From this pattern

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.816
we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales --

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.720
the way the universe works
at these tiny scales is very beautiful.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.536
But now I'm going to discuss
some new and old ideas

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.080
about things we don't know yet.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.816
We want to expand this pattern
using mathematics alone,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.456
and see if we can get our hands
on the whole enchilada.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.576
We want to find
all the particles and forces

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.736
that make a complete picture
of our universe.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.416
And we want to use this picture
to predict new particles

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.964
that we'll see when experiments
reach higher energies.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.176
So there's an old idea in particle physics

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.936
that this known pattern of charges,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.536
which is not very symmetric,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.416
could emerge from a more perfect pattern
that gets broken --

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.456
similar to how the Higgs particle
breaks the electroweak pattern

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.136
to give electromagnetism.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.216
In order to do this,
we need to introduce new forces

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.560
with new charge directions.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.176
When we introduce a new direction,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.616
we get to guess what charges
the particles have along this direction,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.760
and then we can rotate it
in with the others.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.216
If we guess wisely,
we can construct the standard charges

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.936
in six charge dimensions
as a broken symmetry

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.360
of this more perfect pattern
in seven charge dimensions.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.016
This particular choice
corresponds to a grand unified theory

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.720
introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.176
When we look at this new unified pattern,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.160
we can see a couple of gaps
where particles seem to be missing.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.200
This is the way
theories of unification work.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.496
A physicist looks for larger,
more symmetric patterns

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.840
that include the established
pattern as a subset.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.816
The larger pattern allows us
to predict the existence of particles

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.080
that have never been seen.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.496
This unification model
predicts the existence

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.016
of these two new force particles,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.680
which should act a lot
like the weak force, only weaker.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.896
Now, we can rotate this set
of charges in seven dimensions

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.480
and consider an odd fact
about the matter particles:

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.656
the second and third generations of matter

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.576
have exactly the same charges
in six-dimensional charge space

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.840
as the first generation.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.560
These particles are not
uniquely identified by their six charges.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.160
They sit on top of one another
in the standard charge space.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.016
However, if we work
in eight-dimensional charge space,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.640
then we can assign
unique new charges to each particle.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.760
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440
and see what the whole pattern looks like.

00:12:11.983 --> 00:12:14.936
Here we can see the second
and third generations of matter now,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.080
related to the first generation
by a symmetry called "triality."

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.016
This particular pattern
of charges in eight dimensions

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.560
is actually part of the most beautiful
geometric structure in mathematics.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.840
It's a pattern of the largest
exceptional Lie group, E8.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.736
This Lie group is a smooth,
curved shape with 248 dimensions.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.736
Each point in this pattern
corresponds to a symmetry

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.800
of this very complex and beautiful shape.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.536
One small part of this E8 shape
can be used to describe

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.176
the curved space-time
of Einstein's general relativity,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.440
explaining gravity.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.896
Together with quantum mechanics,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.376
the geometry of this shape
could describe everything

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.016
about how the universe works
at the tiniest scales.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.336
The pattern of this shape living
in eight-dimensional charge space

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.640
is exquisitely beautiful,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.496
and it summarizes thousands
of possible interactions

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.216
between these elementary particles,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.880
each of which is just a facet
of this complicated shape.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.416
As we spin it, we can see
many of the other intricate patterns

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.680
contained in this one.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.256
And with a particular rotation,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.456
we can look down through this pattern
in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.296
and see all the particles at once.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.896
It's a very beautiful object,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.296
and as with any unification,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.680
we can see some holes where new particles
are required by this pattern.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.576
There are 20 gaps
where new particles should be,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.336
two of which have been filled
by the Pati-Salam particles.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.616
From their location in this pattern,
we know that these new particles

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.976
should be scalar fields
like the Higgs particle,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.680
but have color charge
and interact with the strong force.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.776
Filling in these new particles
completes this pattern,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.136
giving us the full E8.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.176
This E8 pattern has
very deep mathematical roots.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.680
It's considered by many to be the most
beautiful structure in mathematics.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.416
It's a fantastic prospect that this object
of great mathematical beauty

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.776
could describe the truth
of particle interactions

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.440
at the smallest scales imaginable.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.656
And this idea that nature is described
by mathematics is not at all new.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.400
In 1623, Galileo wrote this:

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.056
"Nature's grand book,
which stands continually open to our gaze,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.576
is written in the language of mathematics.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.216
Its characters are triangles,
circles and other geometrical figures,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.096
without which it is humanly impossible
to understand a single word of it;

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.400
without these, one is wandering around
in a dark labyrinth."

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.800
I believe this to be true,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.456
and I've tried
to follow Galileo's guidance

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.816
in describing the mathematics
of particle physics

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.216
using only triangles, circles
and other geometrical figures.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.976
Of course, when other physicists
and I actually work on this stuff,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.200
the mathematics
can resemble a dark labyrinth.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.776
But it's reassuring that at the heart
of this mathematics

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.720
is pure, beautiful geometry.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.896
Joined with quantum mechanics,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.856
this mathematics describes our universe
as a growing E8 coral,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.496
with particles interacting
at every location in all possible ways

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.120
according to a beautiful pattern.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.456
And as more of the pattern
comes into view using new machines

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.296
like the Large Hadron Collider,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.160
we may be able to see whether nature
uses this E8 pattern or a different one.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.000
This process of discovery is
a wonderful adventure to be involved in.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.976
If the LHC finds particles
that fit this E8 pattern,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.600
that will be very, very cool.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.096
If the LHC finds new particles,
but they don't fit this pattern --

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.616
well, that will be very interesting,
but bad for this E8 theory.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.136
And, of course, bad for me personally.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.336
(Laughter)

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.136
Now, how bad would that be?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.256
Well, pretty bad.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.520
(Laughter)

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.200
But predicting how nature works
is a very risky game.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.160
This theory and others like it
are long shots.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.936
One does a lot of hard work
knowing that most of these ideas

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.136
probably won't end up
being true about nature.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.336
That's what doing
theoretical physics is like:

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.776
there are a lot of wipeouts.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.160
In this regard, new physics theories
are a lot like start-up companies.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.776
As with any large investment,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.696
it can be emotionally difficult
to abandon a line of research

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.016
when it isn't working out.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.096
But in science,
if something isn't working,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.320
you have to toss it out
and try something else.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.896
Now, the only way to maintain sanity

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.536
and achieve happiness
in the midst of this uncertainty

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.600
is to keep balance
and perspective in life.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.976
I've tried the best I can
to live a balanced life.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.880
(Laughter)

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.136
I try to balance my life equally
between physics, love and surfing --

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.976
my own three charge directions.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.136
(Laughter)

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.856
This way, even if the physics
I work on comes to nothing,

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.600
I still know I've lived a good life.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.136
And I try to live in beautiful places.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.216
For most of the past ten years
I've lived on the island of Maui,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.480
a very beautiful place.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.536
Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries
in the universe to my parents

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.416
how I managed to survive all that time

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.335
without engaging in anything
resembling full-time employment.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.319
(Laughter)

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.839
I'm going to let you in on that secret.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.520
This was a view
from my home office on Maui.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.760
And this is another,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.136
and another.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.176
And you may have noticed
that these beautiful views are similar,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.800
but in slightly different places.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.056
That's because this used to be
my home and office on Maui.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.856
(Laughter)

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.520
I've chosen a very unusual life.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.056
But not worrying about rent

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.240
allowed me to spend my time
doing what I love.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.496
Living a nomadic existence
has been hard at times,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.736
but it's allowed me
to live in beautiful places

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.736
and keep a balance in my life
that I've been happy with.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.120
It allows me to spend a lot of my time
hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.016
But I also greatly enjoy
the company of hyperintelligent people.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.421
So I'm very happy
to have been invited here to TED.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.536
Thank you very much.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:07.176
(Applause)

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.986
Chris Anderson: Stay here one second.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.592
(Applause)

00:18:12.616 --> 00:18:14.616
I probably understood two percent of that,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.240
but I still absolutely loved it.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.856
So I'm going to sound dumb.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.216
Your theory of everything --

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.816
Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.096
CA: That's right.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.456
The reason it's got
a few people at least excited

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.856
is because, if you're right, it brings
gravity and quantum theory together.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.696
So are you saying that we should
think of the universe, at its heart --

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.416
that the smallest things that there are,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.616
are somehow an E8 object of possibility?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.656
I mean, is there a scale to it,
at the smallest scale, or ...?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.536
GL: Well, right now
the pattern I showed you

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.176
that corresponds to what we know
about elementary particle physics --

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.616
that already corresponds
to a very beautiful shape.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.056
And that's the one
that I said we knew for certain.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.176
And that shape
has remarkable similarities --

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.040
and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,
which could be the rest of the picture.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.576
And these patterns of points
that I've shown for you

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.416
actually represent symmetries
of this high-dimensional object

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.216
that would be warping
and moving and dancing

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.336
over the space-time that we experience.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.016
And that would be what explains all these
elementary particles that we see.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.416
CA: But a string theorist,
as I understand it,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.456
explains electrons in terms
of much smaller strings vibrating --

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.776
I know, you don't like string theory --
vibrating inside it.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.616
How should we think
of an electron in relation to E8?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.040
GL: Well, it would be one
of the symmetries of this E8 shape.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.176
So what's happening is, as the shape
is moving over space-time, it's twisting.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.656
And the direction it's twisting
as it moves is what particle we see.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.896
So it would be --

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.096
CA: The size of the E8 shape,
how does that relate to the electron?

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.336
I feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.837
GL: As far as we know,
electrons are point particles,

00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:05.696
so this would be going down
to the smallest possible scales.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.536
So the way these things are explained
in quantum field theory is,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.216
all possibilities are expanding
and developing at once.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.280
And this is why
I use the analogy to coral.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.400
And --

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.896
in this way, the way that E8 comes in

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.360
is it will be as a shape that's attached
at each point in the space-time.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.736
And, as I said,
the way the shape twists --

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.256
the directional along which way
the shape is twisting

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.336
as it moves over this curved surface --

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.136
is what the elementary particles
are, themselves.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.816
So through quantum field theory,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.056
they manifest themselves as points
and interact that way.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.616
I don't know if I'll be able
to make this any clearer.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.576
(Laughter)

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.016
CA: It doesn't really matter.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.056
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.856
and I certainly
want to understand more of this.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.016
But thank you so much for coming.
That was absolutely fascinating.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.880
(Applause)
