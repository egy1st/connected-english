WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But what we're going to talk about today

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is really design. Really good designers are like sponges:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they really are curious

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and absorb every kind of information that comes their way,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so that gives me an opportunity,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because every design show that I curate

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
kind of looks at a different world. And it's great,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because it seems like every time I change jobs.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Design and the Elastic Mind."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The world that I decided to focus on this particular time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is the world of science and the world of technology.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Technology always comes into play when design is involved,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but science does a little less.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and transforming them so that we can use them.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And this is what this exhibition looks at.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you think about your life today,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you go every day through many different scales,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
many different changes of rhythm and pace.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
others are a little slower,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Other people are not as elastic.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And that's because there's some little bit of fear,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
these kinds of discomforts that we have,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and try to make life easier for us.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we really need, we really cherish and we really work on.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And this exhibition is about the work of designers

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that help us be more elastic,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and also of designers that really work on this elasticity

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
as an opportunity. And one last thing is that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and into the preview, I would like to point out

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
this beautiful detail about scientists and design.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You can say that the relationship between science and design

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
goes back centuries. You can of course talk about

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and there's a gigantic history behind it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But according to a really great science historian you might know,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
have brought to designers is this renewed interest,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
this real passion for design.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
just like designers are seeking scientists.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that's now a multimedia company, you might know it --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we founded about a year ago a monthly salon

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you know, scientists would tell designers,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
they really started talking each others' language,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in London at the Serpentine.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And it's really interesting to see how this happens.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The exhibition will talk about the work

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of both designers and scientists,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm showing to you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
different sections of the show right now,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just to give you a taste of it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
have really opened the designer's mind.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
A lot of the objects in the show are concepts,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is the work of some scientists from UCLA.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
from the Royal College of Arts in London

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
New sensing elements on the body --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you can grow hairs on your nails,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
They seem very, very obsessed

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
with finding out more about the ideal mate.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Very interesting. This is a typeface designer

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
from Israel who has designed -- he calls them "typosperma."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in order to make them become -- to almost have a song

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, tissue design.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And so, the assignment to the students was,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
how should the steak of tomorrow be?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
what should it be like?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So this particular student, James King,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
went around the beautiful English countryside,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
picked the best, best cow that he could see,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and then put her in the MRI machine.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but you know, in the future it could be made better --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Instead, this element here is much more banal.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Something that you know can be done already

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
This is SymbioticA, and they've been working --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to be wearing everything leather in the future.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
as anything in our life today,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and at different levels.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
One of the most interesting and most important concepts

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is the idea of scale. We change scale very often:

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we change resolution of screens, and

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So you go, even in the exhibition,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to the manipulation of really great amounts of data --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
In this particular case a section will be devoted

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to information design.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
with all the go-to, go-back-to,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
also made into a beautiful choreography.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And then also graphs by scientists,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the fact that many scientists

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So they pick the worst background

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's only recently that this kind of marriage

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
if we can say so -- scientific presentations.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Another aspect of contemporary design

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that I think is mind-opening, promising

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and will really be the future of design,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
is the idea of collective design.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, the more the merrier.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The more computers, the stronger the signal,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and children work on the interface so that it's all based

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
on doing things together, tasks together.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So the idea of collective design

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
is something that will become even bigger in the future,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and this is chosen as an example.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is the idea of existence maximum.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That's a term that I coined a few years ago

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
while I was thinking of how pressed we are together,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and at the same time how these small objects,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
like the Walkman first and then the iPod,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
create bubbles of space around us that enable us

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to have a metaphysical space

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that is much bigger than our physical space.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and have your own room in your iPod.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And this is the work of several designers

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
by means of various techniques.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to have a private conversation anywhere

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with this perfect temperature, and you can have

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
this isolation tank phone conversation

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It's actually already used by the military a little bit,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
with your senses while you're removed from it physically.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
so if you're too shy to be really at the date,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you can stay at a distance with your flowers

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and somebody else reenacts the date for you.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Rapid manufacturing is another big area

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
in which technology and design are, I think,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Rapid manufacturing is a computer file

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it was machines carving out of a foam block

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
a model that was very, very fragile,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and could not have any real use.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Techniques became better -- not only carving

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to the point that now we can have actual chairs

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
made by rapid manufacturing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
customize your chair. You know, companies and designers

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
will be designing the matrix or the margins

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
not only regarding the participation of the final buyer

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
in the design process, but also no tracking,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
no warehousing, no wasted materials.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
will have to retool their own business plans

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and print your own basketball.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
which is very interesting.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Mapping and tagging.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in order to then retrace our path.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Also, we do it in order to share with other people.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Again, this communal sense of experience

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that seems to be so important today.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So, various ways to map and tag

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
are also the work of many designers nowadays.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And also animal senses in a way.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
This particular object that many people love so much

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And so this student at the RCA

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
designed this beautiful blown-glass object

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
where the bees move from one chamber to the other

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
if they detect that particular smell

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Another shape is made for cancer.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that designers have really shaped for themselves.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Some designers don't design objects, products,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
things that we're going to actually use,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
They're still very useful.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
They help companies and other designers think better about the future.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And usually they are accompanied by videos.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We always think that robots will take care of us,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
for about five minutes before it does something.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So it's really a way to make us think more

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
about what robots mean to us.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the idea is that when you lose your loved one

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
or you go through a bad breakup,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
what you miss the most are those annoying things

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that you used to hate when you were with the other person.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So he designed all these series of accessories.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There's another one that throws plates and breaks them.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Elio Caccavale: he took the idea

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
of those dolls that explain leukemia.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that explain to children where babies come from today.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
in-vitro -- there's the whole idea

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of how babies can be made today that has changed.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
One of the most beautiful things

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is that designers really work on life,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
even though they take technology into account.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And many designers have been working recently

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
on the idea of death and mourning,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and what we can do about it today with new technologies.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Or how we should behave about it with new technologies.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
These three objects over there are hard drives

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
that contain the whole desktop and computer memory

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of somebody who passed away.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So instead of having only the pictures,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
you will be able to put this object next to the computer

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and all of a sudden have, you know,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Gertrude's whole life and all of her files

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and her address book come alive.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So to give them something tangible that shows that

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
there is something after death, they take the gastric juices

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
of people who passed away and concentrate them,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and put them into a battery that can actually be used

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
of where the world is going.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Thank you very much.
