00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You all know this story.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the summer of 1950,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and atomic-pile builder,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"Where is everybody?"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This confused his colleagues, obviously,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because they were sitting right there with him.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He was talking about the space aliens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You see, this was only a few years after

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the supposed flying saucer crash

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
at Roswell, New Mexico.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And even though that turned out to be nothing,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
nothing at all --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter) --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
merely a downed weather balloon

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
piloted by small hairless men

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with slits for mouths ...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Still, America had gone saucer-mad,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
even famous scientists

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
who were eating lunch.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is that the universe is so vast

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that it stands to reason,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there should be other intelligent life out there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the universe is so old

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we should have some evidence of their existence by now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and his colleagues had no answer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to disprove fairies,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Sasquatch, God,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the possibility of love --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and thereafter, as you know,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Enrico Fermi ate alone.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I am not a scientist.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I have never built an atomic pile.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Although, I might argue that, technically,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
every pile is atomic.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
One is that the aliens might be

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
very far away.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Perhaps, I dare say,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
even on other planets.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The other possibility --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter) --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was an alien.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Think about it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Isn't it a little convenient

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
suddenly an Italian scientist showed up

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
with an amazing new technology

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that would transform everything in the world

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and darken the history of the human species forever after?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And isn't it a little strange

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that he required no payment for this?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That he asked for only one thing --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
a gift of two healthy sperm whales?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That's -- that's not true.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But it is strange.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
his fellow scientists

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that the space aliens are not already here?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
For it is given in certain UFO-ology

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
or UFOlogy circles,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that they have walked among us in disguise,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
observing us, guiding our evolution

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
from ape to man --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
if you believe in that sort of thing --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Laughter)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's a difficult theory to discount,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I think you'll agree.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
(Laughter)

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
For even in my own life,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
there are memories I have

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that are difficult to explain --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that it is difficult to imagine

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
they were not the result

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
For how else will you explain

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the amazing and absolutely true

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
close encounters that I had

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and will describe to you now?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
This was the summer when the special edition of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And so I spent the rest of the vacation

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the sidewalk still warm from the sun,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
watching the skies for UFOs.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
What did I see? Stars, satellites,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Occasionally, kids would come and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
join me and watch,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to play video games and mingle with humans.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
so I stayed alone with the cosmos.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And that's when it happened.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
An elderly couple came walking down the street.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I would say they were in their late seventies,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and I would say that they were on a date,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
because he was wearing a very neat little suit

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and a chill was coming in off the ocean.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I remember, for some reason,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that they were exactly the same height.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And then they stopped, and the man turned to me

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and said,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
"What are you looking for,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
flying saucers?"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
for an old man on a date.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But what was stranger still --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and even I realized it at the time,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
as a nine-year-old child --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
was that they stopped at all.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with his sweetheart with the precise reason

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
of making fun of a child.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
"Oh," he said,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
"little green men."

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And then his girlfriend joined in, too.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
"There's no such thing as space men," she said.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"There's no such thing."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I looked around.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The street was entirely empty.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It was as though time had stopped.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I did not know why they were teasing me.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I looked into their strangely angry faces,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I remember wondering,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
are they wearing rubber masks?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Slits for mouths?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and then he made laser sounds.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"Kew, kew, kew --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
watch out."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And they turned at once and walked away.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The old man reached out

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
his knobbly claw

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
for the woman's hand,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and found it, and left me alone.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a strange encounter among humans.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Maybe it was swamp gas, but --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Laughter) --

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I know what I saw.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I went to see the movie "Dune,"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
(Laughter) --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
this is impossible on its face, I realize --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but it is absolutely true.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It was opening night, naturally.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
On my right was the girl in question.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
She was very tall, I would say.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I didn't know her name, and I never will.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They were both big fans, mother and daughter --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
very unusual.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
They were talking about how their favorite characters

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
were the giant sandworms.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And then it got stranger.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That's when she turned to me and said,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Laughter)

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
First of all, I was embarrassed

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I was merely a connoisseur of movies

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
featuring desert planets, as I still am.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
(Laughter)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
as though she just wanted to talk to me.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I did not even turn my head.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The movie began.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
in which all of the characters

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
were sexy and deformed at the same time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of psychedelic spice

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
swirling around him,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
allowing him to bend space and time.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
He could never leave the tank

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
or interact with the outside world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
He had become, in his isolation,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
so deformed and so sexy,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to the outside world, and could never touch them.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Please.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
When the movie ended,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
everyone seemed very happy

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Except for the girl.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
As I walked out, her pace slowed.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Perhaps it was the crutches,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
but it seemed --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Laughter) --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but I can only come to the conclusion

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that it was what, in the alien abductee community,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
they call a "screen memory":

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and flown off to a sex pyramid.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
(Laughter)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And so I sure am glad

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I did not slow down to talk to her.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I sure am glad I never saw her again.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
1989.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
In the mid-to-late '80s,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in which he described his own lifelong experiences

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
being abducted by aliens.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
as "lost time,"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
were taking him and giving him rectal probes.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and was his, sort of, police sketch

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of what the creatures looked like

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that Whitley Strieber had described to him.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And in 1989, the way I remember it,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I was in Philadelphia

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
One: Whitley Strieber

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
was played by Christopher Walken.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
(Laughter)

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Three: there was a surprisingly long

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Four: this was being shown

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Five: all of which is to say,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and it starred Christopher Walken.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Does something seem strange about this to you?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Think about it. Yes. The answer is:

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I had a girlfriend. What?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
(Laughter)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
How did this happen? When did this happen?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I remember walking out of the theater

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
as we walked hand in hand,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and pondering these very same questions.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And to this day, I have no answer for you.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Close encounter four: the Algarve,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Portugal, 1991.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Some years later, I and this woman --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
(Laughter) --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
went traveling through the south of Portugal together.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in tiny little hotels,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and watch the sun set and play checkers.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We went to some topless beaches.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Excuse me? No, not in my life.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and the lead dog bit me on the ass,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and receive an ass shot.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Make of that what you will.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
(Laughter)

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Our last day in Portugal,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
we were in the district capital of Faro,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
one last time.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now, Faro is a bustling little city,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a bus and then a boat.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And did I want to come with?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I remember what she looked like before she left.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The freckles had grown

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and multiplied on her face and shoulders,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
clustering into a kind of a tan.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
A tan, we were both tan --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is this true?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
She was smiling.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
not even speaking the language,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to travel alone by bus and boat

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to go to a beach she did not know

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
or had never seen.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I loved her, and then she went out

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
into that strange, alien land.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It took me some time to come to my senses.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I had my own "lost time" moment,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
where I woke up and suddenly realized

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and she had not come back.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Now, I did not speak Portuguese.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I did not know where the beach was.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
(Laughter)

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I realized that the day would only have

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
two possible outcomes:

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
either Catherine would come back to the hotel,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
or she would never come back to the hotel.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And so I sat down to wait.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
where the buses and cars and pedestrians

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and little scooters were moving along.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I watched those constellations shift,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
hoping that they would part and I would see her face.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It was at that moment,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in that very small town of 30,000 or so,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and the searching we might do in it.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And that's when the Liberians came along.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
what was I doing, and I explained.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But he did not seem so very sure,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
for he sat down to wait with me.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
telling me jokes, distracting me.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Two hours, they gave me a message.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We are not alone.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I turned and looked down the street.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
The stars aligned, and she came back.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Neither did the Liberians,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and left us alone in the street, holding hands.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
much like a piece of alien technology

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that has been inserted into your buttocks

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
by a "Portuguese doctor."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Laughter)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And even now, a decade and a half later,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
even now that we are married,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
that during the time she was away,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I love her and wait for her still.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Thank you for your kind attention.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Applause)
