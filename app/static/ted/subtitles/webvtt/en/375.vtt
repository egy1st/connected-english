00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it comes in a male form, too --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
very glamorous.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
there actually is a little wine in there --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and of course, always wears a tuxedo.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but also comes in other forms.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A magazine?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, it's certainly not this one.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Sex tips are not glamorous.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is not glamorous either.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But there is a glamour of industry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is Margaret Bourke-White's --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
one of her pictures she did.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Fantastic, glamorous pictures

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And there's the mythic glamour

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of the garage entrepreneur.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There's the glamour of physics.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
he has other kinds of glamour.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And there is, of course, this glamour.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and not the alien-style glamour,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but the nice, clean, early '60s version.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So what do we mean by glamour?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is you can look in the dictionary.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in this case the 1913 dictionary.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You had "a" glamour.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Glamour was a literal magic spell.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and to some extent, Celtic magic.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
it started to take on this other kind of deception --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But still, glamour is an illusion.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Glamour is a magic spell.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And there's something dangerous about glamour

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
on you, it was not in your self-interest --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
it was to get you to act against your interest.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well of course, in the 20th century,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And this is Hedy Lamarr.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
they call them false color.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Glamour is a form of falsification,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And it involves a great deal of technique.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's not -- glamour is not something --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and it's not just the case for people.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Glamour doesn't have to be people.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Architectural photography --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It puts you into this special, special world.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This is Alex Ross's comic book art,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which appears to be extremely realistic,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
When you stack people in rows,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but not in the world of glamour.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in the table of contents of New York magazine,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which was telling us that glamour is back --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
glamour is all about transcending the everyday.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that combines all sorts of glamour is.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I don't know who she is either,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It's a very glamorous portrait.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Why is it glamorous?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but that does not make you glamorous,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that only makes you beautiful.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and those are the central qualities of glamour.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
She's not looking away from you exactly,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but you have to mentally imagine her world.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
That's glamour:

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Glamour invites us to live in a different world.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that's why, often in these glamour shots,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the person is not looking at the audience,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's why sunglasses are glamorous --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In some sense, there has to be something like us.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
omniscient -- too far above us.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
but it has to have this transcendent quality.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
What is it about Superman?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Glamour is all about transcending this world

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and getting to an idealized, perfect place.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And this is one reason that modes of transportation

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
tend to be extremely glamorous.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The less experience we have with them,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the more glamorous they are.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The notion is that it's going to transport you,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The story is about where you're arriving,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or thinking about where you're arriving.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And this sense of being transported

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is one reason that we have glamour styling.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
because we associate it with movies of that period, but because,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
because, to me, it captures the whole promise

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
of the academic contemplative life --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
city streets -- not so glamorous.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
except, possibly, multiple horizons.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
you just see the possibilities.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
after a few centuries.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It makes things look effortless.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
she just looks completely natural.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Of course, they covered that with make-up,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Glamour is about editing.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
How do you create the sense of transcendence,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the sense of evoking a perfect world?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We don't tell you all the grubby details.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
This is underneath Jeff's desk.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
This is what the real world of computers,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But if you look in a catalog --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it looks like this.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
There are no cords.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
you don't get to live in the world without cords.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And there she is -- Grace.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Translucence is glamorous --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that's why all these people wear pearls.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
not transparent, not opaque.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It invites us into the world

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It has that sense of going up and away,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and yet you never think about how you would really trip

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
if you were -- particularly going down.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
but glamour's really partly about meaning.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
All individuals and all cultures have ideals

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that cannot possibly be realized in reality.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They have contradictions,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
to our lives as cultures and as individuals.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And the way we deal with that is we displace them --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
an age of heroes, the world to come.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
The white picket fence, the perfect house.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
the perfect diamond ring.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The perfect getaway in your perfect car.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The perfect office --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
again, no cords, as far as I can tell.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I mean, there's no paper on the desk.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
We want this golden world.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And some people get rich enough,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
they get to acquire their perfect world.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Is it something important?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It was criticized for glamorizing violence,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that are impossible in the real world.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You know, we're marching toward Utopia.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Because what they're doing is they're saying,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But actually, what's even more important

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
brilliant editing to cut together things.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There's a glamour shot.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
National Socialism is all about glamour.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It was a very aesthetic ideology.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and ridding it of anything unglamorous.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So glamour can be dangerous.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I'm not against glamour.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and confront the manipulation of it all,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but also enjoy how it happens.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And here's Hedy Lamarr.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
even though she thought she could look stupid.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
which only took a fraction of a second to happen.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
There is a book out in the bookstore --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
it's called "Symphony In Steel,"

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And that has a fascination.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But I also knew how hard they worked all week.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
when you realize what went into creating it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Thank you.
