00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This session is on natural wonders,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want to try to combine them all,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and much more quickly than people had once realized,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I love doing this work, because it really gives many people

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but that happiness is not --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we're talking about the pursuit of happiness,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom,"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it’s really about -- our nature is to be happy;

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so it’s not something -- happiness is not something you get,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
health is generally not something that you get.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But rather all of these different practices --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
didn’t develop these techniques to just manage stress

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
even though it can do all those things.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They’re powerful tools for transformation,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for quieting down our mind and bodies

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to be peaceful, to be joyful

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and to realize that it’s not something that you pursue and get,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but rather it’s something that you have already until you disturb it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and people would say, "What are you, a Hindu?" He’d say, "No, I’m an undo."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it’s really about identifying what’s causing us

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to disturb our innate health and happiness,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and then to allow that natural healing to occur.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
To me, that’s the real natural wonder.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, within that larger context,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we can talk about diet, stress management --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which are really these spiritual practices --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
moderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which I’ll talk more about -- and some vitamins and supplements.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And it’s not a diet.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You know, when most people think about the diet I recommend,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
they think it’s a really strict diet.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
For reversing disease, that’s what it takes,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but if you’re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you’re going to live longer, you’re going to feel better,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you’re going to lose weight, and so on.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And in our studies, what we’ve been able to do

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We first began by looking at heart disease,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in many cases it could get better and better,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and much more quickly than people had once realized.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is a representative patient who at the time was 73 --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
totally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and you can see the narrowing here.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
A year later, it’s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
These minor changes in blockages

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and using cardiac positron emission tomography, or "PET," scans,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
blue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Huge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Clinically, he literally couldn’t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain;

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
within a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
climbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This is not unusual, and it’s part of what enables people

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to maintain these kinds of changes,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Overall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
they got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This is the natural history of heart disease,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but it’s really not natural because we found it could get better and better,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and much more quickly than people had once thought.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We also found that the more people change, the better they got.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It wasn’t a function of how old or how sick they were --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it was mainly how much they changed,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
from two of the patients in one of our programs.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The younger brother is 86, the older one’s 95;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You just never know.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
start to reverse the progression of their heart disease.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It’s important, but not enough.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Because we doctors do what we get paid to do,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and we get trained to do what we get paid to do,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Insurance will cover the bypass, it’ll cover the angioplasty;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
it won’t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So, we began through our nonprofit institute's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
training hospitals around the country,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and we found that most people could avoid surgery,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the insurance companies found

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
where they’re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on the sites that we train.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because there’s not as much to tell." (Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I like this slide, because it’s a chance to talk about

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
what really motivates people to change, and what doesn’t.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And what doesn’t work is fear of dying,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and that’s what’s normally used.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Everybody who smokes knows it’s not good for you,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and still 30 percent of Americans smoke --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Well, because it helps them get through the day.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I’ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
As one woman said, "I’ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and they’re always there for me and nobody else is.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You’re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Or they eat when they get depressed,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
or they use alcohol to numb the pain,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or they work too hard, or watch too much TV.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And the pain is not the problem: it’s the symptom.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And telling people they’re going to die is too scary to think about,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
or, they’re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and so they don’t want to think about it, so they don’t.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it’s not emphysema.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
What was the biggest selling drug of all time

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
when it was introduced a few years ago?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Viagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It’s not like you say, "Hey Joe, I’m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?"

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It’s not so much psychological, it’s vascular,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and nicotine makes your arteries constrict.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
lethargic, depressed and impotent, and that’s not much fun.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you think more clearly, you have more energy,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
your heart gets more blood in ways I’ve shown you.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Your sexual function improves.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and you’ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
When you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
On a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn’t go down -- it even goes up.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Many of you have kids, and you know that’s a big change in your lifestyle,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they’re worth it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and you feel so much better so quickly.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
For many people, those are choices worth making --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
not to live longer, but to live better.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
because it really is a problem.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It’s no joke: it’s real.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but it doesn’t last, which is the problem.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now, there’s no mystery in how you lose weight;

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
or if you restrict entire categories of foods.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But the problem is, you get hungry, so it’s hard to keep it off.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The other way is to change the type of food.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And fat has nine calories per gram,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
whereas protein and carbs only have four.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So you can eat the same amount of food, but you’ll be getting fewer calories

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
because the food is less dense in calories.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And it’s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You know, I don’t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and so I just thought I’d spend a few minutes on that.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The myth that you hear about is,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Americans have been told to eat less fat,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the percent of calories from fat is down,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn’t make you fat.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It’s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the "bad carbs," and these are things like --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Laughter)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
-- sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
you get all these calories that don’t fill you up because you’ve removed the fiber,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
these are not health foods --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
but to go from "bad carbs" to what are called "good carbs."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and it slows the absorption so you don’t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So, and you get all the disease-protective substances.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
It’s not just what you exclude from your diet,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but also what you include that’s protective.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
You find these, for example, in fish oil.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and saturated fats, which we find in meat.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If you don’t remember anything else from this talk,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Three grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
more than that just gives you extra fat you don’t need.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
like breast, prostate and colon cancer.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Now, the problem with the Atkins diet,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
everybody knows people who have lost weight on it,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren’t good for you.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
rather than the one that harms it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And the problem is that it’s based on this half-truth,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
so if you eat fewer simple carbs you’re going to lose weight.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You’ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and you’ll enhance your health rather than harming it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
He says, "I’ve got some good news.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
While your cholesterol level has remained the same,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
the research findings have changed."

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
(Laughter)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The red is good at the beginning, and a year later --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
this is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
there’s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
there’s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn’t happy.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Now, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
found that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
54 percent had headaches – this is not a healthy way to eat.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
but when they get too close it’s going to be a problem.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And that’s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
your bowels and your perspiration.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And then, again, it’s a spectrum:

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
when you move in this direction, you’re going to lose weight,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
you’re going to feel better and you’re going to gain health.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Now, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
whether it’s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now, we’re about to publish the first study

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We could randomly divide them into two groups,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and then we could have one group

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that is a non-intervention control group to compare to,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
which we can’t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
What we found was that, after a year,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
none of the experimental group patients

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
When we looked at their PSA levels -- which is a marker for prostate cancer --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
they got worse in the control group,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
but they actually got better in the experimental group,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and these differences were highly significant.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And then I wondered: was there any relationship

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
whichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I then wondered, well, maybe they’re just changing their PSA,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but it’s not really affecting the tumor growth.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and it inhibited the growth seven times more

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And finally, I said, I wonder if there’s any relationship between

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
whichever group they happened to be in.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And this really got me excited because again,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
we found the same pattern: the more people change,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the more it affected the growth of their tumors.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and you can see clearly it’s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So, if it’s true for prostate cancer, it’ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And whether or not you have conventional treatment,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
is that study after study have shown

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
that people who are lonely and depressed --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture --

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
in part because, as we talked about, they’re more likely to smoke

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But also, through mechanisms that we don’t fully understand,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
people who are lonely and depressed are many times --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
three to five to ten times, in some studies --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
more likely to get sick and die prematurely.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Now, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It can be sexual intimacy –

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
are just different forms of the same thing.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Friendship, altruism, compassion, service – all the perennial truths that we talked about

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that are part of all religion and all cultures --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
once you stop trying to see the differences,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
these are the things in our own self-interest,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
because they free us from our suffering and from disease.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And it’s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
He took women with metastatic breast cancer,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
randomly divided them into two groups.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It was a nurturing, loving environment,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
with people who understood, because they were going through it too.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
They just met once a week for a year.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Five years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and that was the only difference between the groups.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Other studies have shown this as well.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and even the word healing, it comes from the root "to make whole."

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
meaning "union, to yoke, to bring together."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And the last slide I want to show you is from -- I was -- again,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
this swami that I studied with for so many years, and I

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And at the end of it, somebody said,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
"Hey, Swami, what’s the difference between wellness and illness?"

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word "illness,"

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and circled the first letter, and then wrote the word "wellness,"

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and circled the first two letters ...

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
To me, it’s just shorthand for what we’re talking about:

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
that anything that creates a sense of connection

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and community and love is really healing.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Thank you. (Applause)
