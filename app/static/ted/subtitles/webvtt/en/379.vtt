00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ...

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, it's the era of a lot of different things

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that we're in right now. But one thing for sure:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's the era of change. There's more change going on

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so that you really understand it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
since I was born. When you have a new baby,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
by the time that kid gets out of high school

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is unprecedented, and it's big.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, the third curve is information technology.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of information, but it has been pretty good for showing

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
a lot of other things about information technology --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
This is the size of the earth going through that same --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
(Laughter)

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There's no need to see the little detailed words on it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That first one is humans-versus-nature;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we've won, there's no more gain. Human population.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
transported, housed and so on. And the information technology,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's just going up through the roof.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, that's the stage out of all this. I find,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
economically, it's achievable; politically,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The institutions of the past with all their inertia

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and whatever else we devote ourselves to.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
which is putting information and dogma into them,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
think broadly or creative. They can be.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
for the things that are important in life

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
or for the survival of civilization; they reward you

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We can't go into that today because there isn't time --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
with more efficiency using less energy, less material.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
in this direction in 1976 and 77,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
winning the Kremer prize in aviation history,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
followed by the Albatross. And we began

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
making various odd planes and creatures.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This was the full size of the original creature.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We did things on land, in the air, on water --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
whether its land, air or water.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
165 miles carrying a person from France to England

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
into turning it into a commercial product.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
which shows a little airplane for surveillance

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and moving to a giant airplane.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
They are powered only by the energy

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they can extract from the atmosphere --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
(Music)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that photovoltaic cells can produce real power

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and will be part of the world's energy future.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
solely on the power of sunbeams,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and established a basis for the Pathfinder.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Music)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
gains that can help us attain a desirable balance

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
between technology and nature. The stakes are high

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as we speed toward a challenging future.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
can and must do more with less -- much less."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000
the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
after it had just flown to 71,530 feet --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and with wonderful results like that flight.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
(Music)

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
There he's the project manager. Anything they do

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Music)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
this is starting --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
while the plane is flying. And it's exploring

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and permits life on earth to be the success that it is --

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
probing that is very important. And also we consider it

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But now let's look at the other end.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
surveillance drone that Keenan has developed

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
all right

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
looking out of its camera.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and be able to fly the plane better.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Here we go.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
(Applause)

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
there it goes.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We get to do the classic.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
All right.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
If this hits you, it will not hurt you.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
(Laughter)

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
OK.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:40.000
(Applause)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000
(Applause)

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But now, as they say in infomercials,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
we have something much better for you, which we're working on:

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
with just a little battery in it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
But there's a lot of technology going.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
This one doesn't have the video in it,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
but you get a little feel from what it can do.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
OK, here we go.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
(Laughter)

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
MK: Sorry.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
OK.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
(Applause)

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
(Laughter)

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
But you're beginning to see what can be done.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
that are way beyond existing technology,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
You can do amazing things when you realize

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
but when you get down to the nature's realm,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
nature has 200 million years of experience.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
you don't leave any progeny.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We should have nothing but success stories from nature,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
from its fascinating subjects.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and had it say what I wanted.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Things are going on this decade, next decade;

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
not a forecast. That was before --

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And so where it all goes, I don't know.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
is an utterly impractical flight vehicle,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
(Applause)

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
(Laughter)

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
(Applause)

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
We can probably get it down,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
(Laughter)

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
(Applause)

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
just --

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
(Applause)

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
on zero-emission vehicles in California.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
like they're trying to get in education systems.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
and puts it all together in things that are --

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
that make this conference, I think, more important than any

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
that's taken place in this country in this decade.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Thank you. (Applause)
