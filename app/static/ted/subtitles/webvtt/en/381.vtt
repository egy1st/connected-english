00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is HIV positive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He liked to sit on her lap

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and he asked me for slippers,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because he said that his feet were cold.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Single mother, HIV positive.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I photographed her before and after

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
at the age of 23.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
like so many other Zimbabwean children

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who've been orphaned by the epidemic.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So a few of the stories.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
With every picture,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
there are individuals who have full lives

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and stories that deserve to be told.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
CA: Just --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
for a fashion photographer.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I was constantly reading the New York Times,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It was just frightening.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I quit my job

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
this is in December 2000 --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and then went back again this March 2002

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
CA: That's an amazing story, thank you.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.
