00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This means, "I'm smiling."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So does that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This means "mouse."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
"Cat."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here we have a story.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The start of the story, where this means guy,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's where it happens.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These are when.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She wears it every day.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not considered vintage --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's because she dances.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or "I heart you!"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"I'm laughing out loud."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"I want to give you a hug."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But he comes up with that, you know.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Put a crab inside it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Add some water.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Seven different salts.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but just panhandle at the ocean.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
At least, that's how it seems.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm a monkey --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
blowing kisses

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
at a butterfly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
First, soon, and then a lot.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Hell, ponytail alone.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I don't know what else to tell you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I got a pencil you can borrow.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You can put it in your phone."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
She just says, "No thank you."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You know?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Applause)
