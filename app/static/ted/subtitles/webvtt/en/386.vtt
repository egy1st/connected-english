00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I usually stand on the other side of the light,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The previous speaker has, I think,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
really painted a very good background as to

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and trying to find the answer to the big questions.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What have you done with so many years of being away?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we expected huge masterpieces!"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
just in a reduced, small version.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In a way, I feel like that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a handful of films -- nothing much,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
two feature films and a handful of short films.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, we’ll go with the first piece.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I love her, you know.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
She’s not even my real mum.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
My real mum and dad dumped me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and fucked off back to Nigeria.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The devil is in me, Court.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Court: Sleep.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Woman: Have you ever been?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Court: Where?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Woman: Nigeria.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Court: Never.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My mum wanted to,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
couldn’t afford it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Woman: Wish I could.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I have this feeling I’d be happy there.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Why does everyone get rid of me?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Woman: You don't need me.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You’re just too blind to see it now.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Boy: What do you do all day?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Marcus: Read.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Boy: Don't you get bored?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Marcus: I am retired.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Boy: So?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Marcus: Because I do what I like?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Boy: Yeah.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Marcus: A modern day poet.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Marcus: So what do you talk about?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Boy: Reality, man.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Marcus: Whose reality?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Boy: My fuckin' reality.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Marcus: With an AK-47?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Marcus: The Panthers.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Boy: Panthers?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Director 1: I saw his last film.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Épuise, right?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Woman 1: Yes.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Director 2: Can you not shut up?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Let’s go.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
W1: They suck.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
What, what, what, what about, what?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
What do you think about your movie?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to go and film something real?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You make people fuckin' sleep.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Dream about bullshit.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
(Applause)

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I've been away 20 years in total.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And so it’s really --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, for this girl to have these dreams

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because you just need something to hold on to,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
especially in a society where you feel alienated.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and his reality.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And what would a child --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
What happens with that?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
What, of course, happens with that is violence,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
which we see when we talk about the ghettos

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
like the one in France two years ago, where I live,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
France is a liberal society."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But I lived in England for 18 years.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
thrown back 20 years, living in France.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I suppose that will take me to my last piece --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
what cinema means for me.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and it was three years of war.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So that whole thing,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Onicha: Yes, mama.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
so you must get ready and willing to die.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
You must get -- ?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
CS: The barrel of the gun!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
C: This is the gun.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
CS: This is the gun.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Amphetamines.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We went from one village to another -- three villages.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I don’t remember how we got there.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We didn't eat.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
There was no food, just little rice.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Without food -- I was sick.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The injection made us not to have mind.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
God will forgive us.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
He knows we did not know. We did not know!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Ezra: I don’t remember.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Various Voices: You will die! You will die! (Screaming)

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
♫ No more trouble ♫

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They killed my mother.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The Mende sons of bastards.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
(Shouting)

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Who is she?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Me.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Why you giving these to me?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So you can stop staring at me.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
My story is a little bit complicated.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I’m interested.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Mariam is pregnant.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You know what you are? A crocodile.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Big mouth. Short legs.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
He’s not taking care of his troops.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Open your eyes, Ezra.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Get that idiot out!

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I take you are preparing a major attack?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This must be the mine.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Your girl is here.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Well done, well done.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
That is what you are here for, no?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You are planning to go back to fight are you?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
♫ No more trouble ♫

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:13.000
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
♫ No more trouble. ♫

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
♫ We don't need no more ... ♫

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The beginning of hope.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
State your name and age for the commission.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
(Sister: 16.)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
for any crimes you committed.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
E: We were fighting for our freedom.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
If killing in a war is a crime,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
then you have to charge every soldier in the world.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You too are a retired General, not so?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
CC: Yes, correct.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
E: So you too must stand trial then.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Our government was corrupt.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Lack of education was their way to control power.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
CC: No, we don’t.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
E: You are richer than us.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But we pay for school.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Your country talks about democracy,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
but you support corrupt governments like my own.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Why? Because you want our diamond.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
No.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You are not on trial.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
E: Then let me go.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
CC: I can't do that, son.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
E: So you are a liar.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(Applause)

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
is that while we’re making all these huge advancements,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should --

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Africa should move forward, but we should remember,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
so we do not go back here again.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Thank you.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
(Applause)

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
One of the themes that comes through very strongly

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000
in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that have to play this role of being child soldiers.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And considering where you are coming from,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
as it should be, what would you have to say about that?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
ex-combatants, as they like to be called.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
if any kid in the West, in the western world,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So for me, the thought that we have all these children --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children --

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and Africa has to live with that.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But I’m just saying to factor that in,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
factor that in with all this great advancement,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
all this pronouncement of great achievement.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
That’s really my thinking.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
That was a very moving piece.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
NA: Thank you.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
EO: Thank you.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
(Applause)
