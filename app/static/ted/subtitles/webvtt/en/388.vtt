00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think the future of this planet depends on humans,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
not technology, and we already have the knowledge --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But we’re nowhere near the endgame

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
when it comes to our perception.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We still have one foot in the dark ages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And when you listen to some of the presentations here --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then you contrast it with the fact

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we have one foot in the dark ages.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It’s not flat, stupid, it’s round."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is an ocean planet.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
T.S. Eliot really said it for me --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and this should give you goose bumps:

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"we shall not cease from exploration

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the end of our exploring shall be to return

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
where we started and know the place for the first time."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
where the last of earth discovered

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
is that which is the beginning."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So I have one message.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For the rocketeers in the audience:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I admire the courage -- but your rockets

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And it’s all a question of perspective.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let me try and tell you --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I don’t mean to insult you, but look,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
if I -- and I’m not doing this for real

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because it would be an insult,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I held up another square that was the root two square --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans;

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, it’s the relative importance.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But it’s a question of perception,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and if that’s what you’re thinking,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
if that’s what you think I mean when I say,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If you think that that’s the relative importance,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but you sound like it when you say "Earth,"

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because that demonstration, if I turned around this way --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that earth plane would be as thin as paper.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The ocean representation would have a depth to it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And if you hefted those two things

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It turns out that something more than

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The problem we have in believing that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is -- you just have to give up this notion

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that this Earth was created for us.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Because it’s a problem we have.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If this is an ocean planet

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and we only have a small minority of this planet,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Okay. Let me criticize this thing.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I’m not talking about James Cameron --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
although I could, but I won’t.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You really do have to go and see his latest film,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
"Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It features two of these deep rovers,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
classic submersibles built.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
This is an acryclic sphere.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It generates all of the buoyancy,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
all of the payload for the craft,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and the batteries are down here hanging underneath,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
exactly like a balloon.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And this one actually carries two great manipulators.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It actually is a very good working sub --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that’s what it was designed for.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The problem with it is --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and the reason I will never build another one like it --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
we take all our terrestrial hang-ups,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
all our constraints -- importantly,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
these two-dimensional constraints that we have,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and we take them underwater.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
A seat works in a two-dimensional world,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And in a two-dimensional world,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
we do know about the third dimension

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but we don’t use it because to go up

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And then our mothers tell us,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
"Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water;

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
which is alien to us.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Fish do not sit in seats.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"Careful you don’t fall over."

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They live in a three-dimensional world

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
where there is no difference in energy

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
between going this way, that way, that way or that way.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It’s truly a three-dimensional space.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I don’t know of any other submersible,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
or even remote, that just takes advantage

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that this is a three-dimensional space.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
This is the way we should be going into the oceans.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is a three-dimensional machine.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and move in this three-dimensional space.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
OK, this is good stuff.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
She has twice the wingspan that I do.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
There I’m coming; she sees me.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And just notice how she rolls under and turns;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And the craft that I’m in --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
this hasn’t been shown before.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I wanted you to notice

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that she actually turned to come back up.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
There I am; I see her coming back,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
coming up underneath me.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I’m trying to do everything very gently.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
She gets about that close and then she pulls away.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
This was a fly by wire. It has wings.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
it’s permanently, positively buoyant.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And then by moving through the water

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it’s able to take that control.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
She just rolled right away from underneath.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It took 10 years to build.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I just had to go and build another machine.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and coming up slowly without thinking about it,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it’s a little bit of back pressure,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I don’t really look that ugly,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now, there she goes, right overhead.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This is a wide-angle camera.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
oh, I don’t know, just so close."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I come back up, not for air.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Applause)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Trying to fly and keep up with that animal --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It was the fact she was going so slow.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I actually designed that to move faster through the water

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because I thought that was the thing

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that we needed to do: to move fast and get range.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
She wanted to dance.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So the sub that was outside last year -- this is the one.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
You see the larger wing area here.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we wanted to try and bring other people

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but we couldn't figure out how to do it.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So we opened the world’s first flight school.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The rational for the world’s first flight school

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
they used to leave us alone when we were diving

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
these goofy little spherical things,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but when we started flying around

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they would come up and say,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
"Do you have a license for that?"

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beard

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that would all sprout out, and I would say,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
"I don’t need no stinking license."

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Laughter)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
"I write these stinking license," which I do.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So Bob Gelfond's around here --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They’re one of the first subsea aviators.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So we’ve run two flight schools.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But the patent for underwater flight --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Karen and I, we were looking at it,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
some business partners wanted us to patent it --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
we weren’t sure about that.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It just seems wrong to try and patent --

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
-- the freedom for underwater flight.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So anybody who wants to copy us

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and come and join us, go for it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We developed some other technology

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to make an announcement here this morning:

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
we’re going to be building a beautiful, little,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
small version of this -- unmanned, super deep --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Applause)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Thank you.
