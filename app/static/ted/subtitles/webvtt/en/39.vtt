WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
where I get this thing to work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about doing anything about aging.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
namely, by actually doing something about it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to do that in two steps.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The first one I'm going to talk about is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who are already in middle-age when you start --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or indeed, to get sick in the first place.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is how to reach that intermediate step,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that point of maybe 30 years life extension.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I'm going to start with why we should.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, I want to ask a question.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That was easy. OK.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And here is that characteristic.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which is something that was banned after a long struggle,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
by the government not very many months ago.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a traditional part of the way of life,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because the majority of the British public,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
came to the conclusion that it was really something

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And I think that human aging shares

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
all of these characteristics in spades.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What part of this do people not understand?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's not just about life, of course --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter) --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it's about healthy life, you know --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
whether or not dying may be fun.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It's a global trance.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that people give for aging.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that these excuses are completely valueless.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There are some good points to be made here,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But these are completely crazy, when you actually

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
remember your sense of proportion.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You know, these are arguments; these are things that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
would be legitimate to be concerned about.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But the question is, are they so dangerous --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
these risks of doing something about aging --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
namely, leaving aging as it is?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Are these so bad that they outweigh

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
then just don't waste my time, is what I say.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
(Laughter)

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, there is one argument

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
People worry about overpopulation; they say,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and kids are really important to most people."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And that's true.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and give answers like this.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
or a high death rate.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And, I say that that's fine --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If we vacillate, hesitate,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and do not actually develop these therapies,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
who would have been young enough and healthy enough

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I consider that that is immoral.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Right. So the next thing is,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
now why should we get a little bit more active on this?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the fundamental answer is that

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
why aging is actually a good thing after all.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
this becomes part of the problem.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in order to get people's attention, and make people realize

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that they are in a trance in this regard.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
A very simple definition.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which is to say, metabolism.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
This is not a completely tautological statement;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
it's a reasonable statement.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and it also happens to us,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
has side effects.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And there are really two games in town,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
when pathology is becoming evident,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and stop the accumulation of side effects

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
from causing the pathology quite so soon.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
because the things that are causing the pathology

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
are becoming more abundant as time goes on.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
because, you know, prevention is better than cure.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
even cells we're not really too good on yet.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We've discovered things like, for example,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
RNA interference only a few years ago,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but it is not an approach whose time has come

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
when we're talking about intervention.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So then, what do we do about that?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
pretty ironclad, doesn't it?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But it isn't.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
into what I'm calling step two.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
What would that actually mean

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
for how long people of various ages today --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
would actually live?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but it's not simple.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
then they'll live 30 years longer."

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
That's the wrong answer.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
There are two sorts of technological progress really,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
for this purpose.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Now, they differ a great deal

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in terms of the predictability of time frames.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Fundamental breakthroughs:

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
very hard to predict how long it's going to take

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to make a fundamental breakthrough.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
in the progression of the technology of powered flight.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
We can think, really, that each one is sort of

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The incremental advances have added up to something

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
which is not incremental anymore.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
happening of course a bit later.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
you know, the same sort of time frame.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
isn't a step at all.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That in fact, the people who are young enough

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to benefit from these first therapies

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that give this moderate amount of life extension,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
will be at some sort of cusp.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The therapies will be improving faster than

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is a very important point for me to get across.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Because, you know, most people, when they hear

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that are so thoroughly eliminating aging

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I'm not saying that at all.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
will be enough.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I decided to give this a little name,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
which is "longevity escape velocity."

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
(Laughter)

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Well, it seems to get the point across.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
in terms of remaining life expectancy,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
as measured by their health,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and an average 80-year-old,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
because you're too close to death's door

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You won't be able to withstand them.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
(Laughter) --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
eventually get through this

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
then you're never really even going

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
we don't know how old that person is today,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
because we don't know how long it's going to take

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to get these first-generation therapies.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
But irrespective of that age,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And that's quite a thought.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that will allow us to get to escape velocity?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And this is what it is.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
which basically means mice that live about three years on average.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and with those therapies, we get them to live,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
on average, to their fifth birthday.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, in other words, we add two years --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
we treble their remaining lifespan,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
starting from the point that we started the therapies.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Which we can now, as I've explained,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
starting from the time we get the mice?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
to actually how much people want it?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And it seems to me that the first question

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
is entirely a biology question,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and it's extremely hard to answer.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
One has to be very speculative,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I say that's nonsense.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
in order to give people a sense of proportion

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
so that they can assess their priorities.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
of reaching this RHR milestone,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
15 years from the robust mouse.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So they'll probably think it's five years away.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
That will be history at this point,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and of course that has enormous implications.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm going to use this word "damage"

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and that eventually cause pathology.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Because the critical thing about this

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But it is not part of metabolism itself.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And this turns out to be useful.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
at which metabolism lays down this damage.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in concrete biological terms in a moment.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
by stopping the damage converting into pathology.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And the reason it's a losing battle

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We can call it the "engineering approach,"

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It does not intervene in this process or this one.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
The engineering approach simply says,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We know that this threshold exists,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is important for aging in one way or another.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
The list on the right is also incomplete.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and it's just an incomplete list.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
or that might cause pathology.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And there are only seven of them.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Of course one can make a biological argument.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What can damage accumulate in?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
The answer is: long-lived molecules,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It's got to be long-lived molecules.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and that is pretty good news, because it means that,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
so the fact that we haven't extended this list

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
but we do need to get serious about it.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
We do need to really start trying.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I've published a great deal on this;

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and there's quite a lot of detail there.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
The detail is what makes me confident

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
So if you think that I'm wrong,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
who call themselves gerontologists because,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and not really to take it seriously.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
in order to understand whether this is true.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And we'll just end with a few things.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And you know what happened.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So, you know, this does happen.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
which is basically an incentive to innovate,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and to do what you think is going to work,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and you get money for it if you win.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
This is what's going to take a bit of money.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Not very long. OK.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
(Laughter)

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Thank you.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
(Applause)

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
but I thought I would give people the chance.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
(Laughter)

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
(Laughter)

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
(Applause)

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
which I happen to agree with,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
in order to age more slowly,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
living a long time or by procreation,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
there's a certain amount of modulation of that,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
which is why different species have different lifespans,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
but that's why there are no immortal species.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
CA: The genes don't care but we do?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
AG: That's right.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
If I project that, that would make me think

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
(Laughter)

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Your numbers are a bit out.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
The standard numbers are that lifespans

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
have been growing at between one and two years per decade.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
are actually in the human embryo,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
If that is indeed true,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
AG: There are technical implications certainly.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Basically what we need to do is replace cells

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
was a little bit of an oversimplification.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
but they do it by not having a nervous system --

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
on very long-lived cells.
