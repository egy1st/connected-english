00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We stood on the railroad tracks

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that ran between my friend's house and the beach.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but at that point the water had receded

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to a level three or four feet below normal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd never seen the reef here before.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They were trying to catch fish.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No one realized that this was a very bad idea.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The people on the tracks just continued to watch them.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I turned around to check on my friend's house.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then someone on the tracks screamed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The children managed to run back onto the tracks.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It continued to rise.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and that he would rather die there than run.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to get his dog, who was apparently afraid.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The slum built on the railroad reservation

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and no one was there when the water rose.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
all of this was from the houses in the slum.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This may seem hard to believe --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
One of the scariest things about the tsunami

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to catch a boat to the hospital.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We don't think another wave is coming right away.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
At the Phi Phi Hill Resort,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but I strained to listen for information.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
which triggered the massive tsunami.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Having this news was comforting in some small way

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to understand what had just happened to us.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
However, the report focused on what had already occurred

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and offered no information on what to expect now.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
knew anything with any certainty.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that essentially sprang up after it occurred.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that also were shown on blogs.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I should warn you, they're pretty powerful.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
(Screaming)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Voice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Voice 2: It's coming again?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Voice 2: Come get inside here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Voice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Voice 1: It's coming again. New wave!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
[Unclear]

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Screaming)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They called me out here.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
James Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
although initially -- that is, in that first day --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and some people complained about this.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
They said, "The blogsters let us down."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What became very clear was that,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
in a way that we never had been able to get before.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the sublime in the traditional sense of the word,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Because when we think about blogs,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I think for most of us who are concerned about them,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I want to ask three questions in this talk,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
about what motivates people to do things?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
of accessing a kind of collective intelligence

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then the third part is, What are the potential problems,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
or the dark side of blogs as we know them?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
OK, the first question:

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What do they tell us about why people do things?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and, of course, the Internet more generally --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and it's going to seem like a very obvious point,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but I think it is an important one to think about --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
are doing so primarily for free.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And this is -- at least, to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
because the traditional account of economic man would say that,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But instead, what we're finding on the Internet --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to work together without any money involved at all.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called "Coase's Penguin,"

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
who are producing enormous amounts of material

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
for no reason other than to tell their stories.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
for organizing a whole host of activities down the road.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
or, you have to pay for it to be good,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
without any money at all changing hands.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
or they love the attention, or whatever it is.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and, I think, is writing about this more,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but this notion of voluntary cooperation

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in terms of accessing collective intelligence?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And they can actually often be smarter

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
than even the smartest person within them.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
If I had a jar of jellybeans

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
your average guess would be remarkably good.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of the number of beans in the jar,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but for the most part the group's guess

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
would be better than just about all of you.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
in many more complicated situations.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
is forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
You know, if you think about something like Google,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
or a remarkable intelligence in it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Dan Gillmor -- whose book "We the Media"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is included in the gift pack --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
has talked about it as saying that, as a writer,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
he's recognized that his readers know more than he does.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that he or she knows better than everyone else.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and that we know is available to us

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Each blog post, each blog commentary

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
may not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
more often than not is going to give you a very interesting

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and enormously valuable picture of what's going on.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, that's the positive side of it.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
That's the positive side of what is sometimes called

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
participatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that, in fact, we are giving people

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
who have never been able to talk before a voice,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and we're able to access information that has always been there

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but has essentially gone untapped.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But there is a dark side to this,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
bottom-up structure of the Internet.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that being linked from one place to another,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And much of the time it is.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
once you are linked in the network,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
the network starts to shape your views

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
A network is not just the product of its component parts.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
It is something more than that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Now, this has all these benefits:

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
it gives you access to a whole host of people;

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But the problem is that groups are only smart

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
when the people in them are as independent as possible.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
or the paradox of collective intelligence,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And networks make it harder for people to do that,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
because they drive attention to the things that the network values.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
is that once a meme, once an idea gets going,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
because other people have, say, a link.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And that phenomenon

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
of piling on the existing links

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
particularly of the political blogosphere,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and it is one that essentially throws off

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
A lot of people talk about ants.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
no individual ant knows what it's doing,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.674
but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.

00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:13.849
They're able to reach food
as efficiently as possible,

00:15:13.874 --> 00:15:17.900
they're able to guide their traffic
with remarkable speed.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, the ant colony is a great model:

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But we know that occasionally ants go astray,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
they start to follow a simple rule --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
just do what the ant in front of you does.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
in a circle until they died.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
That's the thing we have to fear --

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
because one of the great things about the tsunami --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
in terms of the blogosphere's coverage,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
not in terms of the tsunami itself --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You saw people being able to offer up
their independent points of view

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
in a way that they hadn't before.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.182
Thank you very much. (Applause)
