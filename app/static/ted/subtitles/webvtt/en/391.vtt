00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Music)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Applause)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Thank you for being here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I said, "Thank you for being here."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
"Hallelujah, Johnny’s talking!"

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and your mother was out in the audience, say.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My dad said to me, "That’s one" --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I’ll explain that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so I turned around and I looked and I said,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
"God, who's saying what I’m thinking?"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, I want to take you on this journey.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Even though this one is kind of unusual,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I want you to think about your own journey.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
My journey began in 1971

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It disturbed me so much

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That’s a big thing in California.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in Inverness, California, because there were only

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And so when I came in and I started walking around, people --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
they just knew what was going on.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And people would drive up next to me

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and say, "John, what are you doing?"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment."

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And they said, "No, you’re walking to make us look bad, right?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You’re walking to make us feel bad."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And maybe there was some truth to that,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I called my parents up.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I said, "I’ve given up riding and driving in cars."

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?"

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I didn’t know about the environment then.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
They’re back in Philadelphia.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And so I told my mother, "I’m happy though, I’m really happy."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Mothers are like that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And so I did.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and so I stopped listening.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and thought of what I was going to say back,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
while they were still finishing up.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And then I would launch in.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Well, that just ended communication.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So on this first day I actually listened.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And it was very sad for me,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I was 27. I thought I knew everything.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I didn’t.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And so I decided I’d better do this for another day,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and another day, and another day until finally,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So for a year I said I would keep quiet,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and maybe I would talk again.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Well, that lasted 17 years.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I tried to study the environment by reading books.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I walked up to Ashland, Oregon,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
where they were offering an environmental studies degree.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It’s only 500 miles.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And I went into the Registrar’s office and --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
"What, what, what?"

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I had a newspaper clipping.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You don’t …?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We have a special program for you." They did.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor’s degree.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And my father came out, he was so proud.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
He said, "Listen, we’re really proud of you son,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You don’t ride in cars, you don’t talk --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you’re going to have to do those things."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Laughter)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and I started walking.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
rode it across Puget Sound

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and said I'd like to go to school there.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I said I'd be there in about two years.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Laughter)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And I was there. I showed up in two years and they --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I tell this story because they really helped me.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There are two stories in Montana.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The first story is I didn’t have any money -- that’s a sign I used a lot.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And they said,"Don't worry about that."

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
He gave me 150 dollars,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and he said, "Register for one credit.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And I said --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So I did that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He came back; he said to me,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you’re matriculating, so you can use the library.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And what we’re going to do

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
They’re going to save your grade,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Wow, they don’t do that in graduate schools, I don’t think.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They saw that I was really interested in the environment,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and they really wanted to help me along the way.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I didn’t talk and this was the last time

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
All the students sat around and they went ...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I could see they were looking for the schedule,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to see when they could get out.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
They had to take that class with me.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ...

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that’s -- he's using a handsaw."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
"Well, you can’t clearcut with a ..."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
"No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and they said things that I absolutely did not mean,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but I should have.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
you probably weren’t teaching very well.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And so I went on.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
My dad came out to see me graduate

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and, you know, I did the deal,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... "

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You know what went on,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?"

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I spent two years there writing on oil spills.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
No one was interested in oil spills.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But something happened --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Exxon Valdez.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
My dad came out again.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
He said, "I don't know how you do this, son --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
because you seem to be doing a lot better

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
when you’re not saying anything."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
(Laughter)

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, I put on my backpack again.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And on Earth Day, 1990 --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And that’s why I said, "Thank you for being here."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
because they had come to hear me speak.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that’s communication.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it’s one of those things that came out of the silence,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the listening to each other.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Really, very important --

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we need to listen to each other.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Well, my journey kept going on.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
My dad said, "That’s one,"

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I still didn’t let that go.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I wrote regulations for the United States --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
20 years ago, if someone had said to me,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
"John, do you really want to make a difference?"

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
"Yeah, I want to make a difference."

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
He said, "You just start walking east;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
get out of your car and just start walking east."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Laughter)

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
"You’re going to make a difference, buddy."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
How could that be, how could that be?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
make a difference?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And after that -- I only worked one year --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And you know, I forgot the most important thing,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I started talking because I had studied environment.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I’d studied environment at this formal level,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but there was this informal level.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And the informal level --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I learned about people, and what we do and how we are.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Because if we are the environment,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
then all we need to do is look around us

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And so that’s the message that I had.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
got to Venezuela and I started walking.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
This is the last part of this story, because it’s how I got here,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
or infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don’t know what possessed me,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because this was not like me.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I don't need to show you my passport. It’s in the back of my pack.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And I started walking off.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
What possessed me to say this thing?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
The road turned into the jungle.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I didn’t get shot.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I got to -- I start saying, "Free at last --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
thank God Almighty, I’m free at last."

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
"What was that about," I’m saying. What was that about?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
It took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I had become a prisoner.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
or use motorized vehicles.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Now how could that be?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
not to use motorized vehicles.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
But the thing that was different

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and that I was going to have to change.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You know, we can do it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I was going to have to change.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And I was afraid to change,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
because I was so used to the guy who only just walked.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But I know I needed to.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
that I could be here today.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And I know that a lot of times

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but there’s another place for us to go.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and go to the place of who we are becoming.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000
as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
We have to change now.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
As our former Vice President said,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
we have to become activists.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So if my voice can touch you,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
please let it be.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I know that all of you have touched me

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
while I’ve been here.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So, let’s go out into the world

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and take this caring, this love, this respect

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that we’ve shown each other right here at TED,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
and take this out into the world.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Because we are the environment,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and how we treat each other

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
is really how we’re going to treat the environment.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So I want to thank you for being here

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and I want to end this in five seconds of silence.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Thank you.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:07.000
(Applause)
