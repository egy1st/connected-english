00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a guy named Bob McKim.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and also led the Stanford Design Program.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who’s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And he liked to do an exercise with his students

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where he got them to take a piece of paper

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
very quickly, just as quickly as they could.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I need you to turn that piece of paper over;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you should find that it’s blank on the other side.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And there should be a pencil.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Come on: those masterpieces ...

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
OK? Stop. All right, now.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes, lot’s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Am I hearing a few "sorry’s"? I think I’m hearing a few sorry’s.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yup, yup, I think I probably am.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And that’s exactly what happens every time,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
every time you do this with adults.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
McKim found this every time he did it with his students.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry’s.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And he would point this out as evidence

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that we fear the judgment of our peers,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to people we think of as our peers, to those around us.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And this fear is what causes us

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to be conservative in our thinking.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So we might have a wild idea,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
they have no embarrassment at all.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
They just quite happily show their masterpiece

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to whoever wants to look at it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But as they learn to become adults,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And in studies of kids playing, it’s been shown

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
time after time that kids who feel secure,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
who are in a kind of trusted environment --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
they’re the ones that feel most free to play.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And if you’re starting a design firm, let’s say,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
then you probably also want to create

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
a place where people have the same kind of security.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Where they have the same kind of security to take risks.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Maybe have the same kind of security to play.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Before founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He knew that friendship is a short cut to play.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that we need to take as designers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And so, that decision to work with his friends --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
are designed to help people feel relaxed:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
familiar with their surroundings,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
comfortable with the people that they’re working with.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that remind people to be playful,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and that it’s a permissive environment.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So, whether it’s this microbus meeting room

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that we have in one our buildings at IDEO;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
or at the Googleplex, where

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but anyway, they’re there in the garden.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Or even in the Swiss office of Google,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So all of these places have these symbols.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
not so much the place, it’s a thing.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
or created a few years ago.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I forgot to bring one up with me.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you’ll find something taped underneath it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
has got one taped under your chair.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But before we start, I need just to put these on.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Thank you. All right.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I can’t see out of these, OK.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
can actually get those things onto the stage.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So the way they work is, you know,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you just put your finger in the thing,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
pull them back, and off you go.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So, don’t look backwards. That’s my only recommendation here.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Laughter)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There we go.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
(Laughter)

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well, they’re still coming in from the back there;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
they’re still coming in.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Can you not figure out how to do it, or something?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It’s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I'd better clear these up out of the way;

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
otherwise, I’m going to trip over them.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
All right. So the rest of you can save them

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
for when I say something particularly boring,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and then you can fire at me.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
All right. I think I’m going to take these off now,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So, ah, that was fun.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Laughter)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
All right, good.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Applause)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So, OK, so why?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Why do we have them? Well, as I said,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But why is it important?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Helps us do our jobs better,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and helps us feel better when we do them.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, an adult encountering a new situation --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Life’s complicated; we want to figure out

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
what’s going on around us very quickly.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to categorize new things very, very quickly.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
One of them might be, you know,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
when we see this funny stripy thing:

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We need to figure that out pretty fast.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Well, at least, we did once.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Well, not necessarily.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Of course they will. But they’ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And you know, the more creative of them

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
might get to a really interesting example.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We’ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
our kids end up playing with the boxes

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
far more than they play with the toys that are inside them.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And you know, from an exploration perspective,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
this behavior makes complete sense.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Even one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
which, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So again, this is another one of those playful activities

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
is called the "30 Circles Test."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So we’re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
back over, and you’ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to give you minute,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
into objects of some form.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So for example, you could turn one into a football,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
or another one into a sun. All I’m interested in is quantity.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I want you to do as many of them as you can,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in the minute that I’m just about to give you.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So, who got more than five circles figured out?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Keep your hands up if you did 10.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We stop ourselves from doing things.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We self-edit as we’re having ideas.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
even if they don’t seem that different from each other,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So now, Bob McKim did another

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
version of this test

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Anybody know what this is? It’s the peyote cactus.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It’s the plant from which you can create mescaline,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
one of the psychedelic drugs.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that he and his colleagues conducted

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So he picked 27 professionals -- they were

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
furniture designers even, artists --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and he asked them to come along one evening,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
He gave each of them some mescaline,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And then he did what’s called the Purdue Creativity Test.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and after the drugs, to see

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
what the difference was in people’s

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
facility and speed with coming up with ideas.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And then he asked them to go away

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and work on those problems that they’d brought.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And they’d come up with a bunch of

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
interesting solutions -- and actually, quite

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so, some of the things that they figured out,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
some of these individuals figured out;

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that were accepted by clients;

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
a design of a solar space probe experiment;

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
you can tell this is a while ago;

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the completion of a line of furniture;

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and even a new conceptual model of the photon.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So it was a pretty successful evening.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
got off to its great start with innovation.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We don’t know, but it may be.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We need to ask some of the CEOs

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important;

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it was this idea that what the drugs did

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and getting them to forget the adult behaviors

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that were getting in the way of their ideas.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Edicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And somehow that seems wrong.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I mean, can you have rules about creativity?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to help us break the old rules and norms

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that otherwise we might bring to the creative process.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And we’ve certainly learnt that over time,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
you get much better brainstorming,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
achieve this is in a much more organic way.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And they experimented with plywood for many years

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
without necessarily having one single goal in mind.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
They were exploring following what was interesting to them.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and from this experiment they moved on to chairs.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Through constant experimentation with materials,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
they developed a wide range of iconic solutions

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that we know today, eventually resulting in,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of course, the legendary lounge chair.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
then we wouldn’t be the beneficiaries of so many

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
wonderful designs today.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
from films to buildings, from games to graphics.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So, they’re great examples, I think, of exploration

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and experimentation in design.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
they were also exploring physical objects.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And they were doing that through building prototypes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So the average Western first-grader

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
spends as much as 50 percent of their play time

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
taking part in what’s called "construction play."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
but also a powerful way to learn.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
When play is about building a tower out of blocks,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the kid begins to learn a lot about towers.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It’s classically learning by doing.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Now, David Kelley calls this behavior,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
when it’s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands."

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And it typically involves making multiple,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
low-resolution prototypes very quickly,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
often by bringing lots of found elements together

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in order to get to a solution.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
So, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Another example is a group of designers

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
about what it was they needed with this device.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And one of the designers ran out of the room

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and a clothespin. He taped them all together,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
ran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?"

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
well, I want to hold it like this, or like that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And all of a sudden a productive conversation

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
was happening about design around a tangible object.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And in the end it turned into a real device.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
sometimes about the environment.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But the important idea is that everything’s at hand, everything’s around.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So when designers are working on ideas,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
they can start building stuff whenever they want.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
They don’t necessarily even have to go

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
into some kind of formal workshop to do it.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And we think that’s pretty important.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And then the sad thing is, although preschools

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
are full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
it all gets taken away.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They lose this stuff that facilitates

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
this sort of playful and building mode of thinking.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
maybe the best construction tool we have

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
might be the Post-it notes. It’s pretty barren.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
But by giving project teams and the clients

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
who they’re working with permission to think with their hands,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
quite complex ideas can spring into life

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and go right through to execution much more easily.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
explaining what she wants out of a portable information system

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
to a team of technologists and designers

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that are working with her in a hospital.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And just having this very simple prototype

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And of course, by building quick prototypes,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
we can get out and test our ideas with consumers

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and users much more quickly

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
than if we’re trying to describe them through words.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
But what about designing something that isn’t physical?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Something like a service or an experience?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Something that exists as a series of interactions over time?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
So, if you’re designing an interaction between two people --

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
such as, I don’t know -- ordering food at a fast food joint

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
or something, you need to be able to imagine

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
how that experience might feel over a period of time.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And I think the best way to achieve that,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
trying to convince our clients of this.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
They can be a little skeptical; I’ll come back to that.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems --

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
things like education or security or finance or health.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And this is another example in a healthcare environment

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
of some doctors and some nurses and designers

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
acting out a service scenario around patient care.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
But you know, many adults

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Some of it’s embarrassment and some of it is because

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
they just don’t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
you know, "That’s just happening because they’re acting it out."

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Research into kids' behavior actually suggests

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Because when children play a role,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
they actually follow social scripts quite closely

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
that they’ve learnt from us as adults.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house,"

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
then the whole kind of play falls down.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So they get used to quite quickly

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
to understanding the rules for social interactions,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So when, as adults, we role-play,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
We’ve gone through lots of experiences in life,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
and they provide a strong intuition

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
as to whether an interaction is going to work.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
So we’re very good, when acting out a solution,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
at spotting whether something lacks authenticity.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
So role-play is actually, I think,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
is to put ourselves through an experience which we’re designing for,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
and project ourselves into an experience.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
So here are some designers who are trying to understand

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
what it might feel like to sleep in a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
confined space on an airplane.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
One of the reasons he chose to take

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
this rather large video camera with him was

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
he was actually sick, and sticking something into him

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
that he was going to regret later.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Because when we looked at the video when he got back,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
we saw 20 minutes of this.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
(Laughter)

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And also, the amazing thing about this video --

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
as soon as you see it you immediately

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
project yourself into that experience.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
while you’re left out in the hallway

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And so this notion of using role-play --

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
or in this case, living through the experience

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
as a way of creating empathy --

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
particularly when you use video, is really powerful.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Or another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
he’s here having his chest waxed, not because he’s very vain,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
although actually he is -- no, I’m kidding --

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
go through when they’re having dressings removed.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And so sometimes these analogous experiences,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
analogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
he’s beginning to try on that identity.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
We’re doing the same thing as designers.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
We’re trying on these experiences.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
as well as a tool for prototyping experiences.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
but also because of their willingness to explore

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
and their ability to unselfconsciously

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
surrender themselves to the experience.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
In short, we admire their willingness to play.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Playful exploration, playful building and role-play:

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And so far, I admit, this might feel

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
they’re following a script that they’ve agreed to.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
So, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
The kind of little face, the portrait you did?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
while you were drinking in a pub.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
But everybody agreed to play a game

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
difficult situation into a fun game.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
As a result, we’d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time --

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
But there aren’t just rules about how to play;

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
there are rules about when to play.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Kids don’t play all the time, obviously.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
They transition in and out of it,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
and good teachers spend a lot of time

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
thinking about how to move kids through these experiences.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And if we’re running design studios

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
designers through these different experiences?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of --

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I think what’s very different about design

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
We go through a sort of generative mode,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
where we’re exploring many ideas;

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
and then we come back together again,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and come back looking for that solution,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
and developing that solution.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I think they’re two quite different modes:

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
divergence and convergence.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
that we most need playfulness.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And so being able to move between those modes

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Because it’s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
You’re either playful or you’re serious, and you can’t be both.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
But that’s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and, at times, be playful.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
It’s not an either/or; it’s an "and."

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
You can be serious and play.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
So to sum it up, we need trust to play,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
and we need trust to be creative. So, there’s a connection.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And there are a series of behaviors that we’ve learnt as kids,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
They include exploration, which is about going for quantity;

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
building, and thinking with your hands;

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
and role-play, where acting it out helps us both

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
and to create services and experiences

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
that are seamless and authentic.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
