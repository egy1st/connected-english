00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It’s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which you can find in any store in the nation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I'm most grateful to them for this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So what you’re smelling now is the top note.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will show it to you.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any Melaleuca bark,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because it’s totally forbidden.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And after that, the complete fragrance.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now what you are smelling is a combination of --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it’s about 400.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So what you’re smelling is several hundred molecules

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
floating through the air, hitting your nose.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It’s not really true.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And perfumery shows you that can’t be true,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because if it were like that it wouldn’t be an art, OK?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Everything that you’re smelling in here

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is made up of atoms that come from what I call

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the Upper East Side of the periodic table -- a nice, safe neighborhood.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You really don’t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Some people have tried in the 1920s

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to add things from the bad parts, and it didn’t really work.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
These are the five atoms from which just about everything

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and this would be called a green note,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because it smells of something green, like cut grass.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But the first theory is: it must be the shape.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
almost everything else in biology works by shape.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I will try and explain to you what’s wrong with this notion.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, this is a totally insane idea.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I’m working on it.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here’s how shape works in normal receptors.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
by binding in certain parts.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Now, what’s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This is one page of work from a chemist’s workbook, OK?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Working for a fragrance company.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He’s making 45 molecules, and he’s looking for a sandalwood,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
something that smells of sandalwood.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Because there’s a lot of money in sandalwoods.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.


00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So this is a profoundly inefficient process.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And my definition of a theory is, it’s not just something

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that you teach people; it’s labor saving.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
A theory is something that enables you to do less work.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Conversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It’s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.


00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Now, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
for biology, and he says, "That’s easy! The things are a different color!"

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
some sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
S-H, quite a different frequency.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
If you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that has been, so to speak, damaged,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
You have a unique smell, a unique vibration.


00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So I went searching when I started in this game

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to this whole crazy story.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Now, after searching high and low for several months,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
which has exactly the same vibration.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,


00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
my wife is German and she translated it for me --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"


00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
an "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Now, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And this is the main objection to the theory.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
OK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
(Laughter)

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
This is a joke. I’m a biologist, OK?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So it’s a joke against myself.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
on fundamental research, discovered a way

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but I’ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here’s how it works.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can’t jump.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So here you have a system, you have something --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
does the reaction happen, OK?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
In other words, I’ve taken off-the-shelf components,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and I’ve made a spectroscope.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
What’s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
is that then it tells you that the nose,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Of course, it doesn’t matter, because it could also be that they’re not.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
But it has a certain --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Laughter)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
-- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
who read too much 19th-century German literature.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And then a magnificent thing happened:

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I left academia and joined the real world of business,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and a company was created around my ideas

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to make new molecules using my method,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
along the lines of, let’s put someone else’s money where your mouth is.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And one of the first things that happened was

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we started going around to fragrance companies

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
asking for what they needed, because, of course,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
if you could calculate smell, you don’t need chemists.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
OK? So you can try a thousand molecules,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And so that’s a direct path to making new odorants.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And one of the first things that happened was

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
we went to see some perfumers in France --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and here’s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
It’s the molecule that has made men’s fragrances

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And the problem is it’s a carcinogen.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Laughter)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
There are some reckless people, but it’s not worth it, OK?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
of coumarin, and you smooth it out,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
related or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And we actually, in this case, I’m sorry to say,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
it happened -- it was serendipitous.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and he said, look, I’ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that even if this compound doesn’t smell of coumarin,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I want to do it, it’s just such a nifty,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
one step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
crystalline compound. Let us try it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Calculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the white one is the old one.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And this is our new baby, called tonkene.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You see, when you’re a scientist, you’re always selling ideas.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Why should new ideas be accepted?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and it smells like coumarin, and it isn’t coumarin,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and you’ve found it in three weeks,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
this focuses everybody’s mind wonderfully.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
(Laughter)

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
(Applause)

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And people often ask me, is your theory accepted?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there’s three attitudes:

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You’re right, and I don’t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
You’re right, and I don’t care how you do it, in a sense;

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
you bring me the molecules, you know.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And: You’re completely wrong, and I’m sure you’re completely wrong.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
OK? Now, we’re dealing with people who only want results,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and this is the commercial world.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they’re happy.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But we’re not actually doing it by astrology.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But for the last three years, I’ve had what I consider to be

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
at the service of something that actually works.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
(Applause)
