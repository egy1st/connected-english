WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, about three years ago I was in London,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I represent a group of people,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We want to be in the forefront fields,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we want to do it differently.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We want to get out of this thing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and decide what science gets done.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(Laughter)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is take you on a quick tour of some of the things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that we talk about and we think about.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, we think a lot about what really makes science work?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The first thing that anybody who knows science,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and has been around science,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is wrong. There is no method.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as a community, from incomplete evidence

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to conclusions that we all agree about.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So how does it work?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, my belief is that it works

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And here are some of the ethical principles.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I’m in entertain, amaze mode.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
(Laughter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But one of the principles is that everybody

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
who is part of the community gets to fight and argue

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as hard as they can for what they believe.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that the only people who are going to decide, you know,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
whether I’m right or somebody else is right,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
are the people in our community in the next generation,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in 30 and 50 years.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So it’s this combination of respect

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
for the tradition and community we’re in,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that makes science work.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And being in this process of being in a community

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I believe, teaches us about democracy.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but there has been, historically, a relationship

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and how people think about the society that they live in.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
goes to its natural place, which was of course,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
embraced Aristotle and blessed it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And the idea is that everything is defined.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
perfect realm, where lives God,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
who is the ultimate judge of everything.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and in a certain sense, medieval society.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
space and time and motion and so forth of Newton.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
of John Locke and his collaborators.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And they were very closely associated.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and a society on the other hand, were closely related.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And let me show you.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There are particles and they move around

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but with respect to this absolute notion of space,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
which for Newton was God.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and those are defined with respect to some absolute,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
which are independent of what else has happened in the society.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There is also an omniscient observer

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
who knows everything, who is God,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
who is in a certain sense outside the universe,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because he has no role in anything that happens,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but is in a certain sense everywhere,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because space is just the way that God knows

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
where everything is, according to Newton, OK?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
liberal political theory and Newtonian physics.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and which is still going on.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It was begun with the invention

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
of relativity theory and quantum theory.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
something that’s going on right now.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This universe is described by being a network of relationships.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
absolutely where something is.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So we call it a relational universe.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
your view of the world has to do with what information

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
comes to you through the network of relations.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And there’s no place for an omniscient observer

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is also, if you talk to legal scholars,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They’re thinking about the same things.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And not only that, they make the analogy

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to relativity theory and cosmology often.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
which means that there’s no place

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to put an explanation for something outside.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So in such a relational universe,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
like this device here, or that device there,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
or something beautiful, like all the living things,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
all of you guys in the room --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Laughter)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Then you want to know, you’re a person,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you want to know how is it made.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
There must be mechanisms of self-organization

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
inside the universe that make things.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So it works. But not only that,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
if you think about how natural selection works,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
then it turns out that natural selection

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
would only make sense in such a relational universe.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That is, natural selection works on properties,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
like fitness, which are about relationships

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
of some species to some other species.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So a theory of biology based on natural selection

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
requires a relational notion of

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
what are the properties of biological systems.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And if you push that all the way down, really,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
it makes the best sense in a relational universe

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
where all properties are relational.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that gravity is the result of the world being relational.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
In the 20th century,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
In the biological sciences, they explored

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the implications of the notion that order and complexity

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and structure arise in a self-organized way.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the human sciences, economics, et cetera.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
At the same time, we physicists

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
have been busy trying to make sense of

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and build on and integrate the discoveries

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
of quantum theory and relativity.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
21st-century science is going to be driven

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
by the integration of these two ideas:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the triumph of relational ways of thinking

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
about the world, on the one hand,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
on the other hand.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And also, is that in the 21st century

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
our thinking about space and time and cosmology,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And what they’re evolving towards is the union

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that there are many different interests, many different agendas,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
many different individuals, many different points of view.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
in a network of relationships.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Any actor in a democracy is embedded

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in a network of relationships.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And you understand some things better than other things,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and because of that there’s a continual jostling

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and give and take, which is politics.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And politics is, in the ideal sense,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
the way in which we continually address

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
our network of relations in order to achieve

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
a better life and a better society.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And I also think that science will never go away and --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I’m finishing on this line.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
(Laughter)

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.
