00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I spent the better part of a decade

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that to me sums up what there is to know

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And that moment came on April 21, 1994.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On April 21, in the New York Times,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
had already been killed in the genocide.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was in the paper -- not on the front page.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it was buried in the paper.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And that was that an American congresswoman

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
met with a group of journalists.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And one of the journalists said to her, what's up?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What's going on in the U.S. government?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's two weeks into the genocide at that time,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Why no hearings, no denunciations,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or in front of the White House? What's the deal?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and my office in Washington,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but nobody is calling about the people.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The phones just aren't ringing about the people."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, 


00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we didn't have an endangered people's movement.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We had Holocaust education in the schools.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
appropriately, interestingly.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And yet the politicization of Never Again,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the operationalization of Never Again,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
had never occurred in the 20th century.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we have to make it such.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
There has to be a role --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that was the 20th century.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
on college campuses around the country.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There are something like 500 high school chapters

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's got all the ups and the downs of movements.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in that it has become,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
it has congealed into this endangered people's movement

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that was missing in the 20th century.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It sees itself, such as it is, the it,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
there will be a political price to be paid,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now because it's student-driven,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
there's some amazing things that the movement has done.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They have launched a divestment campaign

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to divest their holdings of stocks

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
this is going to sound very kitsch,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
but interested in doing something about genocide,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
are genocide grades.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So what you now have when a Congress is in session

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And the students and the others

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
who are part of this incredibly energized base

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
from the United States,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a whole series of commitments to Darfur

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that no other country in the world is making.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to the International Criminal Court,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
which the Bush administration doesn't like.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to keep those people alive

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
until something more durable can be achieved.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And recently, or now not that recently,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
of 26,000 that will go.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And that's all the Bush administration's leadership,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
from the beginning of this crisis.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is that evil lives on.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
by so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
with spears and Kalashnikovs.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
are themselves subjected to rape,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which is a tool of the genocide that is being used.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
as we sit here, as we speak.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Why the limits to the movement?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but a couple just to focus on briefly.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The first is that the movement, such as it is,


00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
stops at America's borders. 
It is not a global movement. 


00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
want to bring Never Again to life.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
created a space in our society for a consensus

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that Rwanda was bad and wrong

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and we wish we had done more, and that is something

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that the movement has taken advantage of.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
European governments, for the most part,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to push back and up against.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So this movement, if it's to be durable and global,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
will have to cross borders, and you will have to see

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that their government would do something in the face of genocide,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but actually making it such.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
naturally or eagerly.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or reigning in loose nukes.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
towards distant suffering?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So one reason is it hasn't gone global.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we have a credibility problem,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
a legitimacy problem in international institutions.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It is structurally really, really hard to do,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
as the Bush administration rightly does,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
which is to denounce genocide on a Monday

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Let me be clear.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
The recovery's going to take some time.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that could come home to roost sometime in the future?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that many of you may not have ever heard of,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
even after the U.S. invasion, where,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Now, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And in the U.N., you don't get that many people

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
who actually manage to merge those qualities.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
He was successful with women.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
of troubleshooting in the world's worst places

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and in the world's most broken places.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
These are the places he was drawn to.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
He moved with the headlines.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
were wars of independence and decolonization.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He was there in Bangladesh

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the largest refugee flow in history up to that point.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States. 


00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
which Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
He negotiates with the Serbs.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
into neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
well, I don't want to feed the killers

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
we're going to set up camps,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and we're going to supply humanitarian aid.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Let me go door-to-door to the international community

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So then you have to make the decision.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Do you turn off the international spigot of life support

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and risk two million civilian lives?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
What do you do?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Late '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
than people who have never done that kind of work.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
again, the world's worst places.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
bowing out of international law? Do you denounce?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Well, if you denounce,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
you're probably never going to get back in the room.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the one that resulted in his death.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
One note on his death, which is so devastating,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is that despite predicating the war on Iraq

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and how to deal with brokenness,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
You're un-owned.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
was able to muster for his rescue,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
went into the shaft. Building was shaking.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But all they had was a woman's handbag --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
literally one of those basket handbags --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
in the interests of rescuing this person,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
The good news, for what it's worth,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
the military created a search and rescue unit

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
the things that you would have needed to do the rescue.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
But it was too late for Sergio.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I want to wrap up, but I want to close

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
which is how I would have framed the question.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I think that was his greatest quality.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
he would charge up to people who were violating international law,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the power of any military or police.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
he said to himself and to everybody else,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I will never use it. I will try to make it such,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
but I will never use that word again.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But he lunged in the opposite direction.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
to not denounce, and became almost obsequious

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
that we as a country can learn from.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And I think that's something that we have to be in the room,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
or Reagan and Gorbachev.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
has come by going into the room.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You can actually do far more to build an international coalition

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
that was really, really unusual.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
He saw them.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
At a macro level, he thought, you know,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
that's an affront to people's dignity.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We put people on humanitarian aid

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
It's incredibly important,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
hadn't spent that money in Darfur,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
but it's not a way to live.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
and as individuals with relation to the people around us,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
into our dealings with other countries,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
it would be something of a revolution.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
There are so many genuine threats in the world.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
But what Sergio was talking about is,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
let's calibrate our relationship to the threat.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
is, fear is a bad advisor.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
We lunge towards the extremes

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
when we aren't operating and trying to, again,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
calibrate our relationship to the world around us.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
had a humility, of course,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
How Sisyphean this task was of mending,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and yet aware of that complexity, 


00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
ah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
We can't afford to pull back from the world.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
It's a question of how to be in the world.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And the lesson, I think,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
that is a partial success but by no means

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
has it achieved what it has set out to do --

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens --

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
without us creating a space for that to happen,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
for having respect for dignity,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and for bringing that combination of humility

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
to our dealings with the rest of the world.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So will evil prevail? Is that the question?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Thank you.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
(Applause)
