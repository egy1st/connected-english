00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.269
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:03.483
I don't sleep that much,

00:00:03.507 --> 00:00:06.230
and I've come to this thing
about, like, not sleeping much

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:07.560
as being a great virtue,

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.241
after years of kind of battling it

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:11.271
as being a terrible
detriment or something.

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:14.236
And now I really like sort of sitting up.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.415
You know, but for years,
I've been sitting up,

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.736
and I think my creativity
is greatly motivated

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.411
by this kind of insomnia.

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:27.710
I lie awake. I think thoughts.
I walk aimlessly sometimes.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.567
I used to walk more at night.

00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:33.682
I walk during the day, and I follow
people who I think look interesting.

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:35.728
(Laughter)

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:40.398
And sometimes -- actually, once
it was on "Page Six" in the "Post"

00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:43.021
that I was cruising this guy,
like, sort of, whatever,

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:46.522
but I was actually just following
because he had these great shoes on --

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.550
(Laughter)

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:48.928
so I was following this guy.

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:50.591
And I took a picture of his shoes,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.013
and we thanked each other
and just went on our way.

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:54.329
But I do that all the time.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:57.436
As a matter of fact, I think
a lot of my design ideas

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.452
come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:05.372
Because I feel like, you know,
there are so many images out there,

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:07.586
so many clothes out there.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.262
And the only ones
that look interesting to me

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:13.976
are the ones that look
slightly mistaken, of course,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.850
or very, very surprising.

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:18.161
And often, I'm driving in a taxi,

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:21.896
and I see a hole in a shirt or something
that looks very interesting

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.419
or pretty or functional

00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:26.602
in some way that I'd never
seen happen before.

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:30.913
And so I'd make the car stop,
and I'd get out of the car and walk

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.259
and see that, in fact,
there wasn't a hole,

00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:36.038
but it was a trick of my eye;
it was a shadow, you know.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.468
Or if there was a hole,
I'd think like, "Oh, damn.

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:40.854
Actually, someone thought
of that thought already.

00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.809
Someone made that mistake already,
so I can't do it anymore."

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.703
I don't know where inspiration comes from.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:50.976
It does not come, for me, from research.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.413
I don't get necessarily
inspired by research.

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:54.588
As a matter of fact,

00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:57.505
one of the most fun things
I've ever done in my whole life

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:00.453
was this Christmas season
at the Guggenheim in New York.

00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:04.397
I read "Peter and the Wolf"
with this beautiful band from Juilliard,

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.045
and I did, like, you know,
the narrator, and I read it.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.450
And I saw this really
smart critic who I love,

00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:11.772
this woman Joan Acocella,
who's a friend of mine.

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.332
And she came backstage and said,

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:16.625
"Oh, Isaac, did you know that --
talk to me about Stalinism

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.388
and talk to me about, you know,
like, the '30s in Russia."

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.943
And I thought, "How do I know
about Stalinism?"

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.990
I know about a wolf and a bird,

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:25.616
and, you know, he ate the bird,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.073
and then in the end, you know,
you hear the bird squeaking or something.

00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:30.108
(Laughter)

00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:32.336
So I don't really know that,
I don't really --

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.832
actually, I do my own kind
of research, you know?

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:38.337
If I'm commissioned to do the costumes
for an 18th-century opera

00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:39.763
or something like that,

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:42.395
I will do a lot of research,
because it's interesting,

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.236
not because it's what I'm supposed to do.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.976
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.976
The color of movies
and the way light makes the colors.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.284
Light from behind the projection
or light from the projection

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.976
makes the colors look so impossible.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.885
Anyway, roll this little clip.
I'll just show you.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.384
I sit up at night, and I watch movies,

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.678
and I watch women in movies a lot.

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:10.816
And I think about, you know, their roles

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.161
and about how you have to, like,
watch what your daughters look at.

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:18.574
Because I look at the way women
are portrayed all the time,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.666
whether they're kind of
glorified in this way,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.337
or whether they're kind of,
you know, ironically glorified,

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:32.817
or whether they're sort of denigrated
or ironically denigrated.

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:34.769
I go back to color all the time.

00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:39.606
Color is something
that motivates me a lot.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:44.640
It's rarely color that I find in nature,

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:49.626
although, you know,
juxtaposed next to artificial color,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.388
natural color is so beautiful.

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:55.117
So that's what I do. I study color a lot.

00:03:55.141 --> 00:04:01.646
But for the most part, I think,
like, how can I ever make anything

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.976
that is as beautiful
as that image of Natalie Wood?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.095
How can I ever make anything
as beautiful as Greta Garbo?

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.869
I mean, that's just not
possible. You know?

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:16.412
And so that's what makes me
lie awake at night, I guess.

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:21.236
I'm also like a big --

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.344
I go to astrologers
and tarot card readers often,

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.666
and that's another thing
that motivates me a lot.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.976
People say, "Do that" -- an astrologer
tells me to do something,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.151
so I do it.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.177
(Laughter)

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:36.092
When I was about 21, an astrologer told me

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.271
that I was going to meet
the man of my dreams,

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:40.711
and that his name was going
to be Eric, right?

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:43.229
So, you know, for years I would go to bars

00:04:43.253 --> 00:04:45.488
and, sort of, anyone I met
whose name was Eric,

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.583
I was humping immediately or something.

00:04:47.607 --> 00:04:49.912
(Laughter)

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.902
There were times when I was so desperate,

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:54.029
I would just walk into a room
and go, "Eric?"

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.999
And anybody who would turn around,
I would make a beeline for.

00:04:57.023 --> 00:04:58.114
(Laughter)

00:04:58.138 --> 00:05:01.370
And I had this really interesting
tarot reading a long time ago.

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:04.543
The last card he pulled,
which was representing my destiny,

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:06.929
was this guy in, like,
a straw boater with a cane

00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:10.468
and, you know, sort of spats and this,
you know, a minstrel singer, right?

00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:11.884
I want to show you this clip,

00:05:11.908 --> 00:05:16.133
because I do this kind of crazy thing
where I do a cabaret act.

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:17.548
So actually, check this out.

00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:18.723
Very embarrassing.

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:20.165
(Video) (Applause)

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.439
Thank you. We'll do anything you ask.

00:05:24.463 --> 00:05:29.278
The name of the show is based
on this story that I have to tell you,

00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:30.464
about my mother.

00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:32.613
It's sort of an excerpt
from a quote of hers.

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:34.045
I was dating this guy, right?

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.485
And this has to do
with being happy, I swear.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.871
I was dating this guy,
and it was going on for about a year,

00:05:43.895 --> 00:05:45.238
and we were getting serious,

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.895
so we decided to invite them all
to dinner, our parents.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.538
We introduced them to each other.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:52.256
My mother was, sort of,
very sensitive to his mother,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.793
who, it seemed, was a little bit skeptical

00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:57.358
about the whole
"alternative lifestyle" thing --

00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:58.871
you know, homosexuality.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:01.871
So my mother was a little offended,
and turned to her and said,

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:04.486
"Are you kidding? They have
the greatest life together.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.771
They eat out, they see shows ..."

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:08.976
They eat out, they see shows.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.113
(Laughter)

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:12.566
That's the name of the show,
"They eat out, they --"

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.583
That's on my tombstone when I die:

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:17.243
"He ate out, he saw shows." Right?

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:19.267
(Laughter)

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.038
So in editing these clips,

00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:26.486
I didn't have the audacity
to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.494
So you'll have to go check it out
and come see me or something,

00:06:29.518 --> 00:06:30.669
because it's mortifying.

00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:34.289
And yet, it feels --

00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:35.826
I don't know how to put this.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.087
I feel as little comfort as possible
is a good thing. You know?

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.373
And at least, you know, in my case,

00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:48.770
because if I just do
one thing all the time,

00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:54.656
I don't know, I get very, very bored.
I bore very easily.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.418
And you know, I don't say
that I do everything well.

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:04.118
I just say that I do a lot
of things, that's all.

00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:08.293
And I kind of try
not to look back, you know?

00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:11.300
Except, I guess that's what staying up
every night is about --

00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:14.534
like, looking back and thinking,
"What a fool you made of yourself."

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:15.712
You know?

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.392
But I guess that's OK. Right?

00:07:17.848 --> 00:07:18.884
(Laughter)

00:07:18.908 --> 00:07:20.362
Because if you do many things,

00:07:20.386 --> 00:07:23.817
you get to feel lousy about everything,
and not just one, you know?

00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.976
You don't master feeling lousy
about one thing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.150
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.689
I will show you this next thing,

00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.261
speaking of costumes for operas.

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:36.229
I do work with different choreographers.

00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:38.156
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.992
and I work with Mark Morris a lot,

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:41.461
who is one of my best friends.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:44.976
And I designed three operas with him --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.704
the most recent one, "King Arthur."

00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:50.333
I've been very ingrained
in the dance world

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:51.508
since I was a teenager.

00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:53.437
I went to a performing arts high school,

00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:54.675
where I was an actor,

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.809
and many of my friends
were ballet dancers.

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.434
Again, I don't know
where inspiration comes from.

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.603
I don't know where it comes from.

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.066
I started making puppets when I was a kid.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.559
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration
thing started from: puppets.

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:09.691
(Laughter)

00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:11.501
And then performing arts high school.

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.787
There I was in high school,
meeting dancers and acting.

00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:19.213
And somehow, from there,
I got interested in design.

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.568
I went to Parsons School of Design,

00:08:21.592 --> 00:08:24.309
and then I began my career as a designer.

00:08:24.952 --> 00:08:27.059
I don't really think of myself
as a designer,

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.349
and I don't really think of myself
necessarily as a fashion designer.

00:08:30.373 --> 00:08:32.870
And frankly, I don't really know
what to call myself.

00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:35.298
I think of myself as ...

00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:37.762
I don't know what I think
of myself as, so ...

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:38.952
That's just that.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:41.670
(Laughter)

00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:45.308
But I must say, this whole thing
about being slightly bored all the time,

00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:49.026
I think that is a very important thing
for a fashion designer.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.012
You always have to be, like,
slightly bored with everything.

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:55.659
And if you're not, you have to pretend
to be slightly bored with everything.

00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:57.016
(Laughter)

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.411
But I am really a little bored
with everything.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:03.505
I always say to my partner,
Marisa Gardini, who books everything --

00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:05.613
books everything
and makes everything happen

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:06.884
and makes all the deals.

00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:10.580
And I always tell her
that I find myself with a lot of time

00:09:10.604 --> 00:09:12.654
on the computer bridge program.

00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:17.540
Too much time on computer bridge,
which is, you know, like, that's --

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:20.452
So, somehow, like, about 10 years ago,

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:24.115
I thought that the most
unboring place in the world

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:26.864
would be, like, a TV studio,
like for a day show,

00:09:26.888 --> 00:09:28.339
some kind of day talk show,

00:09:28.363 --> 00:09:31.955
because it's all of these
things that I love

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.191
kind of in one place.

00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:35.902
And if you ever get bored,
you can look at another thing

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:38.233
and do another thing
and talk about it, right?

00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:40.761
And so I had this TV show.

00:09:40.785 --> 00:09:43.786
And that was a very, very,
very big part of my process.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.811
Actually, could you roll the clip, please?

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.264
This is one of my favorite
clips of Rosie O'Donnell.

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.836
(Video) Isaac Mizrahi:
We're back on the set. Hi, Ben!

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.198
Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.

00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:54.616
IM: Look how cute she looks
with just a slick back.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.455
Ben: As my grandmother says, "Delish!"

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:57.646
RO: Delish!

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.821
IM: Wow, delish.

00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:00.976
All right. So where
should I position myself?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.490
I want to stay out of the way.
I don't want to be -- OK, here we go.

00:10:04.514 --> 00:10:06.245
RO: Do you get nervous, Ashley?

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:08.100
Ashley: Doing what?
RO: Cutting hair.

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:11.799
A: Never. I don't think there was ever
a day when I cut hair I was nervous.

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:14.508
IM: You look so cute already.
RO: You like it? All right.

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:18.055
IM: Do you have a problem looking cute?
RO: Of course I want to look cute.

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:21.908
IM: Just checking, because some people
want to look, you know, aggressively ugly.

00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:23.083
RO: No, not me, no.

00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:26.381
IM: You read about people
who have a lot of money and they have kids

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:30.103
and the kids always end up somehow,
really messed up, you know?

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:33.328
And there's got to be
some way to do that, Rosie.

00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:37.261
Just because you're fabulously rich
and fabulously famous,

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:39.144
does that mean you shouldn't have kids,

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:41.563
because you know they're going
to end up messed up?

00:10:41.587 --> 00:10:45.227
RO: No, but it means your priority
has to be their well-being first, I think.

00:10:45.251 --> 00:10:47.455
But you have to make
the decision for yourself.

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:49.309
My kids are seven, who the hell knows?

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:51.310
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:54.576
And they're going to be playing this clip.
"I'm such a good mother."

00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:57.714
My God, this is the shortest
I've ever had!

00:10:57.738 --> 00:10:58.889
IM: It looks good, yeah?

00:10:58.913 --> 00:11:02.611
A: Has your hair ever been this short?
RO: No! But it's all right -- go crazy.

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:04.894
IM: I feel like it needs to be
closer down here.

00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:07.169
A: It's just a stage.
RO: We're just staging it.

00:11:07.193 --> 00:11:09.067
IM: Are you freaking out? It's so cute.

00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.767
RO: No, I love it. It's the new me.
IM: It's so fabulous!

00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:13.147
RO: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:15.252
(Laughter)

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:19.692
IM: By the way, of all the most unboring
things in the world, right?

00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:23.280
I mean, like, making someone who's
already cute look terrible like that --

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:24.334
(Laughter)

00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:27.125
That is not boring.
That is nothing if it's not boring.

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:28.156
(Laughter)

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.560
Actually, I read this great
quote the other day, which was,

00:11:32.584 --> 00:11:34.319
"Style makes you feel great,

00:11:34.343 --> 00:11:37.536
because it takes your mind off the fact
that you're going to die."

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.711
Right?

00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:39.786
(Laughter)

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.525
And then I realized
that was on my website,

00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:45.112
and it said, you know,
the quote was attributed to me.

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:48.832
And I thought, "Oh, I said something
in an interview. I forgot I said that."

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.196
But it's really true.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.900
I want to show you this last clip
because it's going to be my last goodbye.

00:11:54.924 --> 00:11:56.724
I'll tell you that I cook a lot also.

00:11:56.748 --> 00:11:58.186
I love to cook.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.287
And I often look at things
as though they're food.

00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:03.554
Like, I say, "Would you serve
a rotten chicken?

00:12:03.578 --> 00:12:06.299
Then how could you serve
a beat-up old dress or something?

00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:08.288
How could you show a beat-up old dress?"

00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:11.039
I always relate things to kitchen-ry.

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.126
(Laughter)

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.108
And so I think
that's what it all boils down to.

00:12:15.132 --> 00:12:16.690
Everything boils down to that.

00:12:16.714 --> 00:12:17.871
So check this out.

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:19.280
This is what I've been doing,

00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:21.785
because I think it's the most
fun thing in the world.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:24.721
It's, like, this website
with a lot of different things on it.

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.285
It's a polymathematical website.

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:29.436
We actually shoot segments,
like TV show segments.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.344
And it's kind of my favorite
thing in the world.

00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:35.587
And it just began, like, in the beginning
of February. So who knows?

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:39.118
Again, I don't say it's good,
I just think it's not boring, right?

00:12:39.142 --> 00:12:40.643
And here's the last bit.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:43.198
(Music)

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:47.841
IM: I make buttermilk pancakes
or buttermilk waffles all the time.

00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:49.016
Sara Moulton: Do you?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.684
IM: Yeah, but I can never
find buttermilk, ever.

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:54.155
You can't find it at Citarella,
you can't find it.

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.096
SM: You can't?
IM: It's always low-fat.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.100
SM: But that's all it is.
IM: It is? OK.

00:12:58.124 --> 00:13:00.976
SM: You don't know?
Let me tell you something interesting.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.307
IM: You know what?
Stop laughing! It's not funny.

00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:06.530
Just because I don't know
there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.

00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.705
Sorry. What?

00:13:07.729 --> 00:13:11.067
SM: Here's the deal: in the old days,
when they used to make butter --

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:12.477
You know how you make butter?

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:13.794
IM: Churn.
SM: From cream.

00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:14.969
IM: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:18.042
SM: So you take heavy,
high-fat milk, which is cream,

00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:22.606
and you churn it until it separates
into these curds and water.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.515
The liquid is actually -- if you've
ever overbeaten your whipped cream,

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.181
it's actually buttermilk.

00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:29.976
That's what it was in the early days.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.976
And that's what people used
for baking and all sorts of things.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.077
Now the buttermilk that you get
is actually low-fat or skim milk.

00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.010
IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. Alright?

00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:39.699
SM: The reason he thought that

00:13:39.723 --> 00:13:43.131
is because buttermilk is so
wonderfully thick and delicious.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.368
IM: Yeah, it is. Exactly.

00:13:44.392 --> 00:13:46.530
SM: So who would think
that it was low-fat?

00:13:46.554 --> 00:13:48.657
IM: Well, that's it. Thank you very much.

00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:51.943
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here.
I love it. I love it. I love it.

00:13:51.967 --> 00:13:53.206
Thanks. Bye.
