WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're entering a second generation of no progress

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to go out and continue this very important thing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we as a species have always done.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that is, instinctively we've gone out

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I feel very strongly

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of a cell phone with a video in it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and help us survive in the future.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What we're looking forward to is --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Applause)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
what we're looking forward to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is not only the inspiration of our children,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is that right back to where we inspire people

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
who will be our great leaders later.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:


00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What they look at is the most important thing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
when marvelous things happened.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The ones that flew and landed OK

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because there were no trained pilots

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
who had good flying qualities by definition.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That has not happened at all in space flying.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, who was inspired during that time period?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and they've landed it only in the deserts.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and the blue line is commercial air transport.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that people could build in their garages.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
which is my company now.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that's kind of cool.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
These things tend to happen every 25 years.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
if the government develops and the government uses it.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
space flights in the world -- the very first year.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
There were only three or four flights in 2003.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
with my little group of a couple dozen people

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in order to get to a total of five,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
which was the number the same year back in 1961.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This is a picture here taken from orbit.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to go out and try that as a small company.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
There's another one announced just last week.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
is, there is not solutions for adequate safety

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
three governments have been doing this for 45 years,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I can't tell you when this will start,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
(Laughter)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
(Laughter)

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
but the home computer was for games.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
big development, big improvement and capability and so on,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And the inventor is in this audience.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
our communication and, if we let the Google guys

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So fun is defendable.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And in it also brings up another point, right here.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
There's a group of people that have come forward --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
right in this time period.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and it will lead us into the next really big thing

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There were a couple of examples here.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It went a whole life cycle without competition,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
took out of service. And we're stuck back here

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
with the same kind of capability for military fighters

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
or if you've got a 10-year-old now.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
why do you need something better?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because we lost the first two milestones.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
you can argue that's not a technical loss.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and that was a very strong thing.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
because a Russian space program is starving,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
when the space race was going on,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
when the commercial stuff is offered.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
This little thing says here: five times

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000
what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
will be at a level of about five times as much

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
OK, thank you very much.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
(Applause)
