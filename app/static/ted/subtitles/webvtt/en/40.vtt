00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I wanted to visualize the story of life.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But there were also revelations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the way it was three billion years ago,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
back before the sky turned blue.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There's stromatolites down there --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the first living things to capture photosynthesis --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it's the only place they still occur today.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Going down there was like entering a time capsule,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is what we all breathe today.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's a story about you and me, nature and science.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a short, brief journey of life through time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
solidifying into surface, molded by fire.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The moon was closer; things were different.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It arises around cracks in the Earth.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Growing living structures under an alien sky ...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And they changed the atmosphere.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
A breath that's fossilized now as iron.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Life needs a membrane to contain itself

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
so it can replicate and mutate.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
with skeletons of silicon ...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
circuit boards of the future.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
into more complex forms.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It grew as light and oxygen increased.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Life hardened and became defensive.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
among the first to leave the sea.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
True land plants arose, leafless at first.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The fundamental forms of ferns followed,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Life flourished in swamps.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It took time for life to break away from water,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and it still beckons all the time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And the dragons that arose are still among us today.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and the center of Brazil,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And others fly today like echoes of the past.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
In birds, life gained new mobility.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Water lilies were among the first.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
When the skies cleared, a new world was born.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
tenrecs, accustomed to the dark.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
New forms became bats. Civets.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Grasslands created opportunities.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Herd safety came with sharpened senses.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Some mammals turned back to water.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
becoming lemurs not much later.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We're molded by the same life force.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The blood veins in our hands

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And our brains -- our celebrated brains --

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Mars is still not very far.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and vice versa.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
(Applause)

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Thank you. Thank you.
