00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about my project, Tidying Up Art.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First of all -- any questions so far?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because I'm speaking in a foreign language,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if we Swiss try to speak American.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughter)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and you have to go on talking like this all the time.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it's more or less a picture book.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So the reading would be over very quickly.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You won't be familiar with it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this guy was looking at all day long.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
facing these unorganized red squares day after day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So I decided to give him a little support,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Laughter)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is particularly topsy-turvy.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I can show here a very good example.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's a picture by Paul Klee.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
(Laughter)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the whole thing is unstructured.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
(Laughter)

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We can see here he started out with orange,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and then he already ran out of orange,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Laughter)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yeah, that's great.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
What can you say? What a mess.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If my room back home had looked like this,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
my mother would have grounded me for three days.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And that's really advanced tidying up.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Applause)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
but that's actually more in Switzerland.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Laughter)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We are only happy when things are in order.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But to go on, here is a very good example to see.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This is a picture by Joan Miro.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Laughter)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And this is my --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's more economical and also more efficient.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because I've had my working methods patented

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'll just quote from the specification.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --"

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's not finished yet.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
des allgemeinen Formenschatzes

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I would like to do a short test with you.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
One, two, three.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
(Laughter)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
can sometimes lead to complete chaos.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
(Laughter)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
That's a picture by Keith Haring.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Laughter)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I think it doesn't matter.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Laughter)

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
One can see here quite clearly,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you can see we have 25 pale green elements,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
of which one is in the form of a circle.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
One can obviously also make combinations.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
(Laughter)

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
(Laughter)

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
(Laughter)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
(Laughter)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And here, that's one of my favorites.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
You know, there is a --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
(Laughter)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And you know, there you had this little sign --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So after a while I decided to have a little fun,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
(Laughter)

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And when I returned it looked like this.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Laughter)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
(Laughter)

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that like reacting that one or another picture

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
This is a picture by Rene Magritte,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
(Laughter)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Some people would make apple pie out of it.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
otherwise it would look like this.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
(Laughter)

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and put the paint back into the cans.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Applause)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Here I just brought it back to its original state.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000
(Laughter)

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and I collected together all his dots.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And now they're all in here.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
(Laughter)

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You can count them afterwards, if you like.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I mean, it's "the future we will create."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
(Laughter)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Laughter)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
where old Bruegel's people went?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
(Laughter)

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I just piled them up.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
(Laughter)

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
(Laughter)

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But before leaving I would like to show you,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I'm working right now on another -- in a related field

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And I started to bring some order into some flags.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Laughter)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And then maybe before I leave you ...

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Laughter)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Laughter)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(Applause)
