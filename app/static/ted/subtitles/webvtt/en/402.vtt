WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to 10,000 feet.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me explain why we are here

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or in some cases, non-existent.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
basically civilization's story so far.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's an incubator for about a dozen projects,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
all having to do with continuity over the long term.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that can really keep good time for that long a period.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Go to the clock. And what we have here is something

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
many of you saw here three years ago.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's the first working prototype of the clock.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's about nine feet high.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So the design problem for today is going to be,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, this was the first solution.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Alexander Rose came up with this idea

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
about, what does deep time do to a building?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Well, this is what deep time does to a building.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and look what happened to it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Even the most durable and intactable buildings,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They've been looted inside and out.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
How about underground with a view?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Underground in a place that's really solid.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You don't want just any mountain.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You need absolutely the right mountain

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So here's an image of the long view of the search problem.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We looked at mesas in New Mexico.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
led us to Eastern Nevada,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to America's newest and oldest national park,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
which is called Great Basin National Park.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and on the right it's gentle.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Inside the green line is national forest.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
this vertical, was available because it was private land.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That's a 2,000-foot thick formation,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to get up to where the clock is.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
of the goal at the end of the journey.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
In this case it might well be an image of the clock.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Then there should always be in sight the draw --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to finish the process of getting there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
spent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,"

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
so that a peal of 10 bells

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
January 7003. There it is.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
OK, back to Danny's list.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Then there's the return.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. 


00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And then, how about a memento? Number seven.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
At the end of it there's something physical,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
a kind of reward that you take away.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Something that's just yours.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
How do you study a mountain

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
for the kinds of things we're talking about?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is not a normal building project.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
What do you look for?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that's national park. That's sacrosanct --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There's possibilities. The borders are important.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
They're the world's oldest living thing.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
some of them go back 10,000 years.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The stone itself is absolutely beautiful,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
join us on the expedition.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
That's interesting.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. 


00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
was discovered, led by a theory.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Edmund Schulman in the 1950s

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
called, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And then, based on that principle, he started looking around

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
at the various trees at Timberline,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and realized that the bristlecone pines --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. 


00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:54.000
when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
(Laughter)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and take a hell of a tax deduction.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
(Laughter)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
as you'll see when we go inside in a minute,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And shale is not quite completely competent rock.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The shale would like some shoring,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and so parts of it are caved in in there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
on some of the collapsed timbers.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and it dates back to 1870.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
That's what the property was originally built around --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and it ran year round.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You may recognize a couple of the miners there.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, 


00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And they also found four species of bats in there.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
They don't quite, but it's something to think about.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
They don't quite meet.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Way more interesting than Monterey even today.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And it's a pretty interesting scene.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
who's the regional head of the National Forest Service,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
10,000-year temporary use permit.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
(Laughter)

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The weather station's pretty interesting.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It runs on solar, and it sends a signal
with that antenna

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then sent through landlines to San Francisco,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
where we put the data in real time up on our website.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Let's go to approaches.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
just a few old mining roads like this,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
so you have to bushwhack everywhere.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. 


00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Well, here's a potential approach.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And you can carry right on up through meadows

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
where there's a bit of a problem.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
"Make the clock inaccessible.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
but your emotional affect goes up,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
which is great for having a mythic experience,


00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
whether you want to or not.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
by how much math he can't do in his head.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Laughter)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote, 


00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful."

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien."

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful."

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And then, of course, the next thing I hear is,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And he dashed across the top of the mountains.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and a solo ascent at that.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and what to do with them.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
How about Zander's Crevice? No.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
(Laughter)

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Zander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
called the Siq, and so this is the Siq.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and I'm not sure you can.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and that brings it out.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and Danny looked over to the right

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and noticed something halfway up the cliffs,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And the people toiling up the mountain could see them,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
How did they get there? Do I have to do that?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You can get another angle on Danny's porch

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. 


00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
the clock will keep perfectly good time.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So here we're looking from the south, look north.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
that's some of the Long Now land in those trees.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000
That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
That's what it looks like looking down it.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We should probably put in a rail or something.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
You also see there a bighorn sheep.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
because the real peak is hidden around the corner.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And as it turned out the answer is, yes,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
and that might be conjured with.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
One is the experience of the mountain.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Another is the experience in the mountain.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And the third is the experience from the mountain,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
which is really dominated by the view shed

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
of the spring valley there behind Danny,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and if you look off to the right, out there,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
using the water from the mountains.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and I'll take you there for a minute.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
It's a very nice ranch.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
you'll see what the valley used to look like.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, 


00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
The clock experience should be profound,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
but from the outside it should be invisible.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And then you could have an entrance

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
which was very rough and narrow as you first went in,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And this stone takes a perfect polish.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
of the basic structure of the mountain,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. 


00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
This is architecture not made by building,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
but by what you very carefully take away.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So that's what the mountain taught us.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Most of the amazingness of the clock

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
They say, "pin peya obe" -- welcome to the mountain.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Thank you.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
(Applause)
