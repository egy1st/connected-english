00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And it's an African story.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There was Hollywood.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then came Bollywood.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And it's expanding.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is something that happened without foreign investment,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The industry is 15 years old.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so maybe you're thinking now,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is so interested in this story?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a few things about my personal life,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
because I think there is a connection.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I was born in Zambia.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Even though I left when I was only three years old,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And it really was a place where I learned to walk.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think I uttered the first words,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and my family bought their first home.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So when we came back to Italy,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and one of the things that I remember the most

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is my family having this hard time to share stories.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that probably exists only in their imagination,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or the place of horror, famine.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so we were always caught in this stereotype.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and have dreams like we all have.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the story of Nollywood,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that goes against all these preconceived notions.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And we really look how digital technology is changing,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and how young, independent filmmakers

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
can make movies at a fraction of the cost.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So when I proposed the story,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I really had all the support to make this film.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And not only had the support,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
who is a veteran of National Geographic,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I don't know if I have come across a story

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that is so full of hope and so fun."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we went to Lagos in October 2005.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of this incredible film industry,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
following Bond in his quest to make an action movie

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that deals with the issue of corruption,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
called "Checkpoint."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Police corruption.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And he had nine days to make it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We thought this was a good story.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But I don't want to create too many expectations.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I would like to show you six minutes.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
There are several themes from the documentary,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So I guess it's a world premier.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Video)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Man: Action.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And you shoot in seven days.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Peace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We're not doing films for the elite

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and the people in their glass houses.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and where you have big budgets.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Here is that you make these films,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I believe in the power of audiovisuals.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I think it's the most viable vehicle right now

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to pass information across a dedicated cable.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
put in a message in there.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Woman: You still have to report the incident.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
He needs proper medical attention.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
PP: I keep trying to explain to people,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
but the first thing you have to remember about this society

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and these are the people that really watch these films.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that has just been born in this part of the world.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Lancelot Imasen: But our films,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
They are stories about our people, for our people.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And consistently, they are glued to their screen

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
whenever they see the story.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's the blockbuster comedy.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You'll crack your ribs.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's all about the foreign movies.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But we can do something too.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We can do something, something that when the world sees it,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
they say, wow, this is Nigeria.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Don't embarrass yourself.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
It’s not just what you see in picture.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You see the person live.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You see how he talks. You see how he lives.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
He influences you really good, you know.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It’s not just what you see in the picture.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Man: See you. Bye.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Action.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But then when I discovered the situation in my country,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
at that time there was so much corruption.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
For a young man to really make it out here,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
you got to think of some negative things and all that,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
or some kind of vices.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And I didn't want that, you know.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Just me and God-given talent.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Man: Let's go.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
OK, it's time to kick some ass.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Cover this. It's your own.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Move it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
they have all these things in place.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
The masking tape will hold it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I'm trying to protect my face too.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This ain't going to be my last movie.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
with or without any assistance from anybody.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Man: Action.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Cut.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So many themes in this story.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that is incredible.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And I think they’re breathing.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And so it's a very, very important thing for them,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and for their audiences.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better."

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
There is also another very important thing

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that I hope will resonate with this audience.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And this has unleashed tremendous energy.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And guess what?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
They understood it, they embraced the technology

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and they run with it, and they’re successful.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
create a narrative for the population, something to identify,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
something positive, something that really is psychological relief

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and it's part of the culture.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I really think it goes both ways.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and make a buck and live with this job."

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So I really think it’s a lesson

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
that we're actually learning from them.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And I think this is really the theme of this session.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
No stories around the campfire.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
No legends, no fairytales.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Nothing.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
No novels.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Difficult, eh? It's meaningless.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So this is what I really think.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I think that the key to a healthy society

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is a thriving community of storytellers,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I would like you to hear their voices.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Just a few moments.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that’s Nollywood.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
we'll have that original Nigerian movie.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
BE: It’s still the same basic themes.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Love, action.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that in the natal lifetimes,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
where we teach each other things.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And I really hope that this will happen.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Applause)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
There is scientific data on this.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
CA: 2,000 films a year?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And we know that there are more.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So imagine 45 films per week.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
There are challenges. There are challenges.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
There is a glut of film,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but I’m optimistic.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
these are films that are distributed directly in markets.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
They are bought in video shops.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
They can be rented for pennies.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
CA: On what format?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
They started with VHS.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
They started in '92, '94.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
(Laughter)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
it's a commodity, it's a staple.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
There is no life without stories.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
CA: Franco, thank you so much.
