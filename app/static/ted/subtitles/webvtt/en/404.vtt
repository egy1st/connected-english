WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so, I have my first slide to talk about

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the dawning of the universe and what I call

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then following it up and trying to understand it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so one of the questions that I asked you is,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when you look around, what do you see?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, you see this space that's created by designers

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and by the work of people, but what you actually see

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is a lot of material that was already here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
being reshaped in a certain form.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so the question is: how did that material get here?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's a question of what's the continuity?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So one of the things I look at is,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how did the universe begin and shape?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you look at this picture,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and you can see them there -- little pluses.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you can see easily with your eye in here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
an art design college conference going on,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
trying to figure out what's going on over here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
how come there are so many galaxies?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is only 1,000 galaxies.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if you had the time to scan it around --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's a very large number of galaxies.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
what kind of creative process and what kind of design

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
produced the world like that?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We're going to try and follow it up.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
just because that's where we're making observations.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Two seconds is like the present.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You'd like to have a little advance warning.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because it takes light long enough to go there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it's thousands of years ago.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and it's two million years ago.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because we don't think there were humans yet.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I mean, it just gives you the scale.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
there's some things even further,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so that's the sort of sequence,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You see the whole big picture?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But you can see the edge of the Sun,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which is actually incredibly uniform.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but there are these very tiny variations

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which we show here in great exaggeration.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So it's a big design job,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but we'll see about how things are going on.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So the way these measurements were done,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and we discovered these variations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and it made somewhat better pictures.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and it will make very high-resolution maps.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And that will be the sequence of understanding

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the very beginning of the universe.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and about the contents of the universe,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and about how the universe started in its original motions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And it's maturing up to the present time.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And there's some spectacular things.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What kind of evidence do we have for that?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So let me show you some of nature's patterns

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that are the result of this.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And just put radially they're going out that way.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What happens is, you take pictures

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So there's an interesting pattern,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We only have a million galaxies, right?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but, what's going on?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There's another survey which is very similar to this,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because there's a redshift measurement and everything,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so this is the real representation.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's hard to see the pattern of this.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that we see out there.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But you can see the voids,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you can see the complicated structure, and you say,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
well, how did this happen?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's not just throwing them out at random.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
There's a more complicated process going on here.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
How are you going to end up doing that?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And so now we're in for some serious play.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That is, we have to seriously play God,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
What's the kind of technique?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and some simple rules,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And then you put in some randomness,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
some fluctuations and some randomness,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So what I'm going to do is show you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's called dark matter.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That is matter that doesn't interact with light

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the typical way that ordinary matter does,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we're going to make it white. OK?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It should be called invisible matter,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but the dark matter we've made visible.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So I'll show you the next movie.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So this -- we're going to zoom in.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This one we're zooming in on

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So we live in the boonies.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We don't live in the center of the solar system,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we don't live in the center of the galaxy

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So we're zooming in.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
on the order of a million galaxies in that region.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
A parsec is 3.26 light years.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now we're going to zoom back out,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and you can see this structure that,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
when we get very far out, looks very regular,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So they're simple building blocks.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
develops into this complicated structure.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And so you know when you first saw this picture,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it didn't mean quite so much to you.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but you realize they're not even the main structure.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So here's that same end result.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You see a filament,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you see the light is the invisible matter,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and you can see what it looks like.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
complicated kind of a design, right?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And it's grown up in some kind of way.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So the question is,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
How big a contractor team would you need

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to put this universe together, right?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That's the issue, right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And so here we are.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
You see how the filament --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you see how several filaments are coming together,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
everything would be distorted,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
it might look to you, right?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And if you could see invisible matter, too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
in a very simple way?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
plus our other instruments,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but expanding at a tremendous rate.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And those fluctuations

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in order to make just this simple visible one.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So I'm going to show you one

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So you start out with teeny fluctuations

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
when the universe was at this point,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
now four times smaller, and so forth.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and it just has the dark matter in it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And you see how the dark matter lumps up,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So there it is.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
At the beginning it's very uniform.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But the distances on the universe are so large

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
in terms of its expansion.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and then only things that have started forming already

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And that design is sort of way beyond

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
what our original imagination ever was.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Since then we've had WMAP,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
which just gives us higher angular resolution.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
We see the same large-scale structure,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
but we see additional small-scale structure.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
all the major continents, but that's about it.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Geology has these effects,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
which is moving the plates around and so forth.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
You can see that just from the map alone.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
we can see whether there are any non-linear effects

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So that's where we are today,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and that's what I wanted to give you 
a flavor of.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Give you a different view about what the design

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and what everything else looks like.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Thank you.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
(Applause)
