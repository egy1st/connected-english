00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I went to Spain a few months ago

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I had the best foie gras of my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The best culinary experience of my life.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Ridiculous, right?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Foie gras and the future of cooking.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I mean, it's crucified.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you risk being attacked.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not saying that there's not a rationale

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for being opposed to foie gras.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Basically you take a goose or a duck

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Its liver expands by eight times.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
(Laughter)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I mean, I love the stuff.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes, sure.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Not a lot of people are doing it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And for good reason.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Eduardo Sousa.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Natural foie gras.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What's natural about foie gras?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
geese and ducks gorge on food

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and eat what they want.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So no gavage, no force feeding,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And it's shockingly not a new idea.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
His great-granddad started -- PaterÃ­a de Sousa -- in 1812.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And they've been doing it quietly ever since.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That is until last year,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the coveted French gastronomic prize.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's like the Olympics of food products.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
He placed first for his foie gras.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Big, big problem.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He said it sort of gleefully.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It was all over the papers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I read about it. It was in Le Monde.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
They accused him of paying off the judges.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Huh, amazing.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A huge scandal for a few weeks.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Couldn't find a shred of evidence.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now, look at the guy.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for his foie gras.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So that died down, and very soon afterward,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
new controversy.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
There's no force feeding.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I would have said, "That's kind of true."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and that's what you get when you want foie gras.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is utterly simple.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And he said to me, really from the first moment,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
my life's work is to give the geese what they want.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I'm just here to give the geese what they want.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
taking pictures of them

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
like his children in the grass.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Amazing.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
He's really just in love with -- he's at one with --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
he's the goose whisperer.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
like I'm speaking to you now, right,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because the more I got to know him and his system,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the more exciting this whole idea became.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He kept going like this to me.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
so you know, I slowed down.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And finally, by the end of the day I was like,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Ed-uar-do, you know like this?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But he was still going like this.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I figured it out.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I was speaking too loudly.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So I hushed my voice.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in kind of a half whisper.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And he stopped doing this.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
"Get the hell away from this kid!" --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Right up to us, like right up to here.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Right along the fence line.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And fence line was amazing in itself.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's totally backward with him.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The electricity on this fiberglass fence

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is only on the outside.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
He rewired it. He invented it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I've never seen it. Have you?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
He doesn't.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He electrifies only the outside.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Why?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
with figs and everything else.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
He felt like they felt manipulated.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So he got rid of the electricity,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
he got rid of current on the inside

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and kept it on the outside,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Now, what happened?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They ate, and he showed me on a chart,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The landscape is incredible.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I mean, his farm is incredible.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It really is the Garden of Eden.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
There's figs and everything else there for the taking.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
what does Extremadura mean?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Extra hard land, right?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Extra difficult. Extra hard.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But over four generations, he and his family

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Upgrades the life for these geese.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And they are allowed to take whatever they want.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Another irony, the double irony

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
is that on the figs and the olives,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Eduardo can make more money selling those

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
than he can on the foie gras.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
He doesn't care.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
He lets them take what they want and he says,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Part of the income for his farm.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A big part of his income for his farm.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But he never controls it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
They get what they want,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they leave the rest for me and I sell it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
That's how I've been trained.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You want to look and see what good foie gras is,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it's got to be bright yellow.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Well, because he doesn't force feed,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
his livers were pretty grey.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Or they were.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And the geese love the Lupin bush.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Not for the bush, but for the seeds.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Radioactive yellow.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Bright yellow.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
(Laughter)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and it was always nature.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It was never him.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
into working with his landscape.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
but increasingly, eating up his every word.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And he grabs my arm and the translator's,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
"Shush, watch this."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And this squadron of geese come over.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[Clapping]

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
they're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then they circle around.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
[Clapping]

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And the wild geese are calling down.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
[Clapping]

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and they land.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And I'm just saying, "No way."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
(Laughter)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
No way.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to say come for a visit?"

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And he says, "No, no, no.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They've come to stay."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They've come to stay?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Laughter)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
He said, "No, no, no.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
To happiness.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They find it here.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They don't need anything more."

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and his flock continues.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Think about that for a minute.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It's brilliant, right?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farm

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
in, like, North Carolina,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and decides to stay.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So how did it taste?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I finally got to taste it before I left.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It was incredible.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this guy's a genius, you know?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm really in love with him at this point.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I'd had something that was called foie gras.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
But this was transformative. Really transformative.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And I say to you, I might not stick to this,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because of that taste experience with Eduardo.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It was sweet, it was unctuous.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It had all the qualities of foie gras,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I was sure of it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I'm not like some super taster, you know?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But I can taste things.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
There's 100 percent star anise in there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And he says, "No."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And I ended up like going down the spices,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But no.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
he sticks them in this jar

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and he confits it.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
What?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
We went back out for the final tour of the farm,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and he showed me the wild pepper plants

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
He doesn't need salt and pepper.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that his geese love to gorge on.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I turned to him at the end of the meal,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and it's a question I asked several times,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
some of the greatest chefs in the world are --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
How come you don't give him this?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
How come no one's really heard of you?"

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it may be because of the wine,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
or it may be because of my excitement,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And he was right.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
He was right.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They create a dish

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
where all the vectors point at us.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And as he said, I think fittingly,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Simple.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I really was moved.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
is this note that says, when asked,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
what do you think of conventional foie gras?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
What do you think of foie gras that

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
99.99999 percent of the world eats?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
He said, "I think it's an insult to history."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I wrote, insult to history.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
What the hell does that mean?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Insult to history.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So I did some research when I got back,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and here's what I found.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The history of foie gras.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Jews invented foie gras.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
True story.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
True story.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
By accident.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Gotten sick of the chicken fat.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
They were looking for an alternative.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
The Pharaoh got wind of this --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
This is true, right off the Internet.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter)

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I swear to God.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
(Laughter)

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He tasted it and fell in love with it.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
He started demanding it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And the Jews, fearing for their life,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
had to come up with an ingenious idea,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And they invented, what? Gavage.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and the good stuff they kept for themselves.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
That's the history of foie gras.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And if you think about it,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
it's the history of industrial agriculture.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's the history of what we eat today.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Most of what we eat today.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
long-distance travel, food processing.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
All of it, our food system.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
That's also an insult to history.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
It's an insult to the basic laws of nature

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and of biology.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Whether we're talking about beef cattle

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
or we're talking about chickens,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
or in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish --

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
which wholesale are going out of business.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It's rooted in extraction.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Take more, sell more, waste more.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And for the future it won't serve us.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Jonas Salk has a great quote.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
He said, "If all the insects disappeared,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And he's right.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Really new.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
One in which we stop treating the planet

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And stop degrading resources under the guise of

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
cheap food.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Farmers that rely on nature

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
for solutions, for answers,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
rather than imposing solutions on nature.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Listening as Janine Benyus,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
"Listening to nature's operating instructions."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000
is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and for people that care about food and cooking,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
is that the most ecological choice for food

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
is also the most ethical choice for food.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
but almost always, the most delicious choice.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
That's serendipitous.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Thank you.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
(Applause)
