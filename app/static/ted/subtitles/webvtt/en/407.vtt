00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
make education seem like a bright idea.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Great creativity can make politicians electable,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or parties unelectable.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and phrases on our lips.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
through an impenetrable moral maze.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
more magical. And now we need that magic.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a time of need.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
To tempt us to act differently

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
with delightful creative scraps.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
using creativity to inspire people to be greener.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and broken his heart.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Sure, she had aged a little.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In fact, she had aged a lot.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But he felt all his old passion for her return.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
for that was his name.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Let's go there and make love. In the tent."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The earth moved for both of them.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And they lived together happily ever after.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And all because he decided to walk that day.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
(Applause)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The moral imperative is on the table.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Great creativity is needed to take it all,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
make it simple and sharp.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So this is a call, a plea,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to the incredibly talented TED community.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Let's get creative against climate change.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And let's do it soon. Thank you.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Applause)
