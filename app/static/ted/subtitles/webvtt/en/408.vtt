00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Unless we do something to prevent it,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of neurologic diseases on a global scale.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A cheery thought.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
On this map, every country that’s colored blue

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the world we live in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And this is the world your children will live in.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It’s already flattening out.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is why it’s happening.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’s

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for which we have no cure or prevention --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that should be folded up properly

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
misfolds into a kind of demented origami.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that function like molecular Scotch tape,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to hold the protein into its proper shape.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That would keep it from forming the tangles

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which affect very different parts of the brain

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
also show tangles of misfolded protein,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which suggests that the approach might be a general one,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
not just Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because people with neurologic diseases

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
have a very low incidence of most cancers.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but which we’re fascinated by.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is being funded by private philanthropies.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
here’s what you can do for yourself.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You should also keep your blood pressure down,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because chronic high blood pressure

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
"use it or lose it" applies,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so you want to stay mentally stimulated.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But hey, you’re listening to me.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So you’ve got that covered.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Thank you.
