00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The north coast of California has rainforests --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's 38 stories tall.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because nobody has ever drilled into any of them

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that are older than that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The largest individuals of this species,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
where the rain is really intense.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
wild and now protected -- entirely protected --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to this day remain under-explored.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and even today, individual trees are being discovered

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a kind loaner from TED.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We're going to show you what the diameter

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
at breast height of a big Redwood is.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Unfortunately, this tape isn't long enough -- it's only a 25-foot tape.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Chris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now, let your imagination go upward into space.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
upward into space over long periods of time.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
moving upward into space, articulating themselves

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the Lost Monarch.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and was discovered in 1998.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
you're not seeing the organism.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and most of the organism is overhead, unseen.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Steve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
at Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
That is to say, at that time it was believed

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
until he got to the top of the tree.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
His friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Neither one of them had noticed that there was

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
He would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But they made it to the top, and what they found

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now, I had been working on other topics:

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the emergence of infectious diseases,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
make a trans-species jump, and get into humans.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
After three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
My wife and I adore our children.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
using the so-called arborist climbing technique,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's my son, Oliver.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Laughter)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that are afraid of heights.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
All other primates, when they're scared,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
they run up a tree, where they feel safe.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
coming in three dimensions around us.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
because they've never seen them in the canopy before.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
where you can move from tree to tree through space,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
rather like Spiderman.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It became a writing project.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
which trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
You ascend 30 stories.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
There are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
You do feel a sense of exposure.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
There is a small person right down there on the ground.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But then you enter the Redwood canopy,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and it's like coming through a layer of clouds.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and you also lose sight of the sky,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
These are huckleberry bushes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Many species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
in fact, it's difficult to move.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with living things that don't occur near the ground.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's like scuba diving into a coral reef,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
except you're going upward instead of downward.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Maria's sitting on one of them.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
These limbs could be five to six hundred years old.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that are technically known as huckleberry afros,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This reiteration is a huge flying buttress

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that comes out the tree itself.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and extends upward for 150 feet.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
There's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
a synthetic chromosome into a human

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
would be people who looked like us,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and they would have people on their hands and so on.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And if we had Redwood-like biology,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and have all our reiterations wave at the same time.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
(Laughter)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
To reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We're looking at that yellow box.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And there's also something that I want to show you.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
This is a flying buttress.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and help the tree exist longer through time.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
They've wired them like patients in an ICU.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and down into their trunks,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
possibly all the way into their root systems.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the Redwood will send roots into its own form

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
then we could just, you know,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that have, as yet, no names.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
hundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
is completely unknown.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There are some interesting theories

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that, if I had time, I would tell you about.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But as you go and you look closer at a tree,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
what you see is, you see increasing complexity.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
no one really knows, but its top has broken off

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and it's been rotting back now.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to form in its complexity that we see right now.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
As you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
at the conclusion of this talk.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And we're moving in a full circle now.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
this kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
of the Eastern Hemlock species --

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
for which these trees are merely the substrate

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's absolutely heartbreaking to see.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The flickering, transitory quality of human time

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
something about ourselves in the differences that we have.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
We are human, and we have the capacity to love,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
that so suits us as primates, I think.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
an entirely new way of loving my children.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Exploring with them the forest canopy

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
with my children I've been able to introduce them

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:02.000
(Applause)

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
that are not found anywhere on the Earth

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
except on that one tree. Is that correct?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
was only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and so no specimens have ever been collected.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
RP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases --

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
parasites that move into the human species.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
But that's just a very small facet

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself --

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
RP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and the continents are rooms in the palace,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and the islands are small rooms.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and the walls are coming down.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
CA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
RP: Thank you.
