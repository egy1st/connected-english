00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.888
People love their automobiles.

00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:04.976
They allow us to go
where we want to when we want to.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.615
They're a form of entertainment,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.640
they're a form of art,

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:10.346
a pride of ownership.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.039
Songs are written about cars.

00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:14.398
Prince wrote a great song:
"Little Red Corvette."

00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:17.872
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop
Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil."

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:19.090
He wrote about a car.

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:20.976
One of my favorites has always been:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.975
"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.355
because that was my vehicle
when I was in college.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.788
The fact is, when we do
our market research around the world,

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.805
we see there's a nearly universal
aspiration on the part of people

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:34.983
to own an automobile --

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.773
750 million people
in the world today own a car.

00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:41.342
And you say, boy, that's a lot.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.522
But you know what?

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.681
That's just 12 percent of the population.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.839
We really have to ask the question:

00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:49.582
Can the world sustain
that number of automobiles?

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:53.474
And if you look at projections
over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,

00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:56.794
it looks like the world
car park could grow

00:00:56.818 --> 00:00:59.753
to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.452
If you park those end to end
and wrap them around the Earth,

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:06.822
that would stretch
around the Earth 125 times.

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:10.132
Now, we've made great progress
with automobile technology

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.797
over the last 100 years.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.658
Cars are dramatically cleaner,
dramatically safer, more efficient

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:19.382
and radically more affordable
than they were 100 years ago.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.975
But the fact remains:

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.475
the fundamental DNA of the automobile
has stayed pretty much the same.

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:29.767
If we were to reinvent the automobile
today, rather than 100 years ago,

00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.596
knowing what we know about the issues
associated with our product

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.079
and about the technologies
that exist today,

00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:37.298
what would we do?

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:39.562
We wanted something
that was really affordable.

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:41.269
The fuel cell looked great:

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:43.014
one-tenth as many moving parts,

00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:46.163
a fuel-cell propulsion system
as an internal combustion engine,

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:47.392
and it emits just water.

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.778
And we wanted to take
advantage of Moore's Law

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:51.643
with electronic controls and software,

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.706
and we absolutely wanted
our car to be connected.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.610
So we embarked upon the reinvention
around an electrochemical engine,

00:01:58.634 --> 00:01:59.790
the fuel cell,

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:01.798
and hydrogen as the energy carrier.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.331
First was Autonomy.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.412
Autonomy really set the vision
for where we wanted to head.

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:10.476
We embodied all of the key components
of a fuel-cell propulsion system.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.171
We then had Autonomy
drivable with Hy-Wire,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.476
and we showed Hy-Wire here
at this conference last year.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.663
Hy-Wire is the world's first
drivable fuel cell,

00:02:19.687 --> 00:02:22.476
and we have followed
up that now with Sequel.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.476
And Sequel truly is a real car.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.272
So if we could run the video --

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.859
(Futuristic music)

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.471
[Reinventing the Automobile]

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:17.727
(Video) It truly is my great pleasure
to introduce Sequel.

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:36.793
[Acceleration]

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.992
[Cruising]

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:45.009
[Steering]

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:49.239
[Braking]

00:03:52.817 --> 00:03:55.570
But the real key question
I'm sure that's on your mind:

00:03:55.594 --> 00:03:57.570
Where is the hydrogen going to come from?

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:00.760
And secondly, when are these kinds
of cars going to be available?

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.984
So let me talk about hydrogen first.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.626
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come
from so many different sources:

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.413
it can come from fossil fuels,

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:11.198
it can come from any way
that you can create electricity,

00:04:11.222 --> 00:04:12.858
including renewables.

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:14.673
And it can come from biofuels.

00:04:14.697 --> 00:04:16.215
And that's quite exciting.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.491
The vision here is to have each local
community play to its natural strength

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:21.814
in creating the hydrogen.

00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:24.190
A lot of hydrogen is produced
today in the world.

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:26.498
It's produced to get
sulfur out of gasoline --

00:04:26.522 --> 00:04:28.329
which I find is somewhat ironic.

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:30.960
It's produced in the fertilizer industry;

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:34.206
it's produced in the chemical
manufacturing industry.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.619
That hydrogen is being made

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:38.308
because there's a good
business reason for its use.

00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:40.896
But it tells us that we know
how to create it,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.193
we know how to create it cost-effectively,

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:45.484
we know how to handle it safely.

00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:46.705
We did an analysis

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.325
where you would have
a station in each city

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.476
with each of the 100 largest cities
in the United States,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.476
and located the stations

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.476
so you'd be no more than two miles
from a station at any time.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.809
We put one every 25 miles on the freeway,

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.838
and it turns out that translates
into about 12,000 stations.

00:05:03.862 --> 00:05:07.227
And at a million dollars each,
that would be about 12 billion dollars.

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:08.476
That's a lot of money.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.595
But if you built the Alaskan
pipeline today,

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.700
that's half of what the Alaskan
pipeline would cost.

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:17.724
But the real exciting vision
that we see, truly, is home refueling,

00:05:17.748 --> 00:05:21.373
much like recharging your laptop
or recharging your cell phone.

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:24.436
So we're pretty excited
about the future of hydrogen.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.476
We think it's a question of not whether,
but a question of when.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.276
What we've targeted for ourselves --

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.825
and we're making great progress
toward this goal --

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.341
is to have a propulsion system
based on hydrogen and fuel cells,

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:38.087
designed and validated,

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:41.056
that can go head-to-head
with the internal combustion engine.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.087
We're talking about obsoleting
the internal combustion engine,

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.152
and doing it in terms
of affordability at scale volumes,

00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:49.575
its performance and its durability.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.290
So that's what we're driving to for 2010.

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:54.792
We haven't seen anything yet
in our development work

00:05:54.816 --> 00:05:56.292
that says that isn't possible.

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:59.436
We actually think the future
is going to be event-driven.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.437
So since we can't predict the future,

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.476
we want to spend a lot of our time
trying to create that future.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.920
I'm very, very intrigued

00:06:05.944 --> 00:06:10.475
by the fact that our cars and trucks
sit idle 90 percent of the time:

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:12.698
they're parked all around us.

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:16.073
They're usually parked within 100 feet
of the people that own them.

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:19.876
Now, if you take the power-generating
capability of an automobile

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.129
and you compare that to the electric grid
in the United States,

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:27.746
it turns out that the power
in four percent of the automobiles

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.333
equals that of the electric
grid of the US.

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.258
That's a huge power-generating capability,

00:06:33.282 --> 00:06:35.388
a mobile power-generating capability.

00:06:35.412 --> 00:06:38.389
And hydrogen and fuel cells
give us that opportunity

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:41.191
to actually use our cars and trucks
when they're parked

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:43.192
to generate electricity for the grid.

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:45.341
We talked about swarm networks earlier.

00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:48.742
Talk about the ultimate swarm --
having all of the processors

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.910
and all of the cars
when they're sitting idle

00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:54.436
being part of a global grid
for computing capability.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.121
We find that premise quite exciting.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:59.383
The automobile becomes,
then, an appliance --

00:06:59.407 --> 00:07:00.683
not in a commodity sense,

00:07:00.707 --> 00:07:03.476
but an appliance, mobile power,
mobile platform

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.115
for information and computing
and communication,

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.476
as well as a form of transportation.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.127
And the key to all of this
is to make it affordable,

00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:12.302
to make it exciting,

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:15.467
to get it on a pathway where
there's a way to make money doing it.

00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:18.476
And again, this is a pretty
big march to take here.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.653
A lot of people say:

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:20.871
How do you sleep at night

00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:23.514
when you're wrestling with a problem
of that magnitude?

00:07:23.538 --> 00:07:26.702
I tell them I sleep like a baby:
I wake up crying every two hours.

00:07:26.726 --> 00:07:27.869
(Laughter)

00:07:27.893 --> 00:07:30.191
Actually, the theme
of this conference, I think,

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:32.589
has hit on one of the major keys
to pull that off,

00:07:32.613 --> 00:07:34.803
and that's relationships
and working together.

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:35.997
Thank you very much.

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.332
(Applause)

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:44.034
Chris Anderson: Larry, Larry -- wait,
wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.

00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.344
I've got so many questions
I could ask you.

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:49.305
I just want to ask one.

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:51.183
You know, I could be wrong about this,

00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:54.831
but my sense is that
in the public mind today,

00:07:54.855 --> 00:08:01.256
GM is not viewed as as serious
about some of these environmental ideas

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.401
as some of your Japanese
competitors, maybe even as Ford.

00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.195
Are you serious about it,

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:11.476
and not just, you know,
when the consumers want it,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.140
when the regulators force us
to do it, we will go there?

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:16.666
Will you guys really try
and show leadership on this?

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.078
Larry Burns: Absolutely.
We're absolutely serious.

00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:21.359
We're into this
over a billion dollars already,

00:08:21.383 --> 00:08:23.670
so I would hope people
would think we're serious

00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:25.679
when we're spending that kind of money.

00:08:25.703 --> 00:08:28.711
And secondly, it's a fundamental
business proposition.

00:08:28.735 --> 00:08:29.891
I'll be honest with you;

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.216
we're into it for business
growth opportunities.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.980
We can't grow our business
unless we solve these problems.

00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:38.384
The growth of the auto industry
will be capped by sustainability issues

00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:39.906
if we don't solve the problems.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.426
And there's a simple principle
of strategy that says:

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.499
Do unto yourself
before others do unto you.

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.428
If we can see this possible
future, others can, too.

00:08:47.452 --> 00:08:49.929
And we want to be the first one
to create it, Chris.
