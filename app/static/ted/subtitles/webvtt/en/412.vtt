00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In 1962, Buckminster Fuller

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and deeply affect the decision making of this body

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
through animations of global data, trends

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And today, 45 years later,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but what we do have is improved technology.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can use LEDs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Most importantly for this, they're faster.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There are four on-board micro-controllers

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that, each time this ring rotates

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it, as it passes the rear of the display,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it picks up a position signal.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And from that, the on-board micro-controllers

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But this is really just the beginning.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
These blocks represent LEDs.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it will create a disc of light that we can control.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that's the rims that you can buy for your car.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And so we can control that with micro-controllers

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now this piece is currently in process --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I've got a little video to show you,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and this is also with only four LEDs.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So, take a look.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then, as the other axis kicks in,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
those actually blur into a volume.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And the shutter speed of the camera

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But this piece is due out in May.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This piece, actually, will be on display

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in the breaks between now and the end of the show.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to come down and take a closer look.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
