00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I understand that this meeting was planned,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the slogan was From Was to Still.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I am illustrating Still.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
although I am 94, I am not still working.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So this takes care of my age.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This was about 1925.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
All of these things were made during the last 75 years.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
(Applause)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, of course, I'm working since 25,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
(Applause)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
These were just some of the things I've made.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I call myself a maker of things.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Industrial designers want to make novel things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Well, to describe our profession otherwise,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that all useful qualities and all material qualities

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
were developed from the playful search for beauty."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000
because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:38.000
produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So how can you, without drying up,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Let me tell you some about my life.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
My first exhibition in the United States

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
My work actually took me through many countries,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and showed me a great part of the world.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and I worked as the apprentice.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And there I really worked as an apprentice.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
My master took me to set ovens

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And finally, I had received a document

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Chimney Sweeps and Potters.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
(Laughter)

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
First I set up a shop in my own garden,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
My mother thought that this was not very proper,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Laughter)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
a pottery factory, a large one.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I said, I also have a pottery.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that the industrial revolution had broken out,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and that I rather should join the factory.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The director there said there were several women casting

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I remember that it was quite successful.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
concerned himself much more with the art department --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that means, with my work -- than making toilets,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And I got several answers, and I accepted the one

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And that was in Hamburg.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
where everything was done on the wheel,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and therefore he brought bread and butter every day,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
which I had to eat out of courtesy.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
The first day I came to work in this shop

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
there was on my wheel a surprise for me.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:30.000
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
(Laughter)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This was my first job.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
(Laughter)

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Applause)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So I will try speed it up a little

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
(Laughter)

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Laughter)

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Eva Zeisel: Are you sure?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
EZ: Well, if you are sure,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And actually, my work took me to many countries

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
because I used my work to fill my curiosity.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000
where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I became art director of the china and glass industry,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
This was a very dangerous accusation.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I actually did survive, which was a surprise.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But since I survived and I'm here,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will --

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Weren't you there recently?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and they came to my studio in Rockland County,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
son-in-law and granddaughter,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
which is not a very pleasant and happy view.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:51.000
(Applause)
