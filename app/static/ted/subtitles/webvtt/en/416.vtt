00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and then nod to the person on your left.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, chances are that over the last winter,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you just nodded at would have died.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And most of those losses are because of things we know.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And below, you can see all these out yards,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then they're shipped out to the almonds.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
after I was here, described this not as beehives

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to say that we have been trying to figure out

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what the cause of this is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
this flu was caused by a new virus to us,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of course, there's the implication.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and the question that keeps us up at night,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And we don't have the answer to that yet,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
very strange things that we can't begin to understand.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
beekeepers can replace them very quickly.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the National Guard would be out.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
they can split that colony in two.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and you can introduce that queen.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And in fact, America was the first country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
you know, your three-pound packages of bees.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and so they've been able to cover those losses.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the same number of colonies have existed in the country,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
at about 2.4 million colonies.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
backyard pig farmer.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you get all of these people in the same room,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and they're all engaged and they're getting along,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they're all there because of the passion for bees.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Now, there's another part of that community

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which are the commercial beekeepers,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I mean, there may be 100 explanations

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He's the one who first identified this condition

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and raised the alarm bells.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And he has a history of these trucks,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And you can do that one year in a row,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
you may be able to do it two years in a row.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
about losing this segment of our industry.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And that's important for many fronts,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
You know, they pick up their hives;

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
they move their families once or twice in a year.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
into the almond groves.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
They all have their breakfast

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because that's quite essential American experience.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And they're not people who like to ask for help,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
although they are the most helpful people ever.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to help him replace those lost colonies.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
historic and exciting community to be involved with.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and had we taken out all those ingredients,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
if we had taken out all those ingredients

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we wouldn't have much on our plate.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but clearly our diet would be diminished.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And that's a really great expression, because really,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
they get paid for their services.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
They get paid by pollen and nectar,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of one variety, and then you have another apple tree

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that's a different type of pollen.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And bees are very faithful.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
However, honeybees are a minority.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
with the colonialists.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And there are actually more species of bees

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
than there are mammals and birds combined.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and very intensely in the last three years.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We have bumblebees on the top.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because only the queen is, over winter.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Audience: Bee?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
(Laughter)

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and they lay an egg on it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Well, these bees hang out at that hole,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you know that your environment is healthy,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but we don't understand these native pollinators

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
or all those other parts of our community.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and bats are in trouble too.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
because there's no money to research the bat problems.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
becoming the population of half of this county in three years.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Nature Deficit Disorder.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
we forgot our connection with nature.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And I think if we reconnect to nature,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
we'll be able to have the resources and that interest

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to solve these problems.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I think we have lost our connection,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And so we need to rethink this idea.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
In fact, you know, the White House

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
used to have sheep in front in order to help fund

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
it wouldn't be a bad idea.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
this companion you can have as it matures

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and as it has these different fragrances.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And this is a companion,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and this is a relationship that never dries up.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And I encourage you to look at that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Now, not all of us have meadows,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
grow a meadow in a pot.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
but a pot in a meadow.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But you can also have this great community of city

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And everyone should open a beehive,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I think this is a great way of doing it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Get a beehive and grow a meadow,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and watch that life come back into your life.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And I hope that you experience it

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and I hope you tell me about it one day.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So thank you very much for being here. 
Thank you very much.
