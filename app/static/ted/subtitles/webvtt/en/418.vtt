00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is an example of a real meteorite,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you can see all the melting of the iron

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and just how much of it survives and melts.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
From a meteorite from space,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we’re over here with an original Sputnik.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is not a copy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The space age began 50 years ago in October,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
without seeing a flag that was carried

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The astronauts each got to carry

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
about ten silk flags in their personal kits.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They would bring them back and mount them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this has actually been carried to the moon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and back.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So that’s for fun.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The dawn of books is, of course, important.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in 1455.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is not the book.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You see, the book was not driven by reading.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In 1455, nobody could read.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So why did the printing press succeed?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
using movable type in the history of man,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
550 years ago.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We are living at the age here at the end of the book,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It turns out that in the 1450s,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the Catholic Church needed money,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and so they

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They traveled all around Europe

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They got you out of purgatory faster.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And when the printing press was invented

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what they found was they could print indulgences,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which was the equivalent of printing money.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to print out thousands,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and then hundreds of thousands,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and then ultimately millions

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of single, small pieces of paper

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
That is why the printing press succeeded,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and that is why Martin Luther

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
nailed his 90 theses to the door:

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in printing out indulgences and selling them

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and had nothing to do with reading.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for those of you that have asked for pictures.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We’re going to have some tomorrow.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Applause)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Instead of showing an object from the stage

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I’m going to do something special for the first time.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You’re going to find out why in a minute,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
because when I went to see Eileen,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
this is what I said I wanted to build.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is the Library of Human Imagination.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The room itself is three stories tall.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that are computer controlled.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It’s designed like an Escher print.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Here is some of the lower level of the library,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
where the exhibits constantly change.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You can walk through. You can touch.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There’s my very own Saturn V.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So you can see here in the lower level of the library

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the books and the objects.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
There is a glass bridge that you walk across

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that’s suspended in space.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So it’s a leap of imagination.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
How do we create?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Part of the question that I have answered is,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
with human achievement, with history,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
with the things that drive us and make us human --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the maps of space that we’ve experienced,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
one or two more objects from the stage,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but for today I just wanted to say thank you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
for all the people that came and talked to us about it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and share it with the TED community.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Applause)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
TED is all about patterns in the clouds.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It’s all about connections.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It’s all about seeing things

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that everybody else has seen before

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
For example, we can look

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
at a DNA molecule model here.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
None of us really have ever seen one,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but we know it exists because we’ve been taught

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to understand this molecule.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But we can also look at an Enigma machine

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
from the Nazis in World War II

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that was a coding and decoding machine.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, this is the code for life,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and this is a code for death.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
These two molecules

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
code and decode.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But once you’ve seen them in a new way,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you realize that both of these things really are connected.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You see, this is a human brain model, OK?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We get to see a skull. But there it is.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
All of imagination -- everything that we think,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And once we create new patterns in this brain,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
once we shape the brain in a new way,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it never returns to its original shape.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I’ll give you a quick example.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We think about the Internet;

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we think about information that goes across the Internet.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And we never think about the hidden connection.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But I brought along here a lump of coal --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
right here, one lump of coal.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to move one megabyte of information across the net.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So every time you download a file,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
each megabyte is a lump of coal.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
looks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So the next time you download a gigabyte,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and to make everything we think possible, possible.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Thanks, Chris.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Applause)
