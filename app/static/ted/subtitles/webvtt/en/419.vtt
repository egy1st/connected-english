WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm just going to play a brief video clip.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Video:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The buyer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
was Kip Forbes,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
ChÃ¢teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the prince of any wine cellar.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that he had made this incredible discovery.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
he would not reveal
exactly where the building was

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.


00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and he became suspicious.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But for those 20 years,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
not only on wine but on lots of things,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and are they living a better life than me?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 



00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in about a dozen categories,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which was a very grueling quest, 
as you can imagine.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was the first one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It may come from Wagyu cattle,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it arrived, and it was tiny. 



00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I was outraged.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It was like, 160 dollars for this?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And then I took a bite,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I almost couldn't finish it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I was really happy when I was done.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now, the photographer who took the pictures for this project

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that I did not think that one was really worth the price.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
White truffles. 


00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in Manhattan -- Del Posto.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
"Would Signore like the truffles?"

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It's in the smell.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
10 seconds passed and it was gone.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
you know, their purpose had been served,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah.



00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
(Laughter)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They did give me a tour, though.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It has 360-degree views.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It has four balconies.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which have antibacterial properties.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but I have to say that nobody here

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you, 



00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I have not gotten a compliment from anybody 


00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in the months that I have owned and worn these.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
should be the test of something's value,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that's a reasonable benchmark.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That said, a lot of work goes into these.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that has been shuttle loomed

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But no compliments.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Laughter)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Thank you.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
so you can go online and look at your batch number

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and see how the phenolics are developing,


00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and, you know, gauge its freshness.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It was very green, it was very peppery.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
for six months.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
(Laughter)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
you'll start to notice.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
but I did interview a guy who owns them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You're paying for the bling,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Oh, yeah, you know this one?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's a cat that lives in trees,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. 



00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in the unprocessed form.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
That's right. 


00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Unrelatedly --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(Laughter)


00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
(Laughter)

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
There's one with a fragrance dispenser.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and transmits the results via email to your doctor.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It's almost like a home medical center -- 


00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This one does not have those bells and whistles,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The seat is preheated. 


00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's a water jet that cleans you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
There's an air jet that dries you.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You get up, it flushes by itself.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The lid closes, it self-cleans.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Not only is it a technological leap forward,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And I want to get one of these.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
(Laughter)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
each buyer gets their name engraved on it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Laughter)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. 


00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Lights glaring in off the street, 


00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And you spend a third of your life in bed.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
(Laughter)

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This was a fun one.


00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and the most expensive production car. 



00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a professional race car driver,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And it was really amazing.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It was such a smooth ride.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
because it was just that smooth.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When he tries to open the door, 



00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There was one object that I could not get my hands on,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc. 



00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And 1947 was a legendary vintage,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But it's 60 years old.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
There's not much of it left.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Not that many people are looking to pop open

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
their one remaining bottle for a journalist.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and it was coming up empty.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And it was going to be a double vertical --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and 30 vintages of Yquem.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.


00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I went.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It was three days, four meals. 


00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And you know, it had this fragrant softness,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And then I tasted it, and it,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
which is characteristic of that wine --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
There were some people who were a little less impressed.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And I wasn't that impressed.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And it wasn't just to that wine.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Any one of the wines served at this tasting,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But drinking 60 great wines over three days,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
they all just blurred together,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and it became almost a grueling experience.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And they gave subjects the same wine,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
labeled with different price tags.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
A lot of people, you know,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
said that they liked the more expensive wine more --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
that was more expensive.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Thank you.
