00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We all make decisions every day; we want to know

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
exactly the right thing at all possible times,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that would be a tremendous gift.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I also want to explain to you why it is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The expected value of any of our actions --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the product of two simple things:

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the value of that gain to us.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we will always know precisely how we should behave.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that multiplies to five, and that's more

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what the right thing is to do, and those are

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, let me talk about the first one first.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or of flipping a heads.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I should say, lose more -- gambling

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The way people figure odds

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
observed in any particular day in Oxford.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you quickly reviewed in memory the times

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then dogs on leashes are more probable.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Are there more four-letter English words

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with R in the third place or R in the first place?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with R in the third than the first place.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's like the dictionary;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, this is an example of how this idea that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the quickness with which things come to mind

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
can give you a sense of their probability --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
these are estimates of number of deaths per year

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
per 200 million U.S. citizens.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Compare these to the actual numbers.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Two things are vastly underestimated:

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's not interesting because it's so common.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
we vastly underestimate them.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
of all three of the others that you see on the slide.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
of people's ability to compute probabilities.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
by investing your money in a lottery ticket

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
with everybody who lost?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Indeed, if we required that television stations run

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
a 30-second interview with each loser

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
of your undivided attention just to watch them say,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery:

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
imagine that the nine tickets are all owned

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
by one fat guy named Leroy.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
changes your decision to play,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
compared to trying to estimate value:

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
how much pleasure it will give us.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I want to talk now about errors in value.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
you wouldn't pay that for it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
What else can I do with 25 dollars?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and realized that they're not going to serve you any food,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
is wafting over the seat, you think,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
before I'd even told you anything about the context?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And this is a systematic error people make.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
For example, this is, of course,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is to say something used to be higher,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
When people are asked about these two different jobs:

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
they're all told they make much less money. Why?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
in the declining period. Here's another nice example.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
so you decide to mull it over for a week.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
for something that was 700 last week.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This tendency to compare to the past

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Here's another example of how comparing to the past

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
can befuddle our decisions.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Imagine that you're going to the theater.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You're on your way to the theater.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You also have a 20-dollar bill.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
When you arrive at the theater,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Most people answer, no.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You're on your way to the theater,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now, just in case you're not getting it,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Laughter)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Along the way, you lost something.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
What the hell difference should it make?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in people's attempts to assign value.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the things we know about comparison:

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
didn't seem like such a great guy.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Laughter)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and they use this wisdom to help you --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
spare you the undue burden of money.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Most people don't want the most expensive,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
they don't want the least expensive.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So I'm telling you something you already knew:

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Here's why that's a problem:

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
our attempts to make rational decisions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Let me just give you an example.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the simplest of all questions:

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Namely, those who are looking at Spam

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty;

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
those who are looking at Godiva chocolate

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
think they won't be nearly so tasty.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
what's sitting in the corner of the room

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
that then does not carry through and change their experience.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You want to buy a car stereo.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Most people say they would.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
doesn't know where it came from.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It doesn't know what you saved it on.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
to the purchase that you're making,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
You've all had this experience.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And at some point you may have met a couple

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
from your own hometown, and you thought,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and what do you find?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Compared to your regular friends,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the big ones sound a little better.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And so you buy them, and you bring them home,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
and you entirely violate the décor of your house.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
is a comparison you'll never make again.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
which you can't even remember hearing.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
when these choices are arrayed over time.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
People have a lot of trouble making decisions

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
about things that will happen at different points in time.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
is that by and large people use two simple rules.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and then a third, hard, problem.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Here's the first easy problem:

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
we believe more is better than less.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Here's the second problem:

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Again, an easy decision,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
because we all know that now is better than later.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
by waiting, but you have to be patient.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
or 60 dollars in 13 months.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
What do we find now?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
they might as well wait 13.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
off into the future a year.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
These guys can tell us.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
What you see here are two lads,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and I want you to notice two things.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Here are the results of what I just showed you.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
This is the subjective height --

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
the height you saw of these guys at various points.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
And I want you to see that two things are true.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
but at a far distance

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
their normal, their true, relations are preserved.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
60 now or 50 in a month?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And these are subjective values,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
People always think more is better than less:

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
60 is always better than 50,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
and they always think now is better than later:

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Watch what happens when we drop some out.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
when people get to the future, they will change their minds.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I'll take the 50 dollars now.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this:

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
than the one in which we are living.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
They were evolved for a world

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
in which people lived in very small groups,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
had rather short lives in which there were few choices

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
We are the only species on this planet

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
that has ever held its own fate in its hands.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
We have no significant predators,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
we're the masters of our physical environment;

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
the things that normally cause species to become extinct

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
are no longer any threat to us.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
are our own decisions.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
by a young Dutch fellow in 1738,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Thank you.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:45.000
(Applause)

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and is there some way that we could counteract that?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
We already know, for example, in the United States,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
because they were scared -- and driving on highways,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
than were killed in 9/11. OK?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
If I told you that there was a plague

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
whether they should get the kind of play,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the kind of coverage, that they do.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
that they'll be hurt in these various ways,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Talk more about it.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
If Australia disappears tomorrow,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
terror is probably the right response.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
more people than that were killed

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
by not using their seatbelts in the same country.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Is terror the right response?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
that it's so spectacular?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
What is it?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
it's not a tree falling on us by accident.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
So there are a number of things that together

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
who want these things to be

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
as spectacular as they possibly can.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
go to Israel. And a mall blows up,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
and the wedding that was planned was still going on.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And as the Israeli mother said,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I mean, this is a society that has learned --

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
and there are others too -- that has learned to live

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
CA: But is there a rational fear that actually,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
the Big One is to come?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
we would probably not be nearly so frightened.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
That's not my point at all.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
our distress about things that happen, about threats,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and threats to come.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
how many people do you know got up and said,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
There are no guns going off.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
(Laughter)

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
(Applause)

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
That's a tough one.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
CA: There's no question.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
unless someone can show that there's, you know,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
The latest I've read, seen, thought

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
but with poverty it's a bit --

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
CA: We've evolved to get all excited

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
and systems that cause poverty and so forth,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
into worrying about those things?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
People died; so be it.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And so we evolved these responses.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Is that what happened?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
an evolutionary explanation, you might say

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
of stuff that's new and different.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And there's a good reason to be,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
our general tendency is to orient towards

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
that which is new and novel is activated.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
which is the error of value.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I know, because I've interviewed

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
That's what you think it is. All right?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
until the drawing indicates you've lost.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Now, economists tend to --

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
(Applause)

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
-- economists tend to view the world

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
through their own lenses, which is:

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
this is just a bunch of stupid people.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
(Applause)

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
even though they don't feel great during the drawing.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
But certainly I see your point: that there can be

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
CA: Last question.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
as we'll all hear tomorrow.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I very much resonate with what you're saying,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
because it seems to me that the problem

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
(Laughter)

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
DG: For you or for them?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
AdG: In persuading them.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
and the near future is that we imagine the near future

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
much more vividly than the far future.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
that people put into the mental representations

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
of near and far future, people begin to make decisions

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
about the two in the same way.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
is a question that's very different than,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
what will you look like, how much hair will you have,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
who will you be living with.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
so that that guy has a little retirement money.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
But these are tricks around the margins.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
which is to say, "I'm here today,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
and so now is more important than later."

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
(Applause)
