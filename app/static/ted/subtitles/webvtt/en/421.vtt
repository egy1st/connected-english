00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The career that I started early on in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and high deserts and low deserts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and contain unbelievable biological wonders

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Apart from the intrinsic value

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we're also using these as templates

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for figuring out how to go look

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for life on other planets.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Particularly Mars, but also Europa,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the small, icy moon around Jupiter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm very passionately interested in the human future,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
on the Moon and Mars particularly,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and elsewhere in the solar system.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I think it's time that we transitioned

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to a solar system-going civilization and species.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Notably Mars, as a first example.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is how I actually got to this state

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and why I do the work that I do.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Because in the mid-1950s,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when I was a tiny child,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
they had the audacity to launch

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And a tremendous amount of money

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
went into the funding of science

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and mathematics skills for kids.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And I'm a product of that generation,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
like so many other of my peers.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Of course, refusing to grow up --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
-- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but I do a fairly good job of that --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but really retaining that childlike quality

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of not caring what other people think

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
about what you're interested in, is really critical.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The next element is the fact that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I have applied a value judgment

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and my value judgment is that the presence of life

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is better than no life.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And so, life is more valuable than no life.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And so I think that that holds together

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
a great deal of the work

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that people in this audience approach.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm very interested in Mars, of course,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And that took what had been

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
a tiny little astronomical object in the sky,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that you would see as a dot,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and turned it completely into a landscape,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
as that very first primitive picture

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
came rastering across the screen.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And when it became a landscape,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it also became a destination,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and altered, really, the course of my life.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
In my graduate years I worked with

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
working on global change issues.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We've written a number of things on

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the role of Gaia hypothesis --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in any meaningful scientific sense,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then, as an outgrowth of that,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, wonderful things and grim things.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
with external eyes, not just as our home.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to try to then think about the way

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
our planet behaves, as a planet,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and with the life that's on it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And all of this seems to me to be

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
a salient point in history.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We're getting ready to begin to go

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
through the process of leaving our planet of origin

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and out into the wider solar system and beyond.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So, back to Mars.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
even on this planet.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So, finding life on another planet

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is a non-trivial occupation

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
sort of depends on what you think about

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the chances of life in the universe.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think, myself,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that life is a natural outgrowth

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of the increasing complexification of matter over time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and you get planets forming --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Certainly, in the last 15 years,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
we've seen increasing numbers of planets

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
outside of our solar system being confirmed,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and just last month, a couple of weeks ago,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a planet in the size-class of Earth

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
has actually been found.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And so this is very exciting news.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So, my first bold prediction is that,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It's going to be everywhere we look --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So, what about life on Mars?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I would've probably said, a couple of percent.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I was once sneeringly introduced

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
by a former NASA official,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
as the only person on the planet

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
who still thought there was life on Mars.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so there's a certain amount of glory

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in outliving your adversaries.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But things have changed greatly

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
over the last dozen years.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And the reason that they have changed

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is because we now have new information.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and the MER Rover missions

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that are on Mars as we speak now

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and the European Space Agency's Mars Express,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
has taught us a number of amazing things.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And so where there is water,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
there is a very high chance of our kind of life.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place –

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and there are these amazing structures called blueberries,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which are these little, rocky concretions

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that we are busy making biologically

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in my lab right now.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So, with all of these things put together,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I think that the chances of life

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
are much greater than I would've ever thought.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So this is a very bold statement.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I think it's there, and I think we need

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to go look for it, and I think it's underground.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
How do you plan to look for it?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
How do you know it when you find it?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Very critically, how do we protect it,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
if we find it, and not contaminate it?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And also, even perhaps more critically, because

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
this is the only home planet we have,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
how do we protect us from it, while we study it?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So why might it be hard to find?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to study microscopic things,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
although the amazing tools that we now have to do that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
allow us to study things in much greater depth,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
at much smaller scales than ever before.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And so, there's a game of predator-prey

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that's going to be, essentially, universal, really,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in any kind of biological system.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties –

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
its chemistry, or its size.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We say small, but what does that mean?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And speed of activity, which is something that we face

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in our work with sub-surface organisms,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because they grow very, very slowly.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
If I were to take a swab off your teeth

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and plate it on a Petri plate,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
But the organisms that we work with,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
from the sub-surface of Earth,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
very often it's months -- and in many cases, years --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
before we see any growth whatsoever.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But the real issue is that we are guided by

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
our limited experience,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
then we can't recognize what to look for,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
or how to plan for it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So, perspective is everything

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I have learned to think about Earth

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
as an extraterrestrial planet.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is my favorite game on airplanes:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
where you're in an airplane and you look out the window,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
you see the horizon.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I always turn my head on the side,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and that simple change makes me go from

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
seeing this planet as home,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to seeing it as a planet.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
when I'm sitting in a window seat.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Well, this is what we apply to our work.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
coming into this cave from volcanic sources

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and from the breakdown of evaporite --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and it is a completely hostile environment for us.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
This is regularly several hundred parts per million.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So, it's a very hazardous environment,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
with CO as well, and many other gases.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
These extreme physical and chemical parameters

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
make the biology that grows in these places very special.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This is one of the richest caves

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that we have found on the planet, anywhere.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's bursting with life.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but one of the reasons that we're interested in them

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
is because they represent, really,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, this is part of the ability that we have,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to try to stretch our imagination,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
in terms of what we may find in the future.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
There's so much life in this cave,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and I can't even begin

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to scratch the surface of it with you.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But one of the most famous objects out of this

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
making more sulfuric acid,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and living at pHs right around zero.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
In fact, there's so much energy available

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
for biology in this cave,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And the local Zoque Indians

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
harvest this twice a year,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This is very unusual for caves.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's 115 miles of mapped passage,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
it's pristine, it has no natural opening

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and it's a gigantic biological,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
geo-microbiological laboratory.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In this cave, great areas are covered by

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
this reddish material that you see here,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and also these enormous crystals

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of selenite that you can see dangling down.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
This stuff is produced biologically.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that organisms are busy munching their way through.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
They take iron and manganese minerals

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
within the bedrock and they oxidize them.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
to run their life processes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Interestingly enough, they also do this

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And so, the obvious avenue

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
for bio-remediation

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
comes from organisms like this.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
These organisms we now bring into the lab,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that we find on the walls of these caves.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
which are a by-product of volcanic activity,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
we find these walls totally covered,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in many cases,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
by these beautiful, glistening silver walls,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And these are mineral deposits

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that are also made by bacteria.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And you can see in these central images here,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
these are gardens of these bacteria.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
One of the interesting things about these particular guys

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
is that they're in the actinomycete

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and streptomycete groups of the bacteria,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which is where we get most of our antibiotics.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
The sub-surface of Earth

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
contains a vast biodiversity.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And these organisms,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because they're very separate from the surface,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
make a vast array of novel compounds.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And so, the potential for exploiting this

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
is completely untapped,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
but probably exceeds most of the rest

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
of the biodiversity of the planet.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, lava-tube caves--

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We know that on Mars and the Moon

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
there are tons of these structures.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We can see them.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
On the left you can see a lava tube forming

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and this is the way these tubes form.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And when they hollow out,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
then they become habitats for organisms.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
These are all over the planet Mars,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and we're busy cataloguing them now.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
on Mars, at least of that type.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In order to access

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
these sub-surface environments that we're interested in,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It requires crawling, climbing,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
rope-work, technical rope-work

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and many other complex human motions

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
in order to access these.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Why would we want to do it robotically?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Well, we're going to be sending

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
robotic missions to Mars

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
long in advance of human missions.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
about the preciousness of any life that we may find

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
is to have an intermediary.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And in this case, we're imagining

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
intermediary robotic devices

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that can actually do some of that

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
front-end work for us,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
to protect any potential life that we find.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I'm not going to go through all of these projects now,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
in collaboration with a number of different groups.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I want to talk specifically about the

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
array that you see on the top.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
These are hopping microbot swarms.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and we have come up with the idea

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
of having little, jumping bean-like

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
robots

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that are propelled by artificial muscle,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And these allow them to hop.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
They behave with

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
a swarm behavior,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
where they relate to each other,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
modeled after insect swarm behavior,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and they could be made very numerous.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And so, one can send a thousand of them,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
as you can see in this upper left-hand picture,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
If you send a thousand of them,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And so, that allows you the flexibility

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
to go into very challenging terrain

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and actually make your way where you want to go.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
It occurred to us a number of years ago

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that caves have many properties

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that people have used

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
looking at the irreducible set of technologies

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
that you would need in order to

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
on the Moon or Mars.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and we have gone

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
in the relatively primitive technology direction.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
that can conform to the complex topological shape

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
on the inside of a cave,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
various ways of getting breathing gases

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And the future is there for us

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
but I think in the future we'll be using them

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
for habitat and science on these other bodies.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Now, my view of what the current status

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
of potential life on Mars is

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that it's probably been on the planet,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
maybe one in two chances.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
The question as to whether

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
has now been very muddied,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
because we now know,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
One of the burning questions, of course, is

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
if we go there and find life in the sub-surface,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
as I fully expect that we will,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
is that a second genesis of life?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Did life start here

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and was it transported there?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Did it start there and get transported here?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and where I expect that we will

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Thank you.
