00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We like to dance together, we like singing together.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with a first experiment today. The experiment is --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that you did it in a typical North American way,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that is, you were raucous and incoherent.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
can you get it together to clap in sync?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(Clapping)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Whoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's interesting.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some trained musicians out there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Is that what enabled you to synchronize?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So to put the question a little more seriously,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for spontaneous synchronization.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But there is a countervailing force in the universe --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
or fish swimming in organized schools.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is from a BBC show called "Predators,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
wondering how it could be possible.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
These creatures are not choreographed.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They're choreographing themselves.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that shows how swarms work.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
There are just three simple rules.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And third, they're all attracted to each other,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but they try to keep a small distance apart.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And when you build those three rules in,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
automatically you start to see swarms

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The prey move out in random directions,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
so there's this constant splitting and reforming.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And you see that in nature.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
That is, out of the desire to save itself,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
each creature is following these rules,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
so you can think of several.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
As I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
are reduced as compared to a small group.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
There are many eyes to spot danger.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that actually waves of panic can propagate,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
sending messages over great distances.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You'll see -- let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Information can be sent over half a kilometer away

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in a very short time through this mechanism.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yes, it's happening here.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
from that computer model, what's going on.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
As I say, it's just those three simple rules,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
plus the one about watch out for predators.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
How do the rules give rise to the patterns?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There is one case that we have begun to understand better,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and it's the case of fireflies.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
If you see fireflies in North America,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
like so many North American sorts of things,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
paying no attention to their neighbors.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
You can see it every night along the river banks.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Specifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
(Music)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Then on, and then off -- a 30th of a second, there.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
On, more on and then off.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
For a long time it was not believed

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
No one believed them.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And for a long time, even after it was documented,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to see patterns where there are none.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that they really were very well synchronized.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
to see this kind of spontaneous order,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and I've already hinted that the answer is no.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You can even be just a single cell.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
They're keeping you alive.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down --

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
for the pacemaker to work correctly.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
discharging in pathological concert.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that would be a case of atomic synchrony.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is that this light is incoherent --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
many different colors and different frequencies,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
sort of like the way you clapped initially --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
emitting light of one color, one frequency.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now comes the very risky part of my talk,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Hold your breath for me.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
What I have here are two empty water bottles.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I have some metronomes here.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Can you hear that?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
All right, so, I've got a metronome,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
another one set to the same setting.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Right? They did.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And the reason is that they're not able to communicate.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
How can metronomes communicate?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I'm going to put them on a movable platform,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.000
which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Let's see if we can get this to work.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Applause)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
All right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
(Laughter)

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
sometimes has unexpected consequences.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And a clear case of that,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
was something that happened in London in the year 2000.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
first river crossing in over 100 years in London.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and then scamper across on this blade of light.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I want a blade of light across the Thames."

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So they built the blade of light,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
with cables that are out on the side.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
These cables were on the side of the bridge,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that's what's holding up this bridge.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So I want to first show you some interviews with people

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
rather like being on the boat.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Boy: It was about --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Boy: About the second one.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Man: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Woman: I remember wanting to get off.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Interviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
because if you didn't keep your balance,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
oh, and short steps?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Man: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
that it was probably the number of people on it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Interviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Steven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Think of the people as being like metronomes.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
They all showed this strange sort of skating gait

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
that they adopted once the bridge started to move.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
who figured out what happened on the bridge,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that engineers knew nothing about.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Actually, I think the first person you'll see

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Narrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
apparently rocking from side to side in unison,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
not only with each other, but with the bridge.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
But how could the crowd become synchronized?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
This was to be the focus of the investigation.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
in the same way as the real bridge --

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
AM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Interviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.


00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,


00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Interviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
as our witnesses walked on the real bridge.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Their instructions: just walk normally.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
They're all having some difficulty walking.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
and therefore to drive it to move further.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
(Applause)
