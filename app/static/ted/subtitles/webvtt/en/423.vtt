00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"What is your most precious natural resource?" --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they will not say children at first.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And then when you say children,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
they will pretty quickly agree with you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Video): We're traveling today with

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the Minister of Defense of Colombia,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
head of the army and the head of the police,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we're dropping off 650 laptops

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
today to children

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who have no television, no telephone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and have been in a community

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
cut off from the rest of the world

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for the past 40 years. 


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The importance of delivering laptops to this region

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because of the FARC,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
as a political movement and then became a drug movement.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are one billion children in the world,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and 50 percent of them don't have electricity

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
at home or at school.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I don't mean that they drop out of school

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So in the three years

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's gone from an idea

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to a real laptop.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have half a million laptops today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in the hands of children.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We have about a quarter of a million in transit

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to those and other children,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and then there are another quarter of a million more

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that are being ordered at this moment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's smaller than I predicted --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I predicted three to 10 million --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but is still a very large number.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
a strategic defense issue

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in the sense of liberating these zones

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that had been completely closed off,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in which the people who had been causing, if you will,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and assassinations lived.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And suddenly,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the kids have connected laptops.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They've leapfrogged.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The change is absolutely monumental,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because it's not just opening it up,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
yes, there will be television.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But the kids six to 12 years old

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so the children grow up

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
with access to information,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with a window into the rest of the world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Before, they were closed off.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Interestingly enough, in other countries,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as an engine of economic growth.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but it's an important, deeply economic

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and cultural change

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that happens through children.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Thirty-one countries in total are involved,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and in the case of Uruguay,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
half the children already have them,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and by the middle of 2009,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a little green laptop.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now what are some of the results?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Some of the results

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that go across every single country

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
include teachers saying

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
they have never loved teaching so much,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and reading comprehension

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Probably the most important thing we see

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is children teaching parents.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
They own the laptops. They take them home.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And so when I met with three children from the schools,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
one of the three children brought her mother.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And the reason she brought her mother

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is that this six-year-old child

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
had been teaching her mother

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
how to read and write.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Her mother had not gone to primary school.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And this is such an inversion,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and such a wonderful example

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
of children being the agents of change.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So now, in closing, people say,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
now why laptops?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The reason you want laptops

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is that the word is education, not laptop.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is an education project, not a laptop project.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They need to learn learning. And then, just think --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
they can have, let's say, 100 books.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In a village, you have 100 laptops,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
each with a different set of 100 books,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Sometimes school is under a tree,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so you need a collaborative model of learning,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
not just building more schools and training more teachers,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which you have to do anyway.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and it generated over 100,000 laptops

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that we were then able to give free.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And by being a zero-dollar laptop,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ethiopia, Mongolia.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Places that are not markets,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
seeding it with the principles of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So think of it this way:

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
think of it as inoculating children

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
against ignorance.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You don't vaccinate a few children.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You vaccinate all the children in an area.
