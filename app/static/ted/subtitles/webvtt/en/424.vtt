00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:02.976
There are more Chinese
restaurants in this country

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.976
than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.637
40,000, actually.

00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.989
Chinese restaurants have played
an important role in American history,

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:13.192
as a matter of fact.

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:16.077
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved
in a Chinese restaurant

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:18.109
called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.767
which unfortunately is closed now,

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.656
and about to be turned into Walgreen's.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.491
And the house where John Wilkes Booth

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.793
planned the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.936
is also now a Chinese restaurant
called Wok and Roll,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.199
on H Street in Washington.

00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:33.483
(Laughter)

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.178
And it's not completely gratuitous,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.179
because "wok" and "roll" --
Chinese food and Japanese foods,

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:39.368
so it kind of works out.

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:41.614
And Americans love
their Chinese food so much,

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:43.573
they've actually brought it into space.

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:47.208
NASA, for example, serves
thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.384
on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.746
So, let me present the question to you:

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.394
If our benchmark
for Americanness is apple pie,

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:58.055
you should ask yourself:
how often do you eat apple pie,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.055
versus how often do you eat Chinese food?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.471
And if you think about it,

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:12.447
a lot of the foods that we or Americans
think of as Chinese food

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.606
are barely recognizable to Chinese.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.669
For example: beef with broccoli,
egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.749
fortune cookies, chop suey,
the take-out boxes.

00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:24.921
For example, I took a whole bunch
of fortune cookies back to China,

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.373
gave them to Chinese
to see how they would react.

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:28.664
[What is this?]

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.072
[Should I try it?]

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:31.856
[Try it!]

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:35.896
[What is this called?]

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.641
[Fortune cookie.]

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.363
(Laughter)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.875
[There's a piece of paper inside!]

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.899
(Laughter)

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.570
[What is this?]

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:53.981
[You've won a prize!]

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:58.105
[What is this?]

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.088
[It's a fortune!]

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.733
[Tasty!]

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.161
So where are they from?

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.786
The short answer is, actually,
they're from Japan.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:14.146
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still
small family-run bakeries

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.506
that make fortune cookies,
as they did over 100 years ago,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.680
30 years before fortune cookies
were introduced in the United States.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:23.327
If you see them side by side,

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.630
there's yellow and brown.

00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:27.344
Theirs are actually flavored
with miso and sesame paste,

00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:29.383
so they're not as sweet as our version.

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:31.000
So how did they get to the US?

00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:33.976
Well, the short answer is,
the Japanese immigrants came over,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.458
and a bunch of the bakers
introduced them --

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.458
including at least one in Los Angeles,

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:40.975
and one here in San Francisco,
called Benkyodo,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.145
which is on the corner
of Sutter and Buchanan.

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.976
Back then, they made fortune cookies
using very much the similar kind of irons

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.749
that we saw back in Kyoto.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.162
The interesting question is:

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:54.597
How do you go from fortune cookies
being something that is Japanese

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:56.344
to being something that is Chinese?

00:02:56.368 --> 00:02:59.491
Well, we locked up all the Japanese
during World War II,

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:01.584
including those that made fortune cookies.

00:03:01.608 --> 00:03:03.411
So that's when the Chinese moved in,

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:05.371
saw a market opportunity and took over.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:07.021
(Laughter)

00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:09.407
So, fortune cookies:
invented by the Japanese,

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.742
popularized by the Chinese,

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:12.595
but ultimately consumed by Americans.

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.579
They're more American than anything else.

00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:16.044
Another of my favorite dishes:

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.225
General Tso's Chicken --
which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.777
is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.807
(Laughter)

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:22.983
I love this dish.

00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:26.068
The original name of my book
was "The Long March of General Tso."

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:27.779
And he has marched very far indeed,

00:03:27.803 --> 00:03:30.846
because he is sweet, he is fried,
and he is chicken --

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.628
all things that Americans love.

00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:34.311
(Laughter)

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:35.879
He has marched so far, actually,

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:38.068
that the chef who originally
invented the dish

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.235
doesn't recognize it;
he's kind of horrified.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:42.933
Video: (In Chinese)

00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:51.395
Audience: (Laughter)

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.976
He's in Taiwan right now.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.421
He's retired, deaf
and plays a lot of mah–jongg.

00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:58.714
After I showed him this, he got up,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.731
and says, "mòmíngqímiào,"
which means, "This is all nonsense,"

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:04.706
and goes back to play his mah-jongg
game during the afternoon.

00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:08.710
Another dish, one of my favorites:
beef with broccoli.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:11.896
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.641
in fact, it is originally
an Italian vegetable.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:17.640
It was introduced into
the United States in the 1800s,

00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:20.541
but became popularized
in the 1920s and the 1930s.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:24.014
The Chinese have their own version
of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,

00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:26.457
but they've now discovered
American broccoli,

00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:30.366
and are importing it
as a sort of exotic delicacy.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.479
I guarantee you, General Tso
never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.

00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:36.706
That was a picture of General Tso.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.976
I went to his home town.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.453
This is a billboard that says:

00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:41.493
"Welcome to the birthplace
of General Tso."

00:04:41.517 --> 00:04:43.712
And I went looking for chicken.

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:45.182
Finally found a cow --

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:47.952
and did find chicken.

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.936
Believe it or not, these guys
were actually crossing the road.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.924
(Laughter)

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.092
And I found a whole bunch
of General Tso's relatives

00:04:57.116 --> 00:04:58.401
who are still in the town.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.188
This guy is now five generations
removed from the General;

00:05:01.212 --> 00:05:02.418
this guy is about seven.

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:05.268
I showed them the pictures
of General Tso Chicken,

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:06.462
and they were like,

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.749
"We don't know this dish.
Is this Chinese food?"

00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:11.200
Because it doesn't look
like Chinese food to them.

00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:15.480
But they weren't surprised I traveled
around the world to visit them,

00:05:15.504 --> 00:05:17.718
because in their eyes he is, after all,

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:19.482
a famous Qing dynasty military hero.

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.000
He played an important role
in the Taiping Rebellion,

00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:24.648
a war started by a guy
who thought he was the son of God

00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.262
and baby brother of Jesus Christ.

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:28.576
He caused a war that killed
20 million people --

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.853
still the deadliest civil war
in the world to this day.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.894
So, you know, I realized when I was there,

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.895
General Tso is kind of a lot
like Colonel Sanders in America,

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.447
in that he's known
for chicken and not war.

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:43.963
But in China, this guy's actually known
for war and not chicken.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:47.128
But the granddaddy
of all the Chinese American dishes

00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:50.072
we probably ought to talk
about is chop suey,

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:53.214
which was introduced
around the turn of the 20th century.

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:55.866
According to the New York Times in 1904,

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.753
there was an outbreak
of Chinese restaurants all over town,

00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:01.696
and "... the city has gone
'chop suey' mad."

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.413
So it took about 30 years
before the Americans realized

00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:07.976
that chop suey is actually
not known in China,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.917
and as this article points out,

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:14.528
"The average native of any city in China
knows nothing of chop suey."

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.937
Back then it was a way to show
you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.632
a guy who wanted to impress a girl
could take her on a chop suey date.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.109
I like to say chop suey
is the biggest culinary joke

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.820
one culture ever played on another,

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.963
because "chop suey,"
translated into Chinese,

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:31.103
means "jaahp-seui," which, translated
back, means "odds and ends."

00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:34.500
So, these people are going
around China asking for chop suey,

00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:37.373
which is sort of like a Japanese guy
coming here and saying,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.141
"I understand you have
a very popular dish in your country

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.469
called 'leftovers.'"

00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:43.705
(Laughter)

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:44.880
Right?

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.056
(Laughter)

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.278
And not only that:

00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:50.945
"This dish is particularly popular

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.061
after that holiday
you call 'Thanksgiving.'"

00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:54.087
(Laughter)

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.193
So, why and where did chop suey come from?

00:06:57.217 --> 00:07:00.414
Let's go back to the mid-1800s,

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:02.350
when the Chinese first came to America.

00:07:02.374 --> 00:07:05.781
Back then, Americans were not
clamoring to eat Chinese food.

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:10.448
In fact, they saw these people
who landed at their shores as alien.

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:13.534
These people weren't eating dogs,
they were eating cats.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.941
If they weren't eating cats,
they were eating rats.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.315
In fact, The New York Times,
my esteemed employer,

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:19.963
in 1883 ran an article that asked,

00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:21.138
"Do Chinese eat rats?"

00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:25.512
Not the most PC question
to be asked today,

00:07:25.536 --> 00:07:27.947
but if you look at the popular
imagery of the time,

00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:29.387
not so outlandish.

00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:34.367
This is actually a real
advertisement for rat poison

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:35.598
from the late 1800s.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.280
And if you see under the word
"Clears" -- very small --

00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:41.090
it says, "They must go,"
which refers not only to the rats,

00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:43.091
but to the Chinese in their midst,

00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:46.168
because the way
that the food was perceived

00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:49.264
was that these people who ate
foods different from us

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:50.542
must be different from us.

00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:53.944
Another way that you saw
this antipathy towards the Chinese

00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:55.457
is through documents like this.

00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.152
This is in the Library of Congress.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.239
It's a pamphlet published
by Samuel Gompers,

00:07:59.263 --> 00:08:01.001
hero of our American labor movement.

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:03.632
It's called, "Some Reason
for Chinese Exclusion:

00:08:03.656 --> 00:08:07.340
Meat versus Rice: American Manhood
against Asiatic Coolieism:

00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:08.515
Which shall survive?"

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:10.316
And it basically made the argument

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.373
that Chinese men who ate rice

00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:14.779
would necessarily bring down
the standard of living

00:08:14.803 --> 00:08:16.588
for American men who ate meat.

00:08:16.612 --> 00:08:18.050
And as a matter of fact, then,

00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:21.174
this is one of the reasons
we must exclude them from this country.

00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:22.976
So, with sentiments like these,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.976
the Chinese Exclusion Act
was passed between 1882 and 1902,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.976
the only time in American history

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.908
when a group was specifically excluded

00:08:32.932 --> 00:08:36.343
for its national origin or ethnicity.

00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:38.760
So in a way, because
the Chinese were attacked,

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:41.933
chop suey was created
as a defense mechanism.

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:43.976
Who came up with the idea of chop suey?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.298
There's a lot of different
mysteries and legends,

00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:47.795
but of the ones I've found,

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.724
the most interesting
is this article from 1904.

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:52.039
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:54.270
shows up in Chinatown,
New York City, and says,

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:56.261
"I want you all to stop making chop suey,

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:59.815
because I am the original creator
and sole proprietor of chop suey.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.220
And the way he tells it,

00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:06.233
there was a famous Chinese
diplomat that showed up,

00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:08.868
and he was told to make a dish
that looked very popular

00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:10.630
and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:13.326
And as he said --
we would never print this today --

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.097
but basically, the American man
has become very rich.

00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:20.392
Lem Sen: "I would've made this money, too,
but I spent all this time

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:22.709
looking for the American man
who stole my recipe.

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:24.835
Now I've found him
and I want my recipe back,

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:26.986
and I want everyone
to stop making chop suey,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.883
or pay me for the right to do the same.

00:09:28.907 --> 00:09:32.572
So it was an early exercise
of intellectual property rights.

00:09:32.596 --> 00:09:35.976
The thing is, this idea
of Chinese-American food

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.104
doesn't exist only in America.

00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:42.129
In fact, Chinese food
is the most pervasive food on the planet,

00:09:42.153 --> 00:09:45.128
served on all seven continents,
even Antarctica,

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:48.108
because Monday night is Chinese
food night at McMurdo Station,

00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:51.251
which is the main scientific
station in Antarctica.

00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:53.326
You see different varieties
of Chinese food.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.408
For example, there is French Chinese food,

00:09:55.432 --> 00:09:58.381
where they serve
salt and pepper frog legs.

00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:02.392
There is Italian Chinese food,
where they don't have fortune cookies,

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:03.704
so they serve fried gelato.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:06.502
My neighbor, Alessandra,
was shocked when I told her,

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:08.458
"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:12.488
She's like, "It's not? But they serve it
in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:16.202
(Laughter)

00:10:16.226 --> 00:10:18.042
Even the Brits have their own version.

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:20.317
This is a dish called
"crispy shredded beef,"

00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.517
which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred,
and not a lot of beef.

00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:26.634
There is West Indian Chinese food,
there's Jamaican Chinese food,

00:10:26.658 --> 00:10:29.736
Middle Eastern Chinese food,
Mauritian Chinese food.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.482
This is a dish called "Magic Bowl,"
that I discovered.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.976
There's Indian Chinese food,
Korean Chinese food,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.484
Japanese Chinese food,

00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:40.477
where they take the bao, the little buns,
and make them into pizza versions.

00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:41.616
(Laughter)

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.817
And they totally randomly
take Chinese noodle dishes,

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.049
and just ramenize them.

00:10:46.073 --> 00:10:49.287
This is something that,
in the Chinese version, has no soup.

00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:51.274
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,

00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:53.753
which should not be mixed
with Mexican Chinese food,

00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:56.750
where they basically take things
and make it look like fajitas.

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:57.776
(Laughter)

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.860
And they have things
like risotto chop suey.

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:01.956
My personal favorite
of all the restaurants

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.567
I've encountered around the world

00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.631
was this one in Brazil,
called "Kung Food."

00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:09.266
(Laughter)

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.539
So, let's take a step back and understand

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:15.135
what is to be appreciated in America.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:20.418
McDonald's has garnered
a lot of attention, a lot of respect,

00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:25.992
for basically standardizing the menu,
decor and dining experience

00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.566
in post-World War II America.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.830
But you know what?

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.994
They did so through a centralized
headquarters out of Illinois.

00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:35.230
Chinese restaurants have done largely
the same thing, I would argue,

00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:37.802
with the menu and the decor,
even the restaurant name,

00:11:37.826 --> 00:11:39.693
but without a centralized headquarters.

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:42.058
So, this actually became very clear to me

00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:44.841
with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,

00:11:44.865 --> 00:11:47.976
where they expected, based
on the number of ticket sales they had,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.021
to have three or four
second-place winners,

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.265
people who match
five or six Powerball numbers.

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:54.928
Instead, they had 110,
and they were completely shocked.

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:58.313
They looked all across the country
and discovered it couldn't be fraud,

00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:01.819
since it happened in different states,
across different computer systems.

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:05.208
Whatever it was, it caused people
to behave in a mass-synchronized way.

00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:09.333
So, OK, maybe it had to do
with the patterns on the pieces of paper,

00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:12.263
like it was a diamond, or diagonal.

00:12:12.287 --> 00:12:15.227
It wasn't that, so they're like,
OK, let's look at television.

00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:17.180
So they looked at an episode of "Lost."

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.393
Now, I don't have a TV,

00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:20.619
which makes me a freak,
but very productive --

00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:22.770
(Laughter)

00:12:22.794 --> 00:12:26.687
And there's an episode of "Lost"
where one guy has a lucky number,

00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:29.409
but it's not a lucky number,
it's why he's on the island,

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:31.674
but they looked
and the numbers did not match.

00:12:31.698 --> 00:12:34.896
They looked at "The Young
and The Restless." It wasn't that, either.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.205
It wasn't until the first guy shows up
the next day and they ask him,

00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:39.758
"Where did you get your number?"

00:12:39.782 --> 00:12:41.787
He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:43.631
This is a slip one of the winners had,

00:12:43.655 --> 00:12:45.991
because the Tennessee
lottery security officials

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.936
were like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.123
But it was true.

00:12:49.147 --> 00:12:51.976
Basically, of those 110 people,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.285
104 of them or so had gotten
their number from a fortune cookie.

00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:57.112
(Laughter)

00:12:57.136 --> 00:12:59.978
Yeah. So I went and started looking.

00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:02.622
I went across the country,
looking for these restaurants

00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:05.574
where these people had gotten
their fortune cookies from.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:09.237
There are a bunch of them,
including Lee's China in Omaha --

00:13:09.261 --> 00:13:12.042
which is actually run by Koreans,
but that's another point,

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:14.623
and a bunch of them named "China Buffet."

00:13:14.647 --> 00:13:17.976
What's interesting is that their stories
were similar, but different.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.976
It was lunch, it was take-out,
it was sit-down, it was buffet,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.257
it was three weeks ago,
it was three months ago.

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:26.401
But at some point, all these people
had a very similar experience

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:29.289
that converged at a fortune cookie
and a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:29.313 --> 00:13:31.909
And all these restaurants
were serving fortune cookies,

00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:34.379
which, of course,
aren't even Chinese to begin with.

00:13:34.403 --> 00:13:37.943
It's part of the phenomenon
I called "spontaneous self-organization,"

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:43.815
where, like in ant colonies,
little decisions made on the micro level

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.125
actually have a big impact
on the macro level.

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:50.542
A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.

00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:54.103
McDonald's actually spent 10 years
coming out with a chicken-like product.

00:13:54.127 --> 00:13:58.413
They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken,
and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:02.442
And the great innovation of Chicken
McNuggets was not nuggifying them,

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:03.964
that's kind of an easy concept.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:07.763
The trick was, they were able
to remove the chicken from the bone

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:09.075
in a cost-efficient manner,

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.158
which is why it took so long
for people to copy them -- 10 years,

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:14.378
then within a couple months,
it was such a hit,

00:14:14.402 --> 00:14:17.693
they introduced it across the entire
McDonald's system in the country.

00:14:17.717 --> 00:14:19.483
In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,

00:14:19.507 --> 00:14:22.270
which actually started
in New York City in the early 1970s,

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:25.829
as I was also started in this universe
in New York City in the early 1970s.

00:14:25.853 --> 00:14:26.855
(Laughter)

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:28.030
And this logo!

00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:31.305
So me, General Tso's Chicken
and this logo are all karmicly related.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.297
But that dish also took about 10 years
to spread across America

00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:36.000
from a restaurant in New York City.

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:38.798
Someone's like, "It's sweet,
it's fried, it's chicken --

00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:40.195
Americans will love this."

00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:44.175
So what I like to say,
this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:48.342
is that we think of McDonald's as sort
of the Microsoft of dining experiences.

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:51.122
We can think of Chinese
restaurants perhaps as Linux,

00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:53.392
sort of an open-source thing, right?

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:54.418
(Laughter)

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:58.087
Where ideas from one person
can be copied and propagated

00:14:58.111 --> 00:14:59.332
across the entire system,

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:03.203
that there can be specialized
versions of Chinese food,

00:15:03.227 --> 00:15:04.378
depending on the region.

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:08.000
For example, in New Orleans
we have Cajun Chinese food,

00:15:08.024 --> 00:15:11.794
where they serve Sichuan alligator
and sweet and sour crawfish.

00:15:11.818 --> 00:15:15.079
And in Philadelphia,
you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,

00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:18.442
which is like an egg roll on the outside
and cheesesteak on the inside.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:22.192
I was surprised to discover that not only
in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.

00:15:22.216 --> 00:15:23.367
What had happened was,

00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:27.954
a Chinese family had moved
from Philadelphia to Atlanta,

00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:29.605
and brought that with them.

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.326
So the thing is,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.138
our historical lore,
because of the way we like narratives,

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:37.191
is full of vast characters,
such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:39.471
and Ray Kroc with McDonald's

00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:41.976
and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.123
But, you know, it's very easy
to overlook the smaller characters.

00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.831
For example, Lem Sen,
who introduced chop suey,

00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:51.232
Chef Peng, who introduced
General Tso's Chicken,

00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:54.976
and all the Japanese bakers
who introduced fortune cookies.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.777
So, the point of my presentation
is to make you think twice;

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:01.239
that those whose names
are forgotten in history

00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:03.350
can often have had as much, if not more,

00:16:03.374 --> 00:16:05.269
impact on what we eat today.

00:16:05.293 --> 00:16:06.444
Thank you very much.

00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:12.619
(Applause)
