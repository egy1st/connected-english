WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.239
I'll just start talking
about the 17th century.

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:03.976
I hope nobody finds that offensive.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.976
I -- you know, when I --
after I had invented PCR,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.976
I kind of needed a change.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.976
And I moved down to La Jolla
and learned how to surf.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.976
And I started living down there
on the beach for a long time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
And when surfers are out waiting

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
for waves,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
you probably wonder, if you've never
been out there, what are they doing?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
You know, sometimes there's a 10-,
15-minute break out there

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when you're waiting for a wave to come in.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.024
They usually talk about the 17th century.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
You know, they get a real
bad rap in the world.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
People think they're sort of lowbrows.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.143
One day, somebody suggested
I read this book.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:38.976
It was called --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.976
it was called "The Air Pump,"

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.429
or something like "The
Leviathan and The Air Pump."

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:45.976
It was a real weird book
about the 17th century.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.976
And I realized, the roots

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.976
of the way I sort of thought

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.976
was just the only natural
way to think about things.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.976
That -- you know, I was born
thinking about things that way,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.976
and I had always
been like a little scientist guy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.976
And when I went to find out something,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.976
I used scientific methods.
I wasn't real surprised,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.976
you know, when they first told me how --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
how you were supposed to do science,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because I'd already been doing it
for fun and whatever.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.976
But it didn't -- it never occurred to me

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.976
that it had to be invented

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.976
and that it had been invented

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.976
only 350 years ago.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.976
You know, it was --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.976
like it happened in England,
and Germany, and Italy

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.976
sort of all at the same time.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.976
And the story of that,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.976
I thought, was really fascinating.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.143
So I'm going to talk
a little bit about that,

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.976
and what exactly is it
that scientists are supposed to do.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.976
And it's, it's a kind of --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.976
You know, Charles I got beheaded

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.976
somewhere early in the 17th century.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.976
And the English set up Cromwell

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.143
and a whole bunch
of Republicans or whatever,

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.167
and not the kind of Republicans we had.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They changed the government,
and it didn't work.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Charles II, the son,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.191
was finally put back
on the throne of England.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.501
He was really nervous,
because his dad had been,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.286
you know, beheaded for being
the King of England

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.310
And he was nervous about the fact

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.976
that conversations that got going

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.976
in, like, bars and stuff

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.976
would turn to --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.976
but people in the 17th century in England

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.976
were starting to talk about, you know,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.976
philosophy and stuff in bars.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.976
They didn't have TV screens,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.334
and they didn't have
any football games to watch.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.976
And they would get really pissy,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.239
and all of a sudden people would spill
out into the street and fight

00:02:34.263 --> 00:02:35.976
about issues like whether or not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.976
it was okay if Robert Boyle

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.976
made a device called the vacuum pump.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.976
Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.976
He was a Christian guy
during the weekends,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
but during the week he was a scientist.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.976
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
Which was -- back then it was

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.976
sort of, you know, well, you know --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.524
if you made this thing --
he made this little device,

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:00.976
like kind of like a bicycle pump

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.976
in reverse that could suck
all the air out of --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.976
you know what a bell jar is?
One of these things,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.334
you pick it up, put it
down, and it's got a seal,

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:09.976
and you can see inside of it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.976
so you can see what's going
on inside this thing.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.976
But what he was trying to do
was to pump all the air out of there,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.976
and see what would happen inside there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.048
I mean, the first -- I think
one of the first experiments he did

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.976
was he put a bird in there.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.976
And people in the 17th century,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.976
they didn't really understand
the same way we do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.976
about you know, this stuff is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.976
a bunch of different kinds of molecules,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.976
and we breathe it
in for a purpose and all that.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.976
I mean, fish don't know much about water,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.976
and people didn't know much about air.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.976
But both started exploring it.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.976
One thing, he put a bird in there,
and he pumped all the air out,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.976
and the bird died. So he said, hmm...

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
He said -- he called
what he'd done as making --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.191
they didn't call it
a vacuum pump at the time.

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:55.976
Now you call it a vacuum
pump; he called it a vacuum.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.976
Right? And immediately,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.976
he got into trouble with the local clergy

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.976
who said, you can't make a vacuum.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.976
Ah, uh --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.976
(Laughter)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.976
Aristotle said that nature abhors one.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.096
I think it was a poor
translation, probably,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.976
but people relied
on authorities like that.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.976
And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.976
I make them all the time.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.976
I mean, whatever
that is that kills the bird --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.976
and I'm calling it a vacuum.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
And the religious people said that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.976
if God wanted you to make --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.976
I mean, God is everywhere,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.381
that was one of their rules,
is God is everywhere.

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:38.501
And a vacuum --
there's nothing in a vacuum,

00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:40.976
so you've -- God couldn't be in there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.239
So therefore the church said that you
can't make a vacuum, you know.

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:45.976
And Boyle said, bullshit.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.976
I mean, you want to call it Godless,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.976
you know, you call it Godless.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.976
But that's not my job. I'm not into that.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I do that on the weekend. And like --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.976
what I'm trying to do
is figure out what happens

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.976
when you suck everything
out of a compartment.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.143
And he did all these
cute little experiments.

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.976
Like he did one with --
he had a little wheel,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
like a fan, that was

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.976
sort of loosely attached,
so it could spin by itself.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.976
He had another fan opposed to it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.976
that he had like a --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.976
I mean, the way I would have done
this would be, like, a rubber band,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.239
and, you know, around a tinker
toy kind of fan.

00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:23.263
I know exactly how he did
it; I've seen the drawings.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.976
It's two fans, one which he could
turn from outside

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.976
after he got the vacuum established,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.976
and he discovered that if he pulled
all the air out of it,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.976
the one fan would no longer
turn the other one, right?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.976
Something was missing, you know.
I mean, these are --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.976
it's kind of weird to think that someone
had to do an experiment to show that,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but that was what was going
on at the time.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.976
And like, there was big arguments about it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.286
in the -- you know, the gin houses
and in the coffee shops and stuff.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.976
And Charles

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.976
started not liking that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Charles II was kind of saying, you
know, you should keep that --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.976
let's make a place where
you can do this stuff

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
where people don't get so -- you know,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.976
we don't want the -- we don't want to get
the people mad at me again. And so --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.976
because when they started
talking about religion

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.976
and science and stuff like that,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.667
that's when it had sort of gotten
his father in trouble.

00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:13.976
And so,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.048
Charles said, I'm going
to put up the money

00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:17.976
give you guys a building,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.048
come here and you can
meet in the building,

00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:22.168
but just don't talk
about religion in there.

00:06:22.192 --> 00:06:23.976
And that was fine with Boyle.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.667
He said, OK, we're going
to start having these meetings.

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.976
And anybody who wants to do science is --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.976
this is about the time that Isaac
Newton was starting to whip out

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.976
a lot of really interesting things.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.334
And there was all kind of people
that would come to the Royal Society,

00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:38.976
they called it. You had to be
dressed up pretty well.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.976
It wasn't like a TED conference.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.976
That was the only criteria,
was that you be --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
you looked like a gentleman,
and they'd let anybody could come.

00:06:46.024 --> 00:06:47.976
You didn't have to be a member then.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.191
And so, they would come
in and you would do --

00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:52.976
Anybody that was going
to show an experiment,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.976
which was kind of a new word at the time,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.976
demonstrate some principle,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.976
they had to do it on stage,
where everybody could see it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.976
So they were --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.976
the really important part of this was,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.976
you were not supposed to talk

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.976
about final causes, for instance.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.976
And God was out of the picture.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The actual nature of reality
was not at issue.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.143
You're not supposed to talk
about the absolute nature of anything.

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:20.263
You were not supposed
to talk about anything

00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:21.976
that you couldn't demonstrate.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.477
So if somebody could see it, you could
say, here's how the machine works,

00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:28.501
here's what we do, and then
here's what happens.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.976
And seeing what happens, it was OK

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.976
to generalize,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.976
and say, I'm sure that this
will happen anytime

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.976
we make one of these things.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And so you can start making up some rules.

00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.976
You say, anytime you have a vacuum state,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.976
you will discover that one wheel
will not turn another one,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.976
if the only connection between them

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.976
is whatever was there before the vacuum.
That kind of thing.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.976
Candles can't burn in a vacuum,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.976
therefore, probably
sparklers wouldn't either.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.976
It's not clear; actually sparklers will,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.976
but they didn't know that.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.976
They didn't have sparklers. But, they --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.976
(Laughter)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.334
-- you can make up rules,
but they have to relate

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.976
only to the things
that you've been able to demonstrate.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.976
And most the demonstrations
had to do with visuals.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.976
Like if you do an experiment on stage,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.976
and nobody can see it, they can just hear it,
they would probably think you were freaky.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.976
I mean, reality is what you can see.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.976
That wasn't an explicit
rule in the meeting,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.976
but I'm sure that was part of it,
you know. If people hear voices,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.976
and they can't see and associate
it with somebody,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.976
that person's probably not there.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.048
But the general idea
that you could only --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.524
you could only really talk
about things in that place

00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:42.976
that had some kind of experimental basis.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.976
It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.976
who was a local philosopher,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.976
said about it, you know,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.524
because you weren't going
to be talking final causes.

00:08:51.548 --> 00:08:52.976
What's happening here,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.976
in the middle of the 17th century,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.976
was that what became my field --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.976
science, experimental science --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
was pulling itself away,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.976
and it was in a physical way, because we're
going to do it in this room over here,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.976
but it was also what -- it
was an amazing thing that happened.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.976
Science had been all interlocked

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.976
with theology, and philosophy,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.976
and -- and -- and mathematics,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which is really not science.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.048
But experimental science had
been tied up with all those things.

00:09:19.072 --> 00:09:21.976
And the mathematics part

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.976
and the experimental science part

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.976
was pulling away from philosophy.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.976
And -- things --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.976
we never looked back.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's been so cool since then.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.976
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled
a thing that was really impeding

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.976
technology from being developed.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.976
And, I mean, everybody in this room --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.976
now, this is 350 short years ago.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.976
Remember, that's a short time.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It was 300,000, probably, years ago

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.976
that most of us, the ancestors
of most of us in this room

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.143
came up out of Africa
and turned to the left.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.976
You know, the ones that turned
to the right, there are some of those

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.976
in the Japanese translation.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.976
But that happened very -- a long time ago

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.976
compared to

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.976
350 short years ago.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.976
But in that 350 years,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.976
the place has just undergone
a lot of changes.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.976
In fact, everybody in this room probably,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.976
especially if you picked up your bag --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.976
some of you, I know, didn't
pick up your bags --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.976
but if you picked up your bag,
everybody in this room

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.239
has got in their pocket,
or back in their room,

00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:23.976
something

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.976
that 350 years ago,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
kings would have gone to war to have.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
I mean, if you can think how important --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.976
If you have a GPS system
and there are no satellites,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.048
it's not going to be much use.
But, like --

00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:37.120
but, you know, if somebody
had a GPS system

00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:39.976
in the 17th century

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.976
some king would have
gotten together an army

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.976
and gone to get it, you know.
If that person --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.143
Audience: For the teddy bear?
The teddy bear?

00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:49.120
Kary Mullis: They might have done
it for the teddy bear, yeah.

00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:50.976
But -- all of us own stuff.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.976
I mean, individuals own things

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.477
that kings would have
definitely gone to war to get.

00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.976
And this is just 350 years.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.048
Not a whole lot of people
doing this stuff.

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:00.976
You know, the important people --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.976
you can almost read about their lives,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.191
about all the really important
people that made advances, you know.

00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:07.976
And, I mean --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.976
this kind of stuff, you
know, all this stuff

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.976
came from that separation

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.976
of this little sort of thing that we do --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.976
now I, when I was a boy

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.976
was born sort of with this idea

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.976
that if you want to know something --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.976
you know, maybe it's because my old
man was gone a lot,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.191
and my mother didn't
really know much science,

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.882
but I thought if you want
to know something about stuff,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.191
you do it -- you make
an experiment, you know.

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:32.976
You get -- you get, like --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.976
I just had a natural feeling for science

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.976
and setting up experiments. I thought
that was the way everybody had always thought.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.976
I thought that anybody
with any brains will do it that way.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.976
It isn't true. I mean,
there's a lot of people --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.976
You know, I was one of those
scientists that was --

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
got into trouble the other night at dinner

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:50.976
because of the post-modernism thing.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.976
And I didn't mean, you know
-- where is that lady?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.976
Audience: Here.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.976
(Laughter)

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.667
KM: I mean, I didn't really
think of that as an argument

00:11:57.691 --> 00:11:59.976
so much as just a lively discussion.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I didn't take it personally, but --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.976
I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
until this surfing experience
started me into the 17th century,

00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:11.263
I'd thought that's just
the way people thought,

00:12:11.287 --> 00:12:13.976
and everybody did,
and they recognized reality

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.286
by what they could see
or touch or feel or hear.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
At any rate, when I was a boy,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.976
I, like, for instance, I had this --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.976
I got this little book
from Fort Sill, Oklahoma --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.191
This is about the time
that George Dyson's dad

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:29.976
was starting to blow nuclear --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.976
thinking about blowing
up nuclear rockets and stuff.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.976
I was thinking about making
my own little rockets.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.976
And I knew that frogs -- little frogs --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.976
had aspirations of space travel,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.976
just like people. And I --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.976
(Laughter)

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.976
I was looking for a --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.976
a propulsion system

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.976
that would like, make a rocket, like,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.429
maybe about four feet high
go up a couple of miles.

00:12:54.453 --> 00:12:56.976
And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.334
I wanted it to go out of sight and then
I wanted this little parachute

00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:02.976
to come back with the frog in it.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.976
And -- I -- I --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.976
I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.976
where there's a missile base.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They send it out for amateur rocketeers,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.976
and

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.976
it said in there

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.976
do not ever heat a mixture
of potassium perchlorate and sugar.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.976
(Laughter)

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.976
You know,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.976
that's what you call a lead.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.976
(Laughter)

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.976
You sort of -- now you say,
well, let's see if I can

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.976
get hold of some potassium chlorate
and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.976
and heat it; it would be interesting to see
what it is they don't want me to do,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.572
and what it is going to --
and how is it going to work.

00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:39.976
And we didn't have --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.976
like, my mother

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.976
presided over the back yard

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.976
from an upstairs window,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.976
where she would be ironing
or something like that.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.976
And she was usually just
sort of keeping an eye on,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.191
and if there was any puffs
of smoke out there,

00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:54.976
she'd lean out and admonish us all

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
not to blow our eyes out. That was her --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.976
You know, that was kind of the worst
thing that could happen to us.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
That's why I thought, as long
as I don't blow my eyes out...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.976
I may not care about the fact

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.976
that it's prohibited
from heating this solution.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.143
I'm going to do it
carefully, but I'll do it.

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.167
It's like anything else that's prohibited:

00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:14.976
you do it behind the garage.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.976
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.976
So, I went to the drug store

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.976
and I tried to buy
some potassium perchlorate

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.976
and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.976
to walk into a drug store
and buy chemicals.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.976
Nowadays, it's no ma'am,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.976
check your shoes. And like --

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.976
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.976
But then it wasn't -- they didn't
have any, but the guy had --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.976
I said, what kind of salts
of potassium do you have? You know.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.976
And he had potassium nitrate.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.976
And I said, that might do
the same thing, whatever it is.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.976
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets
or it wouldn't be in that manual.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.976
And so I -- I did some experiments.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.286
You know, I started
off with little tiny amounts

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.976
of potassium nitrate and sugar,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.976
which was readily available,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.976
and I mixed it in different proportions,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and I tried to light it on fire.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.667
Just to see what would happen,
if you mixed it together.

00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:02.976
And it -- they burned.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.976
It burned kind of slow,
but it made a nice smell,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.048
compared to other rocket
fuels I had tried,

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.976
that all had sulfur in them.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And, it smelt like burnt candy.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.976
And then I tried the melting
business, and I melted it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.976
And then it melted into a little sort
of syrupy liquid, brown.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.976
And then it cooled
down to a brick-hard substance,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.976
that when you lit that,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.976
it went off like a bat.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.976
I mean, the little bowl of that stuff
that had cooled down --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.976
you'd light it, and it would just
start dancing around the yard.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.976
And I said, there

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.976
is a way to get a frog
up to where he wants to go.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.976
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.976
So I started developing --

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
you know, George's dad had a lot of help.
I just had my brother.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.976
But I -- it took me
about -- it took me about,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.976
I'd say, six months

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.048
to finally figure
out all the little things.

00:15:49.072 --> 00:15:50.976
There's a lot of little things involved

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.191
in making a rocket that it
will actually work,

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:54.976
even after you have the fuel.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.976
But you do it, by -- what I just--

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.976
you know, you do experiments,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.976
and you write down things sometimes,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.976
you make observations, you know.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.976
And then you slowly build up a theory

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.976
of how this stuff works.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.096
And it was --
I was following all the rules.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.976
I didn't know what the rules were,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.976
I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.976
or some kind of a throwback
to the 17th century, whatever.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.976
But at any rate, we finally did

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.976
have a device that would reproduceably

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.976
put a frog out of sight

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.976
and get him back alive.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.976
And we had not --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.976
I mean, we weren't frightened by it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.429
We should have been,
because it made a lot of smoke

00:16:32.453 --> 00:16:33.976
and it made a lot of noise,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.976
and it was powerful, you know.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.976
And once in a while, they would blow up.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.976
But I wasn't worried, by the way,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.976
about, you know,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.976
the explosion causing
the destruction of the planet.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.976
I hadn't heard about the 10 ways

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.976
that we should be afraid of the --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.976
By the way,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.976
I could have thought,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.976
I'd better not do this because

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.976
they say not to, you know.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.976
And I'd better get permission
from the government.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.976
If I'd have waited around for that,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I would have never -- the frog
would have died, you know.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.976
At any rate, I bring it
up because it's a good story,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.976
and he said, tell personal things,
you know, and that's a personal --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I was going to tell you about the first
night that I met my wife,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.096
but that would be too
personal, wouldn't it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.429
So, so I've got something
else that's not personal.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.976
But that... process
is what I think of as science,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.976
see, where you start with some idea,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and then instead of, like, looking up,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.976
every authority that you've ever heard of

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.976
I -- sometimes you do that,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.976
if you're going to write a paper later,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.976
you want to figure
out who else has worked on it.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.143
But in the actual process,
you get an idea --

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:37.976
like, when I got the idea one night

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.976
that I could amplify DNA
with two oligonucleotides,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.858
and I could make lots of copies
of some little piece of DNA,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.976
you know, the thinking for that

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
was about 20 minutes
while I was driving my car,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.572
and then instead of going -- I went
back and I did talk to people about it,

00:17:53.596 --> 00:17:57.787
but if I'd listened to what I heard
from all my friends who were molecular biologists --

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.976
I would have abandoned it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.976
You know, if I had gone back
looking for an authority figure

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
who could tell me if it would work or not,

00:18:04.024 --> 00:18:06.024
he would have said, no, it probably won't.

00:18:06.048 --> 00:18:09.024
Because the results of it
were so spectacular

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.976
that if it worked it was going to change
everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.976
Nobody wants a chemist to come in

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.976
and poke around in their stuff
like that and change things.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.976
But if you go to authority,
and you always don't --

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.048
you don't always get
the right answer, see.

00:18:22.072 --> 00:18:23.976
But I knew, you'd go into the lab

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.976
and you'd try to make it work yourself.
And then you're the authority,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.976
and you can say, I know it works,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.976
because right there in that tube

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.976
is where it happened,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.976
and here, on this gel,
there's a little band there

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
that I know that's DNA,
and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,

00:18:37.024 --> 00:18:38.976
so there! So it does work.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.976
You know, that's how you do science.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.976
And then you say, well,
what can make it work better?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.976
And then you figure out better
and better ways to do it.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But you always work from, from like, facts

00:18:47.024 --> 00:18:49.976
that you have made available to you

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.976
by doing experiments: things
that you could do on a stage.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.976
And no tricky shit behind the thing.
I mean, it's all --

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.976
you've got to be very honest

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.976
with what you're doing if it
really is going to work.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.976
I mean, you can't make up results,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.334
and then do another experiment
based on that one.

00:19:03.358 --> 00:19:04.976
So you have to be honest.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.976
And I'm basically honest.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.976
I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty
would always get me in trouble,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.667
if I, like -- so I've just
sort of been naturally honest

00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:14.691
and naturally inquisitive,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.239
and that sort of leads
to that kind of science.

00:19:17.263 --> 00:19:18.976
Now, let's see...

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.976
I've got another five minutes, right?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
OK. All scientists aren't like that.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.976
You know -- and there is a lot --

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.976
(Laughter)

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.239
There is a lot -- a lot
has been going on since

00:19:32.263 --> 00:19:34.976
Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.976
One of the things that happened
right around World War II

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.976
in that same time period before,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.976
and as sure as hell afterwards,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
government got -- realized
that scientists aren't strange dudes

00:19:44.024 --> 00:19:46.976
that, you know, hide in ivory towers

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.976
and do ridiculous things with test tube.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.976
Scientists, you know, made World War II

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.976
as we know it quite possible.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
They made faster things.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.976
They made bigger guns
to shoot them down with.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.976
You know, they made drugs
to give the pilots

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.976
if they were broken up in the process.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.976
They made all kinds of --
and then finally one giant bomb

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.976
to end the whole thing, right?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.976
And everybody stepped back
a little and said, you know,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.976
we ought to invest in this shit,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.976
because whoever has got
the most of these people

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.976
working in the places is going
to have a dominant position,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.976
at least in the military, and probably
in all kind of economic ways.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.976
And they got involved
in it, and the scientific

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.976
and industrial establishment was born,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.976
and out of that came a lot of scientists

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.976
who were in there for the money, you know,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.976
because it was suddenly available.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.976
And they weren't the curious little boys

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.976
that liked to put frogs up in the air.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.976
They were the same people that later
went in to medical school, you know,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.976
because there was money in it, you know. I mean,
later, then they all got into business --

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.976
I mean, there are waves of --
going into your high school,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.976
person saying, you want to be rich, you know,
be a scientist. You know, not anymore.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.

00:20:53.024 --> 00:20:56.501
But a lot of people got in it for the money
and the power and the travel.

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:59.501
That's back when travel was easy.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.976
And those people don't think --

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.976
they don't --

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.976
they don't always tell
you the truth, you know.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.096
There is nothing
in their contract, in fact,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.096
that makes it to their advantage always,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.976
to tell you the truth.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.976
And the people I'm talking
about are people that like --

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.976
they say that they're
a member of the committee

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.976
called, say, the Inter-Governmental
Panel on Climate Change.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.477
And they -- and they have these big
meetings where they try to figure out

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.762
how we're going to -- how we're
going to continually prove

00:21:28.786 --> 00:21:30.976
that the planet is getting warmer,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.976
when that's actually contrary
to most people's sensations.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.976
I mean, if you actually measure

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.976
the temperature over a period --

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.143
I mean, the temperature
has been measured now

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:42.976
pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years --

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.976
longer than that it's been measured,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.976
but in really nice, precise ways,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.976
and records have been kept
for 50 or 60 years,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.976
and in fact, the temperature
hadn't really gone up.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.976
It's like, the average temperature

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.976
has gone up a tiny little bit,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.976
because the nighttime temperatures

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.976
at the weather stations have
come up just a little bit.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.976
But there's a good explanation for that.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.096
And it's that the weather stations
are all built outside of town,

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.976
where the airport was, and now

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.976
the town's moved out there,
there's concrete all around

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.976
and they call it the skyline effect.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.976
And most responsible people

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.976
that measure temperatures realize

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.429
you have to shield
your measuring device from that.

00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:20.976
And even then, you know,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.976
because the buildings get
warm in the daytime,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
and they keep it a little warmer at night.

00:22:24.024 --> 00:22:26.000
So the temperature has
been, sort of, inching up.

00:22:26.024 --> 00:22:28.976
It should have been. But not a lot.
Not like, you know --

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.976
the first guy -- the first
guy that got the idea

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.976
that we're going to fry ourselves here,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.976
actually, he didn't think of it that way.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.976
His name was Sven Arrhenius.
He was Swedish, and he said,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.976
if you double the CO2
level in the atmosphere,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.096
which he thought might
-- this is in 1900 --

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.048
the temperature ought to go
up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.

00:22:47.072 --> 00:22:49.263
He was thinking of the earth
as, kind of like,

00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:51.976
you know, like a completely
insulated thing

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.976
with no stuff in it, really,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.976
just energy coming down, energy leaving.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.976
And so he came up with this theory,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.976
and he said, this will be cool,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.976
because it'll be a longer
growing season in Sweden,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.976
you know, and the surfers liked it,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.976
the surfers thought, that's a cool idea,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.976
because it's pretty cold
in the ocean sometimes, and --

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.976
but a lot of other people later on

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.048
started thinking it
would be bad, you know.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.048
But nobody actually
demonstrated it, right?

00:23:17.072 --> 00:23:18.976
I mean, the temperature as measured --

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.286
and you can find this
on our wonderful Internet,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.976
you just go and look
for all NASAs records,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.976
and all the Weather Bureau's records,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.976
and you'll look at it yourself,
and you'll see, the temperature has just --

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the nighttime temperature measured
on the surface of the planet

00:23:32.024 --> 00:23:33.976
has gone up a tiny little bit.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.976
So if you just average that and the daytime
temperature, it looks like it went up

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.976
about .7 degrees in this century.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.976
But in fact, it was just coming up --

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.858
it was the nighttime; the daytime
temperatures didn't go up.

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:45.976
So -- and Arrhenius' theory --

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.976
and all the global warmers think --

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.976
they would say, yeah, it should
go up in the daytime, too,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.976
if it's the greenhouse effect.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.976
Now, people like things
that have, like, names like that,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.976
that they can envision it, right?
I mean --

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.905
but people don't like things
like this, so -- most -- I mean,

00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:02.929
you don't get all excited about things

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.976
like the actual evidence, you know,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.976
which would be evidence for strengthening

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.976
of the tropical circulation in the 1990s.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.976
It's a paper that came out in February,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.976
and most of you probably
hadn't heard about it.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.976
"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
in the Tropical Mean
Radiative Energy Budget."

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.976
Excuse me. Those papers
were published by NASA,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.048
and some scientists
at Columbia, and Viliki

00:24:26.072 --> 00:24:28.976
and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.976
And those two papers came
out in Science Magazine,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.976
February the first,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.976
and these -- the conclusion
in both of these papers,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.976
and in also the Science editor's, like,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.096
descriptions of these
papers, for, you know,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.976
for the quickie,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.976
is that our theories about global warming

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.976
are completely wrong. I mean,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.976
what these guys were doing,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.976
and this is what -- the NASA people
have been saying this for a long time.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.976
They say, if you measure the temperature
of the atmosphere, it isn't going up --

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.477
it's not going up at all. We've doing
it very carefully now for 20 years,

00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:01.976
from satellites, and it isn't going up.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.976
And in this paper, they show
something much more striking,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.976
and that was that they did
what they call a radiation --

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.976
and I'm not going to go into the details
of it, actually it's quite complicated,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.976
but it isn't as complicated
as they might make you think it is

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.976
by the words they use in those papers.
If you really get down to it, they say,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.191
the sun puts out a certain
amount of energy --

00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:20.976
we know how much that is --

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.905
it falls on the earth, the earth
gives back a certain amount.

00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:25.976
When it gets warm it generates --

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.976
it makes redder energy --
I mean, like infra-red,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.976
like something that's warm
gives off infra-red.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.048
The whole business
of the global warming --

00:25:34.072 --> 00:25:35.976
trash, really,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
is that -- if the -- if there's too
much CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:25:39.024 --> 00:25:40.976
the heat that's trying to escape

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.976
won't be able to get out. But
the heat coming from the sun,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.976
which is mostly down in the --
it's like 350 nanometers,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.976
which is where it's centered --
that goes right through CO2.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.976
So you still get heated,
but you don't dissipate any.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.976
Well, these guys measured
all of those things.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.976
I mean, you can talk about that stuff,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.858
and you can write these large reports,
and you can get government money to do it,

00:25:59.882 --> 00:26:01.976
but these -- they actually measured it,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.143
and it turns
out that in the last 10 years --

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:06.143
that's why they say "decadal" there --

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:08.976
that the energy -- that the level

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.976
of what they call "imbalance"

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.976
has been way the hell
over what was expected.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.976
Like, the amount of imbalance --

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.976
meaning, heat's coming
in and it's not going out

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.191
that you would get
from having double the CO2,

00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:24.976
which we're not anywhere
near that, by the way.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.976
But if we did, in 2025 or something,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.976
have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.239
they say it would be
increase the energy budget

00:26:32.263 --> 00:26:34.976
by about -- in other words,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.976
one watt per square centimeter more

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.976
would be coming in than going out.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.976
So the planet should get warmer.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.620
Well, they found out in this
study -- these two studies

00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:45.976
by two different teams --

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.976
that five and a half watts

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.976
per square meter

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.976
had been coming in from 1998, 1999,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.976
and the place didn't get warmer.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.976
So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.976
These papers should have been called,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.976
"The End to the Global
Warming Fiasco," you know.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.976
They're concerned,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.976
and you can tell they have very
guarded conclusions in these papers,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.191
because they're talking
about big laboratories

00:27:09.215 --> 00:27:10.976
that are funded by lots of money

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.976
and by scared people.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.976
You know, if they said, you know what?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.976
There isn't a problem
with global warming any longer,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.976
so we can -- you know, they're funding.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.762
And if you start a grant request
with something like that,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.429
and say, global warming
obviously hadn't happened...

00:27:24.453 --> 00:27:26.429
if they -- if they -- if they actually
-- if they actually said that,

00:27:26.453 --> 00:27:27.976
I'm getting out.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.976
(Laughter)

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.976
I'll stand up too, and --

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.976
(Laughter)

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.976
(Applause)

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.976
They have to say that.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.976
They had to be very cautious.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.143
But what I'm saying is,
you can be delighted,

00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:46.976
because the editor
of Science, who is no dummy,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.976
and both of these fairly professional --

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.976
really professional teams, have
really come to the same conclusion

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.976
and in the bottom lines in their papers

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
they have to say, what this means
is, that what we've been thinking,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.239
was the global circulation
model that we predict

00:28:00.263 --> 00:28:02.239
that the earth is going to get overheated

00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:04.976
that it's all wrong.
It's wrong by a large factor.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.976
It's not by a small one. They just --

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.976
they just misinterpreted
the fact that the earth --

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
there's obviously some mechanisms going on

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.976
that nobody knew about,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.976
because the heat's coming
in and it isn't getting warmer.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.976
So the planet is a pretty
amazing thing, you know,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.976
it's big and horrible --
and big and wonderful,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.976
and it does all kinds of things
we don't know anything about.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.976
So I mean, the reason I put
those things all together,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.976
OK, here's the way you're
supposed to do science --

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.976
some science is done for other
reasons, and just curiosity.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.286
And there's a lot of things
like global warming,

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.976
and ozone hole and you know,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
a whole bunch of scientific public issues,

00:28:38.024 --> 00:28:39.976
that if you're interested in them,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.096
then you have to get down the details,
and read the papers called,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.976
"Large Decadal Variability in the..."

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.286
You have to figure
out what all those words mean.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.976
And if you just listen to the guys

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.976
who are hyping those issues,
and making a lot of money out of it,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.286
you'll be misinformed, and you'll be
worrying about the wrong things.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.691
Remember the 10 things that are going
to get you. The -- one of them --

00:28:58.715 --> 00:28:59.976
(Laughter)

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.976
And the asteroids is the one I really
agree with there.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.810
I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids.
OK, thank you for having me here.

00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:09.834
(Applause)
