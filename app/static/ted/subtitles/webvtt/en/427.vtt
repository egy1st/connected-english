00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides 



00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
from way back when,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, basically it all began with 



00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this whole idea of a computer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Who has a computer? Yeah.



00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
O.K., so, everyone has a computer.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer. 



00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And -- anyone remember this workbook, 



00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- 



00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
free poster in each book?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This was how computing began. 



00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software. 



00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, 



00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and it would do absolutely nothing at all. 



00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you had to program it, 



00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this. 



00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean, this was great. 



00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's such a great way to -- 



00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I mean, they should make Java books like this, 



00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we've have no problem learning a program. 



00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But this was a great, grand time of the computer, 



00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era. 



00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And, you see,



00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this era coincided with my own childhood.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. 



00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Who of you grew up in a family business, 



00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
suffered the torture? Yes, yes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture? 



00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu; 



00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it was a family business. 



00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And my mother was a kind of a designer, also. 



00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking, 



00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and it would confuse the customers, 



00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because they all thought it was a restaurant.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever. 



00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, anyway, that's where I grew up, 



00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in this little tofu factory in Seattle, 



00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and it was kind of like this: 



00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.



00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really: 



00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.



00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here, 



00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, 


00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing, 



00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and so you have to have heavy stuff 



00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to push out the liquid and make it hard. 



00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Tofu comes out in these big batches, 



00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and my father would sort of cut them by hand. 



00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this -- 



00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
my father was the most sincere man possible. 



00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,



00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway. 



00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken 



00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for two weeks in the store, and that week -- 



00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I 



00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
had to do everything.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that was torture, real torture. 



00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Because, you see, we'd seen my father 



00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow. 



00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this. 



00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Bad blocks. But anyways, 



00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And because working in a store was so hard, 



00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I liked going to school; it was like heaven. 



00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I was really good at school. 



00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, when I got to MIT, you know, 



00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
as most of you who are creatives,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
your parents all told you not to be creative, right? 



00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So, same way, you know, 



00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
John's good at math. 



00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I went to MIT, did my math, 



00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but I had this wonderful opportunity,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because computers had just become visual. 



00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out; 



00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT. 



00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of, 



00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
could cross the two sides --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it was a good time. 



00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so, I remember that my first major piece of software 



00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker. 



00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I made a desktop publishing system way back when, 



00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to -- 



00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix. 



00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And the problem when you're younger --



00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
for all you students out there --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is, your head gets kind of big really easy. 



00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And when I was making icons, I was, like, 



00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the icon master,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know. 



00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then luckily, you know, 



00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I had the fortune of going to something called a library, 



00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and in the library I came upon this very book. 



00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I found this book. It's called, 



00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this. 



00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, 



00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who was one of the greatest graphic designers, 



00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and also a great writer as well. 



00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And when I saw this man's work, 



00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I realized how bad I was at design,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
or whatever I called it back then, 



00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, 



00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
kind of in hot pursuit.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished. 


00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I got my masters,
and then went to art school after that.



00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And just began to design stuff,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:



00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever. 



00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?



00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs? 



00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it? 



00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, I was published, you know, 



00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know? 



00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
After that, things kind of got strange, 



00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and I got thinking about the computer, 



00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me. 



00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand



00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was a kind of crusty designer, 



00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread? 



00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You know, he wrote in one of his books: 



00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
"A Yale student once said,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.' 



00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Design schools take heed." 



00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This is in the '80s,



00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A very difficult time, actually. 



00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And this to me was an important message from Rand. 



00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time. 



00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play. 



00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing. 



00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw. 



00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It was very hard to make this, actually. 



00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It took a month to make this part. 



00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And then I thought, what if I added this feature, 



00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
where I can say, this point, 



00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.



00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability 



00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
with a little control there on the dial, 



00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and I can sort of watch it flip around. 


00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And this is in 1993. 


00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me. 



00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They were saying, Why's it moving? 



00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They were saying, Make it stop now.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.



00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?



00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I said, Never.



00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.



00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I started studying this whole idea, 



00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's not like print. It's not like video. 



00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. 



00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So, I went off with this, 



00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and began to look for things even more.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people. 



00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is actually bad: human experiments. 



00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens: 



00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen. 



00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And someone sits down and draws a picture. 



00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They're laughing because he said, 



00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.



00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
See, humans don't know how to take orders; 



00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the computer's so good at it. 



00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once: 



00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And so began to have multiple pens on the page --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
again, hard to do with our hands. 



00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment" 



00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where you could use coordinate systems. 



00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen. 



00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. 



00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It became computerish; we began to think computerish -- 



00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation. 



00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people, 



00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
called a human-powered computer. 



00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So, this happened in 1993.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Sound down, please. 



00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a computer where the people are the parts. 



00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU, 



00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a graphics card, a memory system. 



00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard. 



00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's put inside the computer. 



00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that little program's on that cardboard disk. 



00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, she wears the disk, 



00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really. 



00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I had a moment of -- what is it called? -- 



00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast. 



00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard, 



00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.



00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,



00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen. 



00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around. 



00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour 



00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
for the mouse cursor to change. 



00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale: 



00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.



00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is something I did for Sony in 1996. 



00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It was three Sony "H" devices 



00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that responded to sound.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So, if you talk into the mike,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
you'll hear some music in your headphones; 



00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
if you talk in the phone, then video would happen. 



00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways 



00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
with this kind of mixture of skills. 



00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes. 



00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects. 



00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And also, one thing I realized is that 



00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I like to make things.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We like to make things. It's fun to make things. 



00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. 



00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand -- 



00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
these sort of broken hands.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And these hands were influenced 



00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
This guy was my kind of like mentor. 



00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo. 



00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
He's the guy that kind of discovered me, 



00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and kind of got me going in digital media. 



00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He was such an inspirational guy. 



00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m., 



00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and then he'd show up from some client meeting. 



00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He'd come in and say, you know, 



00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
If I am here, everything is okay.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And you'd feel so much better, you know. 



00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,



00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm. 



00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He went into a coma.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink, 



00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --



00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
how fragile is this thing we're wearing, 



00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
this body and mind we're wearing, 



00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and so I thought, How do you go for it more? 



00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
How do you take that time you have left and go after it? 



00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So, Naomi was pivotal in that. 



00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer. 



00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
This was a moment where I was thinking about, 



00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
so, you have a computer program, 



00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
it responds to motion -- X and Y -- 



00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and I realized that each computer program 



00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
has all these images inside the program.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So, if you can see here, you know, 



00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that program you're seeing in the corner,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once. 



00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with. 



00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We're so used to working in one vector. 



00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is all at the same time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The computer lives in so many dimensions. 



00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And also, at the same time I was frustrated, 



00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, 



00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know, 



00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and this is, like, in the late 1990s, 



00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and this is in Basel,


00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
a great graphic design school.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy, 


00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
kind of, dark computer room. 



00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal? 



00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Is this what we want, you know? 



00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And also, I began to be fascinated by machines -- 



00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive -- 



00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
this is, like, a touch screen -- 



00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and I noticed how you can only touch five places, 



00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?" 



00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
became a question. And also, the sound: 



00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone. 



00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You get it? No? O.K.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And also, I discovered in Logan airport, 



00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
this was, like, calling out to me. 



00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan. 



00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, I was wondering, like, 



00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing? 



00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It didn't make any sense. 



00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects


00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
made of old computers from my basement. 



00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I made -- I took my old Macintoshes 



00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and made different objects out of them from Tokyo. 


00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves, 



00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. 



00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I made this series of works. 



00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle 



00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
as a kind of display that's sort of thinking, 



00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.



00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. 



00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I began to be fascinated by plastic, 



00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks 


00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
perfectly optically transparent, 



00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
as a kind of release of stress.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Because of that, I became interested in blue tape, 



00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.



00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me, 



00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think, 



00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Well, what else is there in life? 



00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And so computers, as you know, 



00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 



00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers, 



00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I began to program one-chip computers 



00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I began to make LED sculptures 



00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that would live inside little boxes out of MDF. 



00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy. 



00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs. 



00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp: 



00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
it's sort of a plastic rice lamp;

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
it's very friendly. 



00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- 



00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I used iPods as a material. 



00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So I took 16 iPod Nanos 



00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Recently, this is for Reebok. 



00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I've done shoes for Reebok as well,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
as a kind of a hobby for apparel. 



00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So anyways, there are all these things you can do, 


00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but the thing I love the most is to 



00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
experience, taste the world.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The world is just so tasty. 



00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are. 



00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
No, they're all out there. 



00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,



00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
actually, around the Louvre area. 



00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me. 



00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature. 



00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.



00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We all are creative people. 



00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We have this gene defect in our mind.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing. 



00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's the forever-always-on museum. 



00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
This is from the Cape last year. 



00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design, 



00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
which we know as circle-triangle-square. 



00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered. 



00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square. 



00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I put these all back, by the way. 



00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And I also discovered how .



00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
some rocks are twins separated at birth.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This is also out there, you know. 



00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing? 



00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I brought you guys together again. 



00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T 



00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
occurring in simplicity and complexity. 



00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment -- 



00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment -- 



00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
where I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And I went after it with passion. 



00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --



00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy, 


00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
because the letters had told me, MIT forever. 



00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But I discovered in the French word raison d'être. 



00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I was, like, aha, wait a second. 



00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And there RISD appeared. 



00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And so I realized it was O.K. to go.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So, I'm going to RISD, actually. 



00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Who's a RISD alum out there? 



00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion, 



00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and I'll tell you a little bit about that. 



00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So, RISD is -- 



00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I was outside RISD,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,



00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is. 



00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually, 



00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
or what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that



00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much. 



00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever. 



00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
People say, 


00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Are you going to bring RISD into the future?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 



00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There's my perspective. Because in reality, 



00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
the problem isn't how to make the world more technological. 



00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It's about how to make it more humane again. 



00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA. 



00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's a strange exuberance



00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
about materials, about the world:

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
a fascination that I think the world needs 



00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
quite very much right now.


00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So, thank you everyone.
