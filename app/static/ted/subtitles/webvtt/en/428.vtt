00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sixty-five million years ago, a very important

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and catastrophic event

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
changed the course of life on land.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And these animals disappeared,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and a separate life, mammals,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the things that we've experienced

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in the entire record of humankind history

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
can't really quite get around the kind of disaster

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that this represented for the Earth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So even before that impact was known,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
even before scientists in general came to an agreement

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
over the theory of evolution,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
actually had divided Earth's life's history

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
into these two episodes:

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with geologic history.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So we have a Mesozoic period,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
an age of fragmentation,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
South America to North America, India to Asia.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so my work, really, is trying to understand

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the character of that Mesozoic radiation

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
compared to the Cenozoic radiation

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
about what life on drifting continents

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
really can tell us about evolution.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The work immediately begs the question,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
"Why didn't they go into the waters?"

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You can go outside -- see many other examples.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and why didn't they burrow?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
what kinds of animals were in those spaces?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
about, you know, how evolution works on land?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the size you are when you inherit

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a vacant ecospace

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
from whatever natural disaster.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Looking at dinosaur evolution

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and studying it, digging it up for many years,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I end up looking at the mammal radiation,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
advancing by an order of magnitude.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You want to measure it by diversity?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You want to measure it by

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the time it took to reach maximum body size?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yes, they do have larger body size,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but many of them are smaller,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to achieve maximum body size

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and invade all those habitats.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So there's lessons to learn,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and there's lessons to learn from the exception,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and many other scholars have made around the world.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We now know this transition is the one time

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that dinosaurs actually went below

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that body size --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we're going to see where they began in a minute --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and it is the one time that they rapidly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
invaded all the habitats

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
They became marine. We now know them today

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
from the ice caps.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
There's burrowing birds.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and, of course, they inhabit the land.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and if you go to different layers, you find things

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,



00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or, more appropriately, feathers -- as to decide whether it's actually

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a non-avian or an avian.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It is the greatest transition that we have, actually,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
on land from one habitat to another,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
bar none,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to understand how a bony,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
could make such a transition.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It is really our greatest -- one of our greatest -- evolutionary sequences.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now, my work began at the beginning.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I'd have to go back to those beds

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
where the earliest dinosaurs existed.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'd like to call for this little video clip

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If we could roll that first video clip.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
through those early beds,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and they're located in Northeastern Argentina.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
dinosaurs had basically taken over.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you get a topographic map,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and find, really, everything that existed --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and you dig a place like that,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
228 million years old, we found

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
what really is the most primitive dinosaur:

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that's the Ur-dinosaur.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
A three-and-a-half foot thing,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
beautiful skull, predator,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
meat-eater, a two-legged animal.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
or your kids know, at least, on four legs.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is sort of a look at the skull,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It looks rather bird-like because it is.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
It's bird-like and hollow.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
or 10 kilograms.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That is 10 times larger

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We are extremely dinosaur-like,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now, if you want to understand what happened

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
then when the continents broke apart,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because it was those continents that are least explored.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you really have to force yourself to go down

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to the four corners of the Earth --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and start putting together some of these pieces.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
in the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
if you could survive an expedition.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
To be able to excavate

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and take them out, you really have to put together

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
an expedition team that can handle the conditions.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Some of them are political. Many of them are physical.



00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental. 



00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
you have to drive into the desert,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you will see landscapes in many cases --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
you can see from what we've discovered --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that nobody else has ever seen.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And the kinds of teams they bring in?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Well, they're

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
composed of

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
people who understand science as adventure with a purpose.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They're usually students who've never seen a desert.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Some of them are more experienced.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
your job as a leader is to try to inspire them

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to do more work than they've ever done in their life

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
under conditions that they can't imagine.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So, 125 degrees is normal.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The ground surface at 150 -- typical.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You're really rubbing shoulders

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with the world's last great nomadic people.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
much as they have for centuries.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and make them enter the pages of history.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
To do that, you've got to actually transport them

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
thousands of miles out of the desert.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
or Niger, in our English language -- north of Nigeria --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that's where this photograph was taken.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Basically you're talking about a country that,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
when we started working there, did not have container traffic.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You transported the bones out yourself

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to the coast of Africa,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That's a 2,000 mile journey.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So enormous excavations and a lot of work,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we erect Jobaria,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It really is a little bit out of place temporally.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It looks nothing like what we would find

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
if we dug in contemporary beds in North America.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And, you know, on and on --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and some of you have had the chance to touch it --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
This is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It is an incredible view of life,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and it really began when we began to understand

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the depth of time.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
It's only been with us for less than a century,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and in that time, that fourth dimension,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and we could actually tell how old some of these things were,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is probably the most profound transformation,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
because it changes the way we look at ourselves

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and the world dramatically.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
When you pick up a piece of history like that,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think it can transform

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
kids that are possibly interested in science.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
That's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Here's some others.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It turns out to have a forebrain

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
one-fifteenth the size of a human.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
This was the cover of Science, because they thought

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that humans were more intelligent than these animals, 



00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but we can see by some in our administration

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
that despite

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the enormous advantage in brain volume

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
smaller raptors.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
all those small animals --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
they all come from northern continents.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and guess what? You start preparing it.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's really a wholly separate radiation.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So what we're trying to piece together here is a story.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that we reconstructed from Africa.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Crocodiles, of course,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And huge things -- I mean, this is a

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
lower jaw just laying there in the desert

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
of this enormous crocodile.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We had to try and reconstruct this.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to understand how crocodiles scale.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Could I have the second little video clip?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We had to find and measure

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the largest crocodiles living today.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Narrator: ... as long as their boat.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Man: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Narrator: If they can just land it,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
this croc will provide useful data,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Man: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Man: I got the back legs.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I've got it. I've got the back legs.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Somebody get the front legs.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Wow.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Sixty-five. Wow.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
That's a big skull.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Narrator: Big, but less than half the size

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
of supercroc's skull.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Man: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Man: I knew it was big.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to release the animal back into the river.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Narrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
One, two, three!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Whoa!

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So -- there were --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Applause)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Well, you know, the -- the fossil record is truly amazing

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We proved with those measurements

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that crocodiles scaled isometrically.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It depended on the shape of their skull, though,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
so we had to actually get those measurements

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Anyway, you find other things, too.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We found this last year.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is a ceremonial disk.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
5,000 years ago is been sitting out there

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's really an island continent.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
It was a precursor to India,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
a messenger from Gondwana --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
a lost paradise of dinosaurs 



00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
isolated for millions of years.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
No one's found them. We know where they are,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and we're going to go and get them next year.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
They're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
but if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
so that we can try to understand

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
some basic patterns of evolution.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that we've been compiling

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but we can learn some of the rules of the game,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and that's really what we're trying to do.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
With regard to the biogeographic question,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the Earth is dividing.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You get divided, and a continent's division

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or you're crafty, and you manage to escape

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
from one to the other and erase that division,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
or you're living peacefully on each side,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and on one side you just go extinct,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and you survive on the other side and create a difference.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And you take those four instances

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and you realize you have a complex problem.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
we call it dispersal -- around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to maintain similarity between continents.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and we do see the continents

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
carving differences among dinosaurs.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We have downgraded this factor.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It carves up the history of life,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and gives us the differences that we see

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
in the dinosaur world towards the end,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
right before the bolide impact.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
The best way to test this is to actually create a model.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I want to give you three dimensions.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So you see the tree of life,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
but now I've added the dimension of area.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time.


00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
This is a computer program

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
which has three knobs.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We can control those things that we're worried about:

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
extinction, sampling, dispersal --

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
going from one area to another.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And ultimately we can control the branching

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to mimic what we think the continents were like,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
which is related to the fact that I never --

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
but there are a number of you out there that started your

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
scientific, technical, entertainment career

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I was one of those. I was failed by my school -- my school failed me.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Who's pointing fingers?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Several teachers nearly killed me.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I found myself in art.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And I went on -- that's my first painting on canvas.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I read a dictionary. I got into college.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It became abstract.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
But really it's the same discipline -- they're kindred disciplines.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I mean, is there anything

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
that is not visualizing what can't be seen,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that's out there, or seeing the distortion

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
that we try to see

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
This is a very extraordinarily visual.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I give you a human face because you're experts at that.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
They're really kindred disciplines.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But what we're trying to create in Chicago

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
is a way to get,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
collect together, those students

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
who are least represented in our science and technology spheres.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
We all know, and there's been several allusions to it,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
that we are failing in our ability to produce

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
enough scientists, engineers and technicians.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and now, as you see the increase

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
in the pace of what we're doing,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
it becomes even more prominent. 
Where are all these people going to come from?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And a more general question for our society is,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
What about all the kids like me that were in school --

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
kids like some of you out there --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
to participate in science and technology?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Niger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
to do something in Niger.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
They have an AIDS problem. I asked --

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
the U.S. State Department asked the government recently,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Dinosaurs was one of them.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Give us a museum of dinosaurs,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
and we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
But when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city I come from --

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
there's legions of kids out there

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
like these.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries --

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
as to how we get these kids involved in science.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We've started in Chicago

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
an organization -- a non-profit organization --

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
called Project Exploration.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
These are two kids from Project Exploration.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We met them in their early stages in high school. They were --

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
failing to poor students,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
and they are now -- one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And we created a track record.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
So, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
90 percent going to college, many first-generation,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
90 percent of those choosing science as a career.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It's gone through science as an inquiry,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
which was a big advance,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
and Dewey back at Chicago --

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
you learn by doing.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
To -- you learn by envisioning yourself

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
as a scientist,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
The next step is to learn the capability

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
to make yourself a scientist.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
You have to have those steps. If you have --

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
It's easy to get kids interested in science.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
and presenting something as a knowledgeable person,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing --

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
and I've talked to some people here at TED --

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
it's not going to look like anything you've seen before.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
It's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
part-conservatory, part-zoo,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and part of an answer to the problem

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
of how you interest kids in science.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Thank you very much.
