00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Many of you could ask the question, you know,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A number of years ago,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of some form would be available.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, 60 years later,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm here to tell you why it's possible.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I was about five years old,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
not very much -- about a year after

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Mr. Ford made his predictions,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was living in a rural part of Canada,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It was a trying and scary thing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for a young kid to be going through.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
At the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I discovered a couple hummingbirds

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that were caught in a shed near my home.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They'd worn themselves out,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
beating themselves against the window,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and, well, they were easy to capture.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that second I let them go they hovered for a second,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
then zipped off into the distance.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I thought, what a great way to get to school.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and I was very inspired by that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And so the next -- over the next

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
six decades, believe it or not,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I've built a number of aircraft,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
what the hummingbird does,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and give you that flexibility.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
after the Latin word "volant," meaning,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to fly in a light, nimble manner.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The FAA, the controlling body above all,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
calls it a "powered lift aircraft."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And they've actually issued a pilot's license --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
there are no operational powered lift aircraft.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is a little bit earlier version of it,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that's why it's given the X designation,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but it's a four-passenger aircraft

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that could take off vertically, like a helicopter --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
therefore it doesn't need an airfield.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
On the ground, it's powered electrically.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's actually classified as a motorcycle

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
because of the three wheels, which is a great asset

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in most states, and actually in all cities.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
of the automobile, forget it -- you're never going to fly it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
(Laughter)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
One could say that a helicopter

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
does pretty much what the hummingbird does,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and gets around in much the same way, and it's true,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but a helicopter is a very complex device.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's expensive --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
so expensive that very few people could own or use it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
as a series of parts -- a large number of parts --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
flying in formation.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Another difference, and I have to describe this,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
because it's very personal,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
another great difference between the helicopter

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and the volantor --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in my case the Skycar volantor --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is the experience that I've had

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in flying both of those.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
you feel like you're being hauled up from above

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
by a vibrating crane.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you really feel like you're being lifted up

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
by a magic carpet,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And it's been a great motivator.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and only when I can persuade my stockholders

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to let me do so,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but it's still one of those wonderful experiences

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that reward you for all that time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
What we really need is something to replace the automobile

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for those 50-plus mile trips.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
If we can get rid of that,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
then the highways will now be useful to you,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as contrasted by what's happening

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in many parts of the world today.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
On this next slide, is an interesting history

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of what we really have seen in infrastructure,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
because whether I give you a perfect Skycar,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
unless you've got a system to use it in.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I'm sure any of you have asked the question,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
you're going to be a passenger.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I can tell you, technically we can build Skycars --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
my God, we went to the moon!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But we have to have these priority changes,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we have to have infrastructure to go with this.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Historically you see that we got around

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
200 years ago by canals,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
As that disappeared we came in with highways.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in the next 10 years.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And where is that going to lead you to?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So the issue then, I've often asked, is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
when is it going to happen?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
When are we going to be able to have these vehicles?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I'd prefer to quote someone else,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
who testified with me before Congress,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and in his position as head of NASA

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
put forward this particular vision

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
of the future of this type of aircraft.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
on average, according to the DOT --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
up to 25,000 feet.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
in the ability to get around

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
as far as speed is concerned.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Unbeknownst to many of you,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
has been under construction for 10 years.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
there's a Russian GPS,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and there's a new GPS system

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
going to Europe, called Galileo.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
With those three systems,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you have what is always necessary --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
a level of redundancy that says,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
if one system fails, you'll still have a way

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to make sure that you're being controlled.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
How would a trip in a Skycar work?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Well, you can't right now

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
take off from your home because it's too noisy.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But it's still fairly quiet.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
After all, if you can fly like that,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
why are you going to drive around on a highway?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Go to a local vertiport,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
plug in your destination,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
delivered almost like a passenger.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --


00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and I've had a lot of bad feedback

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
from people who want to be up there, flying around

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and experiencing that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We flew the first vehicle for the international press 


00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
in 1965, when I really got it started.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and I got a lot of excitement around this,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And then through the various years

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
we invented various vehicles.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Actually the critical point was in 1989,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
how completely stable it was in all circumstances,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
which is of course very critical.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Still not a practical vehicle during all of this,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
but moving in the right direction, we believe.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Finally, in the early part of --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
or actually the middle of 2002,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And we had very small power plants in it at this time.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We are now installing larger powerplants,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
which will make it possible for me to get back on board.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
There's an old adage that applied for the years

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
between 1950s and 1970s,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
when every aeronautical company

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
needs an artificial stabilization system --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that's essential.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
At least for the hover,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and the low-speed flight.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
If that single-stability system,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And the adage that I'm referring to,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that applied at that time,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
was that nothing comes down faster

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
than a VTOL aircraft upside down.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(Laughter)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
In fact, the aircraft companies gave up on

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
vertical-takeoff aircraft

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
more or less for a number of years.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
like the hummingbird,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
has a very high metabolism,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
which means it requires a lot of energy.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
invented the rotary engine.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
A very unique engine -- it's round,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
it's small, it's vibration-free.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
It fits exactly where we need to fit it,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
very critical. In fact that engine --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
for those who are into the automobile --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
know that it recently is applied to the RX8 --

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the Mazda.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Wonderful engine.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
which is twice as good as your car engine today,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
but only half of what we need.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
My company has spent 35 years

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We actually get 175 horsepower

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
into one cubic foot.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We have eight engines in this vehicle.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We have four computers. We have two parachutes.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Redundancy is the critical issue here.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and continued to hover.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
if one computer is not agreeing with the other three,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it's kicked out of the system.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
If you stick around, then good luck.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
There won't be a third chance.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The parachutes are there -- hopefully,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
more for psychological than real reasons, but

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Laughter)

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I'd like to show you an animation in this next one,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
which is one element

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
of the Skycar's use,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
You could think of it personally in your own terms,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of how you might use it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Video: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
in something like the Skycar,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
probably in another volantor form as well,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
will be a significant part of our lives,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
buy a Skycar,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
which I think would be priced at that time perhaps

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
(Laughter)

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
believing in what I'm doing -- both financially and in technical help.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And that has --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I characterized this emerging technology

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
in an aphorism,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
as it's described,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
which really talks about what I've experienced,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and I'm sure what other people may have experienced

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in emerging technologies.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
There's an interesting poll that came out recently

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
under NAS --

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I think it's MSNBC --

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
in which they asked the question,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
"Are you in the market for a volantor?"

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Only seven percent said

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
That we need an alternative to the automobile,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
at least for those 50-mile trips and more,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
so that the highways become usable in today's world.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Thank you.
