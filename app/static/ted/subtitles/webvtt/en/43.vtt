00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the typographically hysterical amongst us.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the threads that seems to have come through

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
loud and clear in the last couple of days

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And how do you bring those two things together?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about this need to bring consumers, to bring people

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
into the process of creating things.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And that's what I want to talk about today.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and something that we kind of bring to life

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
through what we do at Ideo.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And rather than talk about it in the theory,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I think I'm just going to show you an example.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to describe to them what their patient experience was.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I think they were expecting --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
they'd worked with lots of consultants before --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and all kinds of mappy stuff.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The first thing we actually shared with them was this.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This is 59 seconds into the film.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is a minute 59.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
3:19.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
5:10.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
5:58.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
6:20.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We showed them the whole cut,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and they were all completely, what is this?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He just lay in the hospital bed,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
for a really long time.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
from the point of view of the person out --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
was, for these guys, quite a revelation.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So they snapped into action.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So we started with them prototyping some really little things

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you could actually have a conversation with them.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so it created a tiny human interaction.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Very small example of something that they could do.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Not particularly the world's best design solution

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Things that they started doing themselves --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
like changing the floor going into the patient's room

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So you went from public space to private space.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and they put this sticker there.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So that what you could actually do was go into the room

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and write messages to the person who was sick in that room,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which was lovely.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I thought that was a really, really nice example.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So this is not particularly a new idea,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and snapping and turning them into a solution.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It's a history of invention based around this.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
saw her daughter watching the test card,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
waiting for programs to come on one morning

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and from that came Sesame Street.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and was wondering why it took these guys so long

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to get the boxes onto the ship.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And he invented the shipping container.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Second one, without sounding overly Zen,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and this is a quote from the Buddha:

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is often a really interesting place to start."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Again, another medical example here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We were asked by a device producer --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
for medical diagnostics.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This was a device that a nurse uses

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
They'll ask the nurses to input data.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
on this aluminum device

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and I'll explain this in a second --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that they really weren't recognizing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which was the procedure that this device's data was about;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but much more human and practical, was this.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
dictated the design of this product.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I think that's really, really important.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So, again, this idea of workarounds.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and just watching all of these kind of things happen

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
while I've been here.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and the things we kind of do in our environment

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is something that we look at a lot.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
called "Thoughtless Acts?"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
which have huge intention and huge opportunity.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Why do we all follow the line in the street?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We don't know why, but we do.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Again, we're sort of using the world around us

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to create our own design solutions.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This is people designing their own experiences.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You can draw from this.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's there for our use, on some level.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to do all these different things.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We co-opt other experiences --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
we take one item and transfer it to another.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So somebody assumes

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that because somebody else has done something,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that's permission for them to do the same thing.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
without realizing what we're doing.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Third section is this idea of not knowing,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of consciously putting yourself backwards.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and looking at things afresh.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and he was asked by his boss

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to help design a storage system for children.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
because they're impossible to assemble.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
The reality is when you actually watch children,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Children assume permission in a very different way.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Children live on things. They live under things.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
They live around things,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and so their spatial awareness relationship,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and their thinking around storage is totally different.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
sitting under the table.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So, what came out of this?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
This is the storage system that he designed.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
(Laughter)

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It's a completely empathic solution --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
(Laughter)

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and I think that's one of the things.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And putting yourself in the position of the person,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
from this conference is how do we put ourselves

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And then use that information to fuel solutions?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I think that's what this is very much about.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's about this really.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but small enough to win.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Again, that's one of the themes

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
They're now called KickStart.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And, again, as designers,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And that was completely irrelevant.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When you put yourself in the position of these people,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
than the form of it. The way it's produced,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and indigenous materials.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So what seems like a very clunky product

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
is, in fact, incredibly useful.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
it's turning them into entrepreneurs.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
These guys are using this very successfully.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And for us, it's been great

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
because it's won loads of design awards.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the needs of the individuals in the company,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to feel good about a product we were actually designing,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
to all of you this morning.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We feel that this is an important gesture.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I hope you'll all wear them.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So that's it. Thank you.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
(Applause)
