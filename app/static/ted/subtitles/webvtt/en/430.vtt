00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I thought I would talk about today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is the transition from one mode

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of thinking about nature

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to another that's tracked by architecture. 



00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What's interesting about architects is, 



00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we always have tried to justify beauty 



00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by looking to nature,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and arguably, beautiful architecture 



00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
has always been looking at a model of nature. 



00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, for roughly 300 years, 



00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the hot debate in architecture

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was whether the number five 



00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or the number seven

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
was a better proportion to think about architecture, 


00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because the nose was one-fifth of your head, 



00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or because your head was one-seventh of your body. 



00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And the reason that that was the model 



00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of beauty and of nature

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- 



00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it wasn't the 16th century --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and everybody had to dimension a building 



00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in terms of fractions,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so a room would be dimensioned 



00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
as one-fourth of a facade;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and you would get down to the small elements 



00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
by fractional subdivision: 



00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
finer and finer and finer.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented; 



00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
architects stopped using fractions, 



00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and they had a new model of nature. 



00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, what's going on today 



00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is that there's a model of natural form

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which is calculus-based 



00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and which is using digital tools,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and that has a lot of implications 



00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to the way we think about beauty and form, 



00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature. 



00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic, 



00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus, 



00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
although the Gothic architects 



00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
weren't really using calculus to define their forms. 



00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But what was important is, 



00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time 



00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that force and motion was thought of in terms of form. 



00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross: 



00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting 



00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing 



00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the expression of structural force and form. 



00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges, 



00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which optimize structural form

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. 



00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi, 



00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the Catalan architect.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century, 



00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and how that Hanging Chain model 



00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
translates into archways



00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and vaulting.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, in all of these examples, 



00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
structure is the determining force.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams 



00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. 



00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Interestingly, in the last 10 years

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model 



00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to generate the roof of the National Gallery, 



00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
with the structural engineer Chris Williams. 



00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In all these examples, 


00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
there's one ideal form, 


00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because these are thought in terms of structure. 



00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems 



00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms 



00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment. 



00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, what I thought I would bring up is 



00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
another component that needs to be thought of, 



00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
whenever you think about nature, 



00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and that's basically the invention of 



00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
generic form in genetic evolution.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
My hero is actually not Darwin; 


00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
it's a guy named William Bateson,


00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey. 



00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And he was what you'd call a teratologist: 



00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations 


00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.



00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type 



00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
or the ideal average,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,



00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule, 



00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb. 



00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, 



00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.



00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Beautiful, because it has symmetry. 



00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations, 



00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
instead of having a thumb, 



00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you would either get another opposable thumb,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
or you would get four fingers. 



00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So, the mutations reverted to symmetry. 



00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And Bateson invented 



00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the concept of symmetry breaking,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
which is that 



00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
wherever you lose information in a system,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
you revert back to symmetry. 



00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization --



00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect --



00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
symmetry was the absence of information. 



00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry; 



00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
whenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.



00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment 



00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
from looking for ideal shapes 



00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to looking for a combination of 



00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
information and generic form.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You know, literally after seeing that image, 



00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and finding out what Bateson was working with, 



00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to start to think about architectural form. 



00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
To just talk for a minute about the 



00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
digital mediums that we're using now 



00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and how they integrate calculus:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the fact that they're calculus-based 



00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
means that we don't have to think about dimension 


00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in terms of ideal units 



00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or discreet elements.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So, in architecture we deal with

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
big assemblies of components, 



00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so there might be up to, say, 



00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
50,000 pieces of material



00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
in this room you're sitting in right now

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that all need to get organized. 



00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same: 



00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.



00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm 



00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that every chair would be a slightly different dimension, 



00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines. 



00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting, 



00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
they're all losing their modular quality, 



00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions. 



00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That's because we're all using calculus tools 



00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
for manufacturing and for design. 



00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Calculus is also a mathematics of curves. 



00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve. 



00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's just a curve without inflection.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, a new vocabulary of form



00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is now pervading all design fields:

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. 



00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- 



00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you know, in the example of the nose to the face, 



00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there's a fractional part-to-whole idea. 



00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
With calculus, the whole idea 



00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of subdivision is more complex,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
because the whole and the parts are one continuous series. 



00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus, 



00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
so I brought some images to just describe how that works. 



00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
This is a Korean church that we did in Queens. 



00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And in this example, you can see 



00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that the components of this stair are repetitive, 



00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
but they're repetitive without being modular. 



00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Each one of the elements in this structure 



00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is a unique distance and dimension, 



00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and all of the connections are unique angles. 



00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Now, the only way we could design that, 



00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
or possibly construct it,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is by using a calculus-based definition 



00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of the form.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It also is much more dynamic, 



00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so that you can see that the same form opens and closes 



00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
in a very dynamic way as you move across it, 



00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
because it has this quality of vector in motion 


00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
built into it. 


00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume, 



00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista. 



00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And you also get a sense of



00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
visual movement in the space,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern, 



00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar. 



00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I think that's one of the main changes, 



00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
also, in architecture: 



00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
like a Latin cross for a church, 



00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
but actually all the traits of a church:



00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,



00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
directionality that focuses you towards an altar. 



00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It turns out it's not rocket science



00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to design a sacred space.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits 



00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
in a very kind of genetic way. 



00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So, these are the different perspectives of that interior, 



00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which has a very complex 


00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
set of orientations all in a simple form. 


00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
In terms of construction and manufacturing, 



00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
this is a kilometer-long housing block 



00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that was built in the '70s in Amsterdam. 



00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And here we've broken the 500 apartments



00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
up into small neighborhoods,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and differentiated those neighborhoods. 



00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects, 



00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but what you can see is that 



00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the escalators and elevators

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that circulate people along the face of the building 



00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
are all held up by 



00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
122 structural trusses.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Because we're using escalators



00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to move people,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads. 



00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped 


00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
as you move down the length of the building. 



00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So, working with 


00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Bentley and MicroStation, 


00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we've written a custom piece of software 



00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that networks all of the components together 



00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
into these chunks of information, 



00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
so that if we change any element 



00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
along the length of the building,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
not only does that change distribute 



00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
through each one of the trusses,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but each one of the trusses then distributes that information 



00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
down the length of the entire facade of the building.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So it's a single calculation

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
for every single component of the building


00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that we're adding onto. 


00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So, it's tens of millions of calculations

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel 



00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and another piece of structural steel. 



00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But what it gives us is a harmonic 



00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and synthesized

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
relationship of all these components, one to another. 



00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This idea has, kind of, brought me into doing 



00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
some product design,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and it's because design firms



00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that have connections to architects,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
like, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company, 



00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and Alessi, which is a houseware company.



00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
They saw this actually solving a problem: 



00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
this ability to differentiate components



00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but keep them synthetic.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So, not to pick on BMW, 



00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
or to celebrate them,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
but take BMW as an example. 



00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
They have to, in 2005,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
have a distinct identity 


00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
for all their models of cars. 


00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is, 


00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the 100 series that's coming out, 



00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
has to look like the 700 series,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
at the other end of their product line, 



00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
so they need a distinct, coherent identity, 



00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
which is BMW.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars



00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
for a 300-series car, 



00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and a person paying 70,000 dollars



00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
for a 700 series,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and that person paying more than double 



00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
doesn't want their car to look too much like 


00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the bottom-of-the-market car.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So they have to also discriminate between these products. 



00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So, as manufacturing 



00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
starts to allow more

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
design options,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
this problem gets exacerbated, 



00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
of the whole and the parts.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
is all I think about,



00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but in terms of product design

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. 



00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So, the first kind of test product we did 



00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
was with Alessi,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
which was for a coffee and tea set. 



00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set; 



00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew



00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
down south in San Diego, 



00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and we used an exploded

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
titanium forming method 


00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that's used in the aerospace industry. 



00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Basically what we can do, 


00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
is just cut a graphite mold, 


00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees, 



00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
gently inflate titanium that's soft, 



00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and then explode it at the last minute into this form. 



00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But what's great about it is, 



00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
the forms are only a few hundred dollars. 



00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.



00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So, we designed a system here 



00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
of eight curves that could be swapped,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
very similar to that housing project I showed you, 



00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and we could recombine those together, 



00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
so that we always had ergonomic shapes 



00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that always had the same volume

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and could always be produced in the same way. 



00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with



00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
a few hundred dollars, 



00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and get incredible variation in the components. 



00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And this is one of those examples of the sets. 



00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So, for me, what was important is that 



00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
this coffee set --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
which is just a coffee pot, a teapot, 



00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- 



00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that they would have a coherence --



00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots -- 



00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but that everyone who bought one 



00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way. 



00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
To go back to architecture, 



00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
what's organic about architecture as a field, 



00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
unlike product design, 



00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is this whole issue of holism 



00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and of monumentality is really our realm.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,



00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but also break down into small rooms 



00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and have an identity of both the big scale 


00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and the small scale.


00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Architects tend to work with signature, 



00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
so that an architect needs a signature 



00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and that signature has to work across the scale of houses 



00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
up to, say, skyscrapers,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining



00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and working with; and intricacy, 



00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
which is the relationship of, say, 



00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the shape of a building, its structure, its windows, 



00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
its color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems. 



00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So, my kind of hero for this in the natural world 



00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
are these tropical frogs. 



00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I got interested in them because they're the most 



00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
extreme example

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
of a surface where



00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works -- 



00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
are all intricately connected to one another.



00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So a change in the form 



00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
indicates a change in the color pattern.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing, 



00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
but they really work together and are fused



00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in some way.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So, when doing a center 


00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
for the national parks in Costa Rica, 


00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
we tried to use that idea of a gradient color 



00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and a change in texture

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
as the structure moves across the surface of the building. 



00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We also used a continuity of change 



00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum, 



00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
so it's all one continuous change 



00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in the massing,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.



00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
In a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the different towers of housing fused together 



00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
in shared curves so you get a single mass, 


00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
like a kind of monolith,


00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but it breaks down into individual elements. 



00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And you can see that that change in massing 



00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
also gives all 48 of the apartments 



00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
a unique shape and size,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
but always within a, kind of, controlled limit, 



00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
an envelope of change.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I work with a group of other architects. 



00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We have a company called United Architects. 



00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.



00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And I think this just shows how 



00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
we were approaching

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the problem of incredibly large-scale construction. 



00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral 



00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
around the footprints of the World Trade Center site. 



00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And to do that, we tried to connect up 



00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the five towers into a single system.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And we looked at, from the 1950s on, 


00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
there were numerous examples of other architects 



00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
trying to do the same thing.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We really approached it at the level 



00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
of the typology of the building,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
where we could build these five separate towers, 



00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
but they would all join at the 60th floor 



00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and make a kind of single monolithic mass. 



00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
With United Architects, also, 



00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters 



00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that used the same system, 



00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
but this time in a much more monolithic mass, 



00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
like a sphere.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
But again, you can see this, kind of, 



00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
organic fusion



00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
of multiple building elements

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts, 



00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but in an incredibly organic way. 



00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Finally, I'd like to just show you 



00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
some of the effects of using digital fabrication. 



00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills, 



00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
to just replace, kind of, 



00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models. 



00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And I also bought a laser cutter 



00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and started to fabricate within my own shop, 



00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
kind of, large-scale building elements and models, 



00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
where we could go directly to the tooling. 



00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
What I found out is that the tooling, 



00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
if you intervened in the software, 



00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
actually produced decorative effects. 



00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden, 



00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
or this installation wall in the Netherlands 



00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
at the Netherlands Architecture Institute, 



00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
we could use the texture that the tool would leave 



00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
to produce a lot of the spatial effects, 



00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and we could integrate the texture of the wall 



00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
with the form of the wall with the material. 



00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass, 



00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and then even at the level of structural steel, 



00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
which you think of as being linear and modular. 



00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
The steel industry is so far 



00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
ahead of the design industry

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
that if you take advantage of it 



00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
you can even start to think of beams and columns 



00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
all rolled together into a single system

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
which is highly efficient,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
but also produces decorative effects



00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and formal effects 



00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that are very beautiful and organic.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Thanks very much.
