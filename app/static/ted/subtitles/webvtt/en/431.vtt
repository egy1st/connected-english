00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was listed on the online biography 


00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that said I was a design missionary. 


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's a bit lofty; I'm really more 


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of something like a street walker.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I spend a lot of time in urban areas 


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
looking for design,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and studying design in the public sector. 


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I take about 5,000 photographs a year, 


00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I thought that I would edit from these,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and try to come up with some images 


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that might be appropriate and interesting to you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I used three criteria:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the first was, I thought I'd talk about

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
real design within reach,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
design that's free, not design not quite within reach,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
stuff that was available to all people,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A very common public design done in the '50s.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
very consistent with the Brazilian culture --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I think good design adds to culture.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But I think these are my sort of information highways:

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I live in much more of an analog world,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
where pedestrian traffic and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
interaction and diversity exchange,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and where I think the simple things under our feet

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
have a great amount of meaning to us.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How did I get started in this business?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and just loved utilitarian form --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
simple things that we use every day,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
little compositions of color and surface on form.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a company dealing with simple forms,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
making good designers available to us,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and also selling the personalities and character of the designers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
as well, and it seems to have worked.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A couple of years into the process,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I was there going into the design stores,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and mixing with our crowd of designers,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
has had that in our community also.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and it's getting increasingly more difficult

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to find design that reflects a unique culture.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I recognized, you know, the big story

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it's what's out on the streets,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and maybe it's self-explanatory,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in which people get around and where pedestrian rights

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
are protected.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that I realized that design, that common design,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that's in the public area means a lot to people,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I then kind of thought about the other cities

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
there was something about these important design centers

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is that there are universities and schools

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
where people can't afford cars,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
but it did seem that in many of these areas

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
pedestrian traffic was protected.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and recognized, you know, the first job of design

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is to serve a social purpose.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
but being a very good example of design.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
in the cities, looking at design

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
for common evidence of design

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I was in Buenos Aires very recently,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
He's a Spanish architect and designer.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and it was a bit of a disappointment,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I recognized that oftentimes design,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
when you're set up to see design,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it can be a bit of a letdown.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But there were lots of other things going on in this area:

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it was a kind of construction zone;

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a lot of buildings were going up.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But to me it was an example of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I find these little vignettes,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
these little accidental pieces of design,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to be refreshing.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They give me, I don't know,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
a sense of correctness in the world

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and some visual delight in the knowledge

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that the building will probably never look as good

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
as this simple industrial scaffolding

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that is there to serve.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
going across, these magenta squiggles,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
just a nice, kind of, breakup

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
of the urban place.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And, you know, that no longer exists.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
like listening to little songs or something:

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Antoine Predock designed

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
called Petco Park.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
A terrific use of local materials,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but inside you could find some interior compositions.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I go and see design relationships.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and the way that the trees form vertical elements.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Red is a color in the landscape

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that is often on stop signs.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
it stares back at you the way that a figure might.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Construction site in New York:

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
red having this kind of emotional power

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that's almost an equivalent with the way in which --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
cuteness of puppies and such.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Side street in Italy.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Red drew me into this little composition,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
optimistic to me in the sense that maybe

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the public service's mailbox,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
door service, plumbing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It looks as if these different public services

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
work together to create some nice little compositions.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Simple menus put on a board,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But I'm convinced that it's because

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you're walking around the streets and seeing things.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Color can animate simple blocks,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
simple materials:

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
walking in New York, I'll stop.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I don't always know why I take photographs of things.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
A nice visual composition of symmetry.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Curves against sharp things.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
public seating in the city of New York.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I've come across some other just,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
kind of, curious relationships

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
of bollards on the street that have different interpretations,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but -- these things amuse me.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
a trash can that's been left there for 18 months

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
creates a nice 45-degree angle

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
against these other relationships,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that I see in places that I go.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Havana is a wonderful area.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It's quite free of commercial clutter:

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you don't see our logos and brands and names,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and therefore you're alert to things physically.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
because of the blockades and things,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but a really wonderful playground.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In our area, in furnishings,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
they're sort of way at the top.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I came across this little street in Venice,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where the communist headquarters

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
where they can accept these different ideologies

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and deal with diversity and not have the problem,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
or they can choose to ignore them,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but these -- you don't have warring factions,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
which has made Italy so innovative 


00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and so tolerant.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and I think that it's recognizable there,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and has an important effect on culture,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because their public spaces are protected,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
their sidewalks are protected,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and you're actually able to confront these things

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
physically,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and I think this helps people get over

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
their fear of modernism and other such things.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And I use this -- this is, sort of,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
what I consider to be urban spam.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but here, private industry is really kind of

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
making a mess of the public sector.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the publications that report on problems in the urban area

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
also contribute to it,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and it's just my call to say to all of us,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
public policy won't change this at all;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The extreme might be in Italy where, again,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
there's kind of some type of control

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
over what's happening in the environment is very evident,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I come down and park in this little spot.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And I came down one day,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and all the bikes were red.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,


00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but this was an actual moment

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
when I got off my bike,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and I looked and I thought, it's as if

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
all of my biker brethren

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
had kind of gotten together and conspired

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to make a little statement.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And it reminded me that --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to keep in the present,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to look out for these kinds of things.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It gave me possibilities for wonder --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and create some installations.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But it also reminded me of the power

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
of pattern and repetition

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
to make an effect in our mind.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
than pattern and the way it unites

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
kind of disparate elements.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I was at the art show in Miami in December,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and amazed at the prices of art

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
had created, you know, quite a nice little collage

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
of these car keys,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that I had seen in Tokyo.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And I thought that if

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
pattern can unite these disparate elements,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
it can do just about anything.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I don't have very many shots of people,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
because they kind of 
get in the way of studying pure form.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I was in a small restaurant in Spain,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
having lunch --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
one of those nice days where

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you had the place kind of to yourself,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the culture and the food

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and the quiet, and feeling very lucky,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and a bus load of tourists arrived,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
emptied out,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
filled up the restaurant.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
In a very short period of time,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
completely changed the atmosphere

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and character with loud voices and large bodies and such,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and we had to get up and leave;

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
it was just that uncomfortable.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And at that moment, the sun came out,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and through this perforated screen,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
a pattern was cast over these bodies

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and they kind of faded into the rear,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and we left the restaurant kind of

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
feeling O.K. about stuff.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And I do think pattern

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
has the capability of eradicating

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
some of the most evil

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
forces of society,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
such as bad form in restaurants,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but quite seriously, it was a statement to me

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that one thing that you do, sort of, see

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is the aggressive nature

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
of the industrial world has produced --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
kind of,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
large masses of things,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and when you -- in monoculture,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and I think the preservation of diversity in culture

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
is something that's important to us.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The last shots that I have deal with --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
coming back to this theme of sidewalks,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and I wanted to

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Post-Second World War,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
the influence of the automobile

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in a sort of indiscriminate use.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
as it is on Wal-Mart;

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I'm not going to do that.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But they're real examples in urbanization

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and the change that's occurred in the last number of years,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and the heightened sensitivity to the importance

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
of our urban environments as cultural centers.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I think that they are, that the statements that we make

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in this public sector

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
are our contributions

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to a larger whole.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Cities are the place where we're most likely

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to encounter diversity

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and to mix with other people.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But I think people have recognized

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the sanctity of our urban areas.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
A place like Chicago

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
has really reached kind of a level of international stature.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
enlightened urban planning and renewal,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and I want to single out a place like Chicago,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
for being able to work through the

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
political processes and all that to improve an area.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You would expect a city like this to have

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
upgraded flower boxes

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
but if you actually go along the street you find

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the flower boxes change from street to street:

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
there's actual diversity in the plants.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And the idea that a city group can maintain

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
different types of foliage

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
is really quite exceptional.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and then there are your big-D design statements:

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
My measure of this as being an important bit of design

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
is not so much the way that it looks,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
but the fact that it performs a very important social function.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
There are a lot of free concerts, for example,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that go on in this area;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
it has a phenomenal acoustic system.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But the commitment that the city has made to the public area

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
is significant, and almost an international model.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
on the International Design Council for Mayors,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I thought that I should include at least one

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
shot of technology for you guys.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
has created, kind of,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
a digital readout in this park

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that reflects back

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the characters and personalities

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
of the people in this area.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
reflective of diversity, and I think

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
this marriage of both technology and art

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
in the public sector is an area where the U.S.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
can really take a leadership role,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and Chicago is one example.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Thank you very much.
