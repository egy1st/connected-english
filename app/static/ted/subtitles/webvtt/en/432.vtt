WEBVTT

00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.976
Of the five senses, vision is the one
that I appreciate the most,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.976
and it's the one that I can
least take for granted.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.551
I think this is partially due
to my father, who was blind.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.678
It was a fact that he didn't make
much of a fuss about, usually.

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:17.336
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went
to see a total eclipse of the sun --

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.378
(Laughter)

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.491
Yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:23.339
which may or may not refer
to James Taylor, Warren Beatty

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.195
or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.755
They handed out these dark plastic viewers

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.828
that allowed us to look
directly at the sun

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:31.119
without damaging our eyes.

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:33.879
But Dad got really scared;
he didn't want us doing that.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:36.761
He wanted us instead to use
these cheap cardboard viewers,

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:40.445
so that there was no chance at all
that our eyes would be damaged.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.739
I thought this was
a little strange at the time.

00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:44.231
What I didn't know at the time

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.313
was that my father had actually
been born with perfect eyesight.

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:49.996
When he and his sister Martha
were just very little,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.498
their mom took them out
to see a total eclipse --

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:54.053
or actually, a solar eclipse --

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:57.634
and not long after that, both of them
started losing their eyesight.

00:00:58.382 --> 00:01:01.844
Decades later, it turned out
that the source of their blindness

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:04.676
was most likely some sort
of bacterial infection.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.331
As near as we can tell,
it had nothing whatsoever to do

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.278
with that solar eclipse,

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.970
but by then my grandmother
had already gone to her grave

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:13.423
thinking it was her fault.

00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:17.494
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:18.676
married my mom,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.931
and bought a house
in Lexington, Massachusetts,

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:24.545
where the first shots were fired
against the British in 1775,

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.644
although we didn't actually hit
any of them until Concord.

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:31.242
He got a job working for Raytheon
designing guidance systems,

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.318
which was part of the Route 128
high-tech axis in those days --

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.777
so, the equivalent
of Silicon Valley in the '70s.

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.942
Dad wasn't a real
militaristic kind of guy;

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:43.111
he just felt bad that he wasn't able
to fight in World War II

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.785
on account of his handicap,

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:46.591
although they did let him get through

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:50.352
the several-hour-long army physical exam

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.398
before they got to the very last test,
which was for vision.

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:56.064
(Laughter)

00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:59.239
So Dad started racking
up all of these patents

00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:02.732
and gaining a reputation as a blind
genius, rocket scientist, inventor.

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:06.704
But to us he was just Dad,
and our home life was pretty normal.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:09.238
As a kid, I watched a lot of television

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:12.900
and had lots of nerdy hobbies
like mineralogy and microbiology

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.444
and the space program
and a little bit of politics.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.688
I played a lot of chess.

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:19.855
But at the age of 14, a friend
got me interested in comic books,

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.729
and I decided that was
what I wanted to do for a living.

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:24.930
So, here's my dad:

00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:29.954
he's a scientist, he's an engineer
and he's a military contractor.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:32.654
So, he has four kids, right?

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:34.782
One grows up to become
a computer scientist,

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:36.734
one grows up to join the Navy,

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:39.000
one grows up to become an engineer ...

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.984
And then there's me:
the comic book artist.

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.738
(Laughter)

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:48.450
Which, incidentally, makes me
the opposite of Dean Kamen,

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:50.936
because I'm a comic book artist,
son of an inventor,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.295
and he's an inventor,
son of a comic book artist.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.548
(Laughter)

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:55.735
Right? It's true.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.413
(Applause)

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:00.772
The funny thing is,
Dad had a lot of faith in me.

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:02.948
He had faith in my abilities
as a cartoonist,

00:03:02.972 --> 00:03:06.259
even though he had no direct evidence
that I was any good whatsoever;

00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:07.950
everything he saw was just a blur.

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:10.686
Now, this gives a real meaning
to the term "blind faith,"

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.302
which doesn't have the same
negative connotation for me

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.799
that it does for other people.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.967
Now, faith in things which cannot
be seen, which cannot be proved,

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:21.716
is not the sort of faith that I've ever
really related to all that much.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.167
I tend to like science,

00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:27.678
where what we see and can ascertain
are the foundation of what we know.

00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:30.779
But there's a middle ground, too --

00:03:30.803 --> 00:03:34.358
a middle ground tread by people
like poor old Charles Babbage

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:37.167
and his steam-driven computers
that were never built.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.883
Nobody really understood
what it was that he had in mind

00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:42.400
except for Ada Lovelace,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.268
and he went to his grave
trying to pursue that dream.

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:49.374
Vannevar Bush with his memex --

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:52.375
this idea of all of human
knowledge at your fingertips --

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.927
he had this vision.

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.793
And I think a lot of people in his day

00:03:55.817 --> 00:03:57.756
probably thought he was a bit of a kook.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.195
And, yeah, we can look back
in retrospect and say,

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.440
"Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm --

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:03.487
(Laughter)

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:06.597
But that's not the point;
he understood the shape of the future.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:11.211
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions
for computer-human interaction.

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:14.104
Same thing: he understood
the shape of the future,

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:17.730
even though it was something
that would only be implemented

00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:19.145
by people much later.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.888
Or Paul Baran, and his vision
for packet switching.

00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:24.069
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.

00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:26.963
Or even the people
who actually pulled it off,

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:29.597
the people at Bolt, Beranek
and Newman in Boston,

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.533
who just would sketch out these structures

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:35.093
of what would eventually
become a worldwide network,

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:38.735
and sketching things on the back
of napkins and on note papers

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.057
and arguing over dinner
at Howard Johnson's --

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.471
on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.728
just two miles from where I was studying
the Queen's Gambit Deferred

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:48.852
and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:51.044
singing "Midnight Train to Georgia" --

00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:52.071
(Laughter)

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.937
in my dad's big easy chair, you know?

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.898
So, three types of vision, right?

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:58.899
Vision based on what one cannot see,

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.692
the vision of that unseen and unknowable.

00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:05.176
The vision of that which has already
been proven or can be ascertained.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.725
And this third kind, a vision of something
which can be, which may be,

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:14.751
based on knowledge
but is, as yet, unproven.

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:17.531
Now, we've seen a lot
of examples of people

00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:19.873
who are pursuing
that sort of vision in science,

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:22.851
but I think it's also true
in the arts, it's true in politics,

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.063
it's even true in personal endeavors.

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:27.736
What it comes down to, really,
is four basic principles:

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.959
learn from everyone;

00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:30.309
follow no one;

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.218
watch for patterns;

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.838
and work like hell.

00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:36.882
I think these are the four principles
that go into this.

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.737
And it's that third one, especially,

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:41.902
where visions of the future
begin to manifest themselves.

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:45.804
What's interesting is that this particular
way of looking at the world,

00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.960
is, I think, only one
of four different ways

00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:50.700
that manifest themselves
in different fields of endeavor.

00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:55.207
In comics, I know that it results
in sort of a formalist attitude

00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:57.290
towards trying to understand how it works.

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:59.545
Then there's another,
more classical attitude

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.152
which embraces beauty and craft;

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:06.208
another one which believes
in the pure transparency of content;

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:10.179
and then another, which emphasizes
the authenticity of human experience

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.621
and honesty and rawness.

00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:14.449
These are four very different ways
of looking at the world.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:15.625
I even gave them names:

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.396
the classicist, the animist,
the formalist and iconoclast.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.960
Interestingly, they seem
to correspond more or less

00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:23.555
to Jung's four subdivisions
of human thought.

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.367
And they reflect a dichotomy
of art and delight

00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.606
on left and the right;

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.130
tradition and revolution
on the top and the bottom.

00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:32.797
And if you go on the diagonal,
you get content and form,

00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:34.062
and then beauty and truth.

00:06:34.086 --> 00:06:38.172
And it probably applies just as much
to music and movies and fine art,

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:41.173
which has nothing whatsoever
to do with vision at all,

00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:44.078
or, for that matter, nothing to do
with our conference theme

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:45.434
of "Inspired by Nature,"

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:48.138
except to the extent
of the fable of the frog

00:06:48.162 --> 00:06:51.430
who gives a ride to the scorpion
on his back to get across the river

00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:53.664
because the scorpion
promises not to sting him,

00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:56.222
but the scorpion stings him anyway
and they both die,

00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:59.135
but not before the frog asks
him why, and the scorpion says,

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.358
"Because it's my nature."

00:07:00.382 --> 00:07:01.537
In that sense, yes.

00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:04.906
(Laughter)

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.160
So this was my nature.

00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:09.298
The thing was, I saw that the route I took

00:07:09.322 --> 00:07:13.167
to discovering this focus in my work

00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.035
and who I was --

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.286
I saw it as just this road to discovery.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.533
Actually, it was just me
embracing my nature,

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:24.403
which means that I didn't actually fall
that far from the tree, after all.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.075
So what does a "scientific mind"
do in the arts?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.931
I started making comics, but I also
started trying to understand them,

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.106
almost immediately.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.212
One of the most important things
about comics that I discovered

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:40.083
was that comics are a visual medium,

00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:42.951
but they try to embrace
all of the senses within it.

00:07:43.073 --> 00:07:47.140
So, the different elements
of comics, like pictures and words,

00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:49.682
and the different symbols
and everything in between

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:50.893
that comics presents,

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:53.485
are all funneled through
the single conduit, a vision.

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.486
So we have things like resemblance,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.750
where something which resembles
the physical world can be abstracted

00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:00.536
in a couple of different directions:

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.160
abstracted from resemblance,
but still retaining the complete meaning,

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.901
or abstracted away
from both resemblance and meaning

00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:08.181
towards the picture plane.

00:08:08.205 --> 00:08:11.039
Put all these three together,
and you have a nice little map

00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:13.178
of the entire boundary
of visual iconography,

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:14.987
which comics can embrace.

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:17.849
And if you move to the right
you also get language,

00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:20.850
because that's abstracting
even further from resemblance,

00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:22.874
but still maintaining meaning.

00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:26.227
Vision is called upon to represent sound

00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:29.822
and to understand
the common properties of those two

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:31.986
and their common heritage as well;

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.395
also, to try to represent
the texture of sound

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.135
to capture its essential
character through visuals.

00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:43.243
There's also a balance between the visible
and the invisible in comics.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.056
Comics is a kind of call and response,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.222
in which the artist gives you something
to see within the panels,

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:52.248
and then gives you something
to imagine between the panels.

00:08:53.025 --> 00:08:57.290
Also, another sense
which comics' vision represents,

00:08:57.314 --> 00:08:58.599
and that's time.

00:08:58.984 --> 00:09:01.901
Sequence is a very important
aspect of comics.

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:04.763
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:09.582
And this temporal map was something
that energizes modern comics,

00:09:09.606 --> 00:09:12.527
but I was wondering
if perhaps it also energizes

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:14.069
other sorts of forms,

00:09:14.093 --> 00:09:15.525
and I found some in history.

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:19.290
You can see this same principle operating

00:09:19.314 --> 00:09:22.298
in these ancient versions
of the same idea.

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.475
What's happening is,

00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:25.841
an art form is colliding
with a given technology,

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.206
whether it's paint on stone,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.627
like the Tomb of Menna the Scribe
in ancient Egypt,

00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:32.255
or a bas-relief sculpture
rising up a stone column,

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.307
or a 200-foot-long embroidery,

00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:36.308
or painted deerskin and tree bark

00:09:36.332 --> 00:09:38.770
running across 88 accordion-folded pages.

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:40.959
What's interesting is,
once you hit "print" --

00:09:40.983 --> 00:09:42.840
and this is from 1450, by the way --

00:09:42.864 --> 00:09:45.997
all of the artifacts of modern comics
start to present themselves:

00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:47.537
rectilinear panel arrangements,

00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:49.329
simple line drawings without tone,

00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:51.351
and a left-to-right reading sequence.

00:09:52.763 --> 00:09:57.771
And within 100 years, you already start
to see word balloons and captions,

00:09:57.795 --> 00:10:00.756
and it's really just a hop, skip
and a jump from here to here.

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:04.944
So I wrote a book about this in '93,
but as I was finishing the book,

00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:06.884
I had to do a little bit of typesetting,

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:09.576
and I was tired of going
to my local copy shop to do it,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.845
so I bought a computer.

00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:12.543
And it was just a little thing --

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:14.733
it wasn't good for much
except text entry --

00:10:14.757 --> 00:10:18.597
but my father had told me
about Moore's law back in the '70s,

00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:20.098
and I knew what was coming.

00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:23.247
And so, I kept my eyes peeled

00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:25.312
to see if the sort
of changes that happened

00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:27.946
when we went from pre-print
comics to print comics

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.844
would happen when we went beyond,
to post-print comics.

00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.083
So, one of the first things proposed

00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:35.461
was that we could mix
the visuals of comics

00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:38.296
with the sound, motion
and interactivity of the CD-ROMs

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.526
being made in those days.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.129
This was even before the Web.

00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:43.114
And one of the first things they did was,

00:10:43.138 --> 00:10:45.049
they tried to take the comics page as is

00:10:45.073 --> 00:10:46.533
and transplant it to monitors,

00:10:46.557 --> 00:10:48.558
which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.081
of appropriating the shape
of the previous technology

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:53.166
as the content of the new technology.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.670
And so, what they would do
is have these comic pages

00:10:55.694 --> 00:10:57.329
that resemble print comics pages,

00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:59.769
and they would introduce
all this sound and motion.

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:03.034
The problem was that if you go
with this basic idea

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.406
that space equals time in comics,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.145
what happens is that
when you introduce sound and motion,

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:11.568
which are temporal phenomena
that can only be represented through time,

00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:15.896
they break with that continuity
of presentation.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.362
Interactivity was another thing.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.153
There were hypertext comics,
but the thing about hypertext

00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:23.886
is that everything in hypertext
is either here, not here,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.068
or connected to here;

00:11:25.092 --> 00:11:26.442
it's profoundly nonspatial.

00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:28.919
The distance from Abraham Lincoln
to a Lincoln penny

00:11:28.943 --> 00:11:32.028
to Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan
to "Plan 9" to nine lives:

00:11:32.052 --> 00:11:33.203
it's all the same.

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:34.420
(Laughter)

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.296
But in comics,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.190
every aspect of the work,
every element of the work,

00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:43.349
has a spatial relationship
to every other element at all times.

00:11:43.373 --> 00:11:44.541
So the question was:

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:47.542
Was there any way to preserve
that spatial relationship

00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:49.914
while still taking advantage
of all of the things

00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:51.581
that digital had to offer us?

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:53.636
And I found my personal answer for this

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.970
in those ancient comics
that I was showing you.

00:11:55.994 --> 00:11:59.334
Each of them has a single
unbroken reading line,

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:03.051
whether it's going zigzag across the walls
or spiraling up a column

00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:04.603
or just straight left to right,

00:12:04.627 --> 00:12:08.676
or even going in a backwards zigzag
across those 88 accordion-folded pages,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.094
the same thing is happening;

00:12:10.118 --> 00:12:12.904
that is, that the basic idea
that as you move through space

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:14.083
you move through time,

00:12:14.107 --> 00:12:16.191
is being carried out
without any compromise,

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.246
but there were compromises when print hit.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.186
Adjacent spaces were no longer
adjacent moments,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.429
so the basic idea of comics
was being broken again and again

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:25.609
and again and again.

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:27.959
And I thought, OK, well, if that's true,

00:12:27.983 --> 00:12:30.890
is there any way,
when we go beyond today's print,

00:12:30.914 --> 00:12:32.674
to somehow bring that back?

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:39.302
Now, the monitor is just as limited
as the page, technically, right?

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.453
It's a different shape,
but other than that,

00:12:41.477 --> 00:12:43.382
it's the same basic limitation.

00:12:43.406 --> 00:12:46.406
But that's only if you look
at the monitor as a page,

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:49.329
but not if you look
at the monitor as a window.

00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:50.938
And that's what I propose,

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:54.079
that perhaps we could create
these comics on an infinite canvas,

00:12:54.103 --> 00:12:57.013
along the X axis and the Y axis

00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.297
and staircases.

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:01.740
We could do circular narratives
that were literally circular.

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:04.826
We could do a turn in a story
that was literally a turn.

00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:07.642
Parallel narratives
could be literally parallel.

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:10.694
X, Y and also Z.

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:13.561
So I had all these notions.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.093
This was back in the late '90s,

00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:17.948
and other people in my business
thought I was pretty crazy,

00:13:17.972 --> 00:13:20.497
but a lot of people then went on
and actually did it.

00:13:20.521 --> 00:13:22.244
I'm going to show you a couple now.

00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:26.275
This was an early collage comic
by a fellow named Jasen Lex.

00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:31.411
And notice what's going on here.

00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:33.955
What I'm searching for
is a durable mutation --

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.956
that's what all of us are searching for.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.160
As media head into this new era,

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.676
we are looking for mutations
that are durable,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.293
that have some sort of staying power.

00:13:45.237 --> 00:13:49.341
Now, we're taking this basic idea
of presenting comics in a visual medium,

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:52.676
and we're carrying it through all the way
from beginning to end.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.871
That's that entire comic you just saw,
up on the screen right now.

00:13:55.895 --> 00:13:58.954
But even though we're only experiencing it
one piece at a time,

00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:01.560
that's just where
the technology is right now.

00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:03.322
As the technology evolves,

00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:06.330
as you get full immersive
displays and whatnot,

00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:09.124
this sort of thing
will only grow; it will adapt.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:14.701
It will adapt to its environment;
it's a durable mutation.

00:14:14.725 --> 00:14:15.890
Here's another one.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:18.211
This is by Drew Weing; this is called

00:14:18.235 --> 00:14:21.250
"'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death
of the Universe."

00:14:46.062 --> 00:14:47.554
See what's going on here

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:51.579
as we draw these stories
on an infinite canvas

00:14:53.835 --> 00:14:58.983
is you're creating a more pure expression
of what this medium is all about.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.233
We'll go by this a little quickly.
You get the idea.

00:15:06.257 --> 00:15:08.257
I just want to get to the last panel.

00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:17.141
[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup!
Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]

00:15:17.165 --> 00:15:18.228
(Laughter)

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:19.852
[Pup: Did either of you realize

00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:23.171
that eventually the universe
will be nothing but a thin, cold gas

00:15:23.195 --> 00:15:25.155
spread across infinite, lonely space?]

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:27.801
[Cat 1: Oh ...
Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:29.825
(Laughter)

00:15:31.517 --> 00:15:32.667
Just one more.

00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:37.089
Talk about your infinite canvas.

00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:39.900
It's by a guy named
Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.

00:15:40.263 --> 00:15:41.660
Why is this important?

00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:45.231
I think this is important because media --

00:15:46.397 --> 00:15:47.739
all media --

00:15:47.763 --> 00:15:50.074
provide us a window back into our world.

00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:54.890
Now, it could be that motion pictures
and eventually, virtual reality,

00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:58.093
or something equivalent to it,
some sort of immersive display,

00:15:58.117 --> 00:16:02.234
is going to provide us
with our most efficient escape

00:16:02.258 --> 00:16:03.676
from the world that we're in.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.480
That's why most people turn
to storytelling, to escape.

00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:12.897
But media provides us with a window
back into the world we live in.

00:16:13.255 --> 00:16:16.398
And when media evolve

00:16:16.422 --> 00:16:21.399
so that the identity of the media
becomes increasingly unique --

00:16:21.423 --> 00:16:24.623
because what you're looking at
is comics cubed,

00:16:24.647 --> 00:16:27.022
you're looking at comics
that are more comics-like

00:16:27.046 --> 00:16:28.641
than they've ever been before --

00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:31.317
when that happens, you provide
people with multiple ways

00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:35.319
of reentering the world
through different windows.

00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:39.110
And when you do that, it allows them
to triangulate the world they live in

00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:40.509
and see its shape.

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.310
That's why I think this is important.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.389
One of many reasons,
but I've got to go now.

00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:45.563
Thank you for having me.
