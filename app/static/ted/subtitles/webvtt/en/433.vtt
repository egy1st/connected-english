00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and it's made with a new technique

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that I've been playing around with,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we call the epoxy method.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I call it an epoxy method because --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's not very appetizing. I understand that --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but -- but

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's two resins that are, sort of,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but when you put the two together,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
something happens. A bond takes place,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and you get this very strong, powerful

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
adhesive.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, in this technique,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
what I've tried to do is kind of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the artisan bread-baking community,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and put it together to come up with a method

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that would help to take whole-grain breads.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We finally, after 40 years of knowing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that wholegrain was a healthier option,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and attempting to actually eat them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you know, how do you make it taste good?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So a baker, and a good baker,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
knows how to pull or draw forth

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for the bran is fiber.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's got germ. Those are the good things,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So whole grain breads historically

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and people don't like to eat,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but when we think of something as a health food,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
not out of passion and love for the flavor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is to deliver flavor.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And -- and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So, this is the challenge for this bread.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We're going to try this at lunch, and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'll explain a bit more about it,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is to make a piece of dough

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the day before that is not leavened.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's just dough that is wet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that helps to start enzyme activity.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that brings out flavor.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's what enzymes are doing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And so, if we can release some of those,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they become accessible to us in our palate.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They become accessible to the yeast as food.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to give us a beautiful crust.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The other pre-dough

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and that starts to develop flavor also.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And we're hoping that, sort of, the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
enzyme piece of dough

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we can create a bread that does evoke

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And this is what every student has to begin with.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Everything in its place. First stage.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We have to develop the gluten.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because we've got glutenin and gliadin,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so we, in the mixing process,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
have to develop the gluten,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
which is really where the flavor develops. 



00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's yeast burps and sweat.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And somehow, this is transformed --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is that it is a transformational food,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and we're going to explore that in a minute.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But then, quickly through the next few stages.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We, after it's fermented and it's developed,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
started to develop flavor and character,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we divide it into smaller units.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That's called "rounding."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Then we go into final shaping,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then, stage nine.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We call it "proofing."

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Three transformations take place in the oven.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They give us that beautiful brown crust.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Inside, the proteins --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
this gluten -- coagulates.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
When it gets to about 160 degrees,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the proteins all line up 
and they create structure,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the gluten structure --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
gelatinize.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And gelatinization is yet another

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
oven transformation.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
sweat, burps and starch guts.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
because what went into the oven as dough

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
comes out in stage 11 as bread.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And stage 11, we call it cooling --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
because we never really eat the bread right away.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
There's a little carry-over baking.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but my students call "eating."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and in a few minutes we will try this,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and see if we have succeeded

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because I really believe that

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
all things can be understood --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that all things can be understood on four levels:

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the political or ethical level.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
unless you first understand the literal level,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
so that's why we're talking literally about bread.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But let's kind of look at these stages again

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
all in my quest for answering the question,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
"What is it about bread that's so special?"

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Because what happens is,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
bread begins as wheat or any other grain.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that grows in the field.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We harvest the wheat,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and in harvesting it, we kill it.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, wheat is alive,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We can plant those in the ground.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we save some of those for the next generation.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But most of those seeds get crushed

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and turned into flour.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's not only been killed,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So we turn it into flour.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The first transformation -- and, by the way,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the definition of transformation for me is

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
a radical change from one thing into something else.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Not like hot water made cold,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or cold water turned hot,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but water boiled off and becoming steam.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
That's a transformation, two different things.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Well, in this case, the first transformation

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is alive to dead.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I'd call that radical.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So, we've got now this flour.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And what do we do? We add some water.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
In stage one, we weigh it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and we create something that we call "clay."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
It's like clay.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And we infuse that clay

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
with an ingredient that we call "leaven."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
to vivify, to bring to life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
You see, the baker, in this moment,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
has become, in a sense,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And we know it's alive because in stage three,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
it grows. Growth is the proof of life.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And while it's growing, all these

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
literal transformations are taking place.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Yeast is eating sugar and

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
turning them into acids.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough



00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
under the watchful gaze of the baker.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And the baker's choices all along the way

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
determine the outcome of the product.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and ingredients. That's the art of baking.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So all these things are determined by the baker,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is divided into smaller units, and each of those units

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
are given shape by the baker.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And as they're shaped, they're raised again,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
all along proving that they're alive,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and developing character.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
a few people do, I think, but not too many.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I've met some dough eaters, but --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But dough is what we're working with,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and we take that dough to the oven,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
crosses the threshold of 140 degrees,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it passes what we call the "thermal death point."

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to enliven it, to vivify it,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in order to complete its mission,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
which is also to turn this dough into bread,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
has to give up its life.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's starting to make sense to me --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
what goes in is dough,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
what comes out is bread --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
or it goes in alive,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
comes out dead.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Third transformation, alive to dead --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but dough to bread.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Or another analogy would be,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And it's what comes out of the oven

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that is what we call the staff of life.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
This is the product

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's so

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
deeply embedded in our psyches that

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
bread is used as a symbol for life.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's used as a symbol for transformation.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
again completing the life cycle,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and have opportunities to ponder

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
things like this.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So this is what I've learned from bread.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And what we're going to attempt to do

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
with this bread here, again,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is to use, in addition to everything we talked about,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Beer is basically liquid bread,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
or bread is solid beer.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
(Laughter)

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
But we've got this bread,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and what I did here is to try to, again,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
evoke even more flavor from this grain,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
by using sprouting and malting and roasting.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but now fiber on top of fiber.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And so this is, again, hopefully

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
not only a healthy bread,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
but a bread that you will enjoy.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, if I, kind of, break this bread,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
maybe we can share this now a little bit here.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We'll start a little piece here,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and I'm going to take a little piece here --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I'll leave you

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with what I call the baker's blessing.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
May your crust be crisp,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and your bread always rise.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Thank you.
