00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in the very fabric of the modern economy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because in the beginning were commodities.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then you extract them out of the ground,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and sell them on the open marketplace.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that lasted for millennia.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But then along came the industrial revolution,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where we used commodities as a raw material

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to be able to make or manufacture goods.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is that goods have become commoditized.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where people don't care who makes them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They just care about three things and three things only:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
price, price and price.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that is customization.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My first book was called "Mass Customization" --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it came up a couple of times yesterday --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and how I discovered this progression of economic value

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
was realizing that customizing a good

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
automatically turned it into a service,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
because it was done just for a particular person,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
because it wasn't inventoried,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it was delivered on demand to that individual person.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
services are being commoditized as well.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but services as well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What that means is that it's time

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to move to a new level of economic value.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Time to go beyond the goods and the services,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then you can't help but make them go "wow";

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you can't help but turn it into an experience.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So we're shifting to an experience economy,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now most places that I talk to,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the world's premier experience-stager.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the experience capital of the world.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But here, when you think about experiences,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Think about meaningful places.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Think about drinking wine,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The experience capital in the world of conferences.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
All of these are experiences.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and particularly in the Netherlands,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
almost invariably.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And the question isn't really so much a question

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as an accusation.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And the Dutch, when they usually put it,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it always starts with the same two words.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You know the words I mean?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You Americans.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They say, you Americans.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You like your fantasy environments,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
your fake, your Disneyland experiences.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They say, we Dutch, we like real,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
natural, authentic experiences.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is: I point out that first of all,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you have to understand that there is no such thing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as an inauthentic experience.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
then every experience we have is authentic.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
stimuli for the experience,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
there is a company that manufactured the car

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that delivered you to the edge of the woods;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in case you get lost in the woods.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Right? All of those are man-made,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
artificiality brought into the woods by you,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and by the very nature of being there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And then I always finish off

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
particularly coming from the Dutch,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is that the Netherlands

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And the Dutch, they always go ...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they realize, I'm right!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
or otherwise moved, modified and manicured

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to look as if it had always been there.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughter)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but everyone has this desire for the authentic.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And authenticity is therefore

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
becoming the new consumer sensibility --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the buying criteria by which consumers

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
are choosing who are they going to buy from,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and what they're going to buy.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Becoming the basis of the economy.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that each one has their own business imperative,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
matched with a consumer sensibility.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's about supply and availability.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Getting the commodities to market.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
getting the costs down as low as possible

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so we can offer them to the masses.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
With the service economy, it is about

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
improving quality.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And now, with the experience economy,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
it's about rendering authenticity.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as business people --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to percieve your offerings as authentic.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Because there is a basic paradox:

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
no one can have an inauthentic experience,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but no business can supply one.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
all business is a matter of using machinery,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and all those things make something inauthentic.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So, how do you render authenticity,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
is the question.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Are you rendering authenticity?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
When you think about that, let me go back to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
points to as the seminal point

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
at which authenticity entered the lexicon,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
if you will.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and in his play, Hamlet.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
says something profoundly real.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
At the end of a laundry list of advice

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
he's giving to his son, Laertes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
he says this:

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And this above all: to thine own self be true.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And it doth follow, as night the day,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that thou canst not then be false to any man.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There are two dimensions to authenticity:

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Two, is other-directed:

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
being what you say you are to others.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
All right? Anybody else like that, no?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
a two-by-two.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
are they true to themselves?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And the other dimension is:

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are they what they say they are to others?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
If not, you have,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
yielding a two-by-two matrix.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And of course, if you are both true to yourself,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and are what you say you are, then you're real real!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
All right, now, there is value for fake.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
There will always be companies around to supply the fake,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
because there will always be desire for the fake.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
if you do like it, it's faux.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Now, the other two sides of the coin are:

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
being a real fake --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
is what it says it is,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but is not true to itself,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
or being a fake real:

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
is true to itself, but not what it says it is.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You can contrast them by thinking about

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Universal City Walk versus

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Disney World, or Disneyland.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Universal City Walk is a real fake --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in fact, we got this very term

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
right, because you can see behind the facade, right?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
outside in this city.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But is it really true to itself?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Right? Is it really in the city?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Is it --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you can see behind all of it,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and see what is going on in the facades of it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So she calls it a real fake.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
or a fake reality.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Laughter)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
(Laughter)

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
-- sorry.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
When you are there you are just immersed

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in this wonderful environment.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, it's a fake real.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now the easiest way

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to fall down in this,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and not be real real,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is not to understand your heritage,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and thereby repudiate that heritage.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So, you have to understand that past.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Think about Disney again.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Disney,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
10 or 15 years ago, right,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the Disney -- the company that is probably

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
best-known for family values out there,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Disney bought the ABC network.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
as the T&amp;A network, right --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that's not too much jargon, is it?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Right, the T&amp;A network. Then it bought Miramax,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
known for its NC-17 fare,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and all of a sudden, families everywhere

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It was no longer true to its heritage;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
no longer true to Walt Disney.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Because it is no longer true to itself.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is that they advertise

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
things that they are not.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
advertizing things that you're not.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Think about any hotel, any airline,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
any hospital.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
(Laughter)

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Then you have that perception that you are phony.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
is to provide places for people to experience

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
who you are.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
For people to experience who you are.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Right, it's not advertising does it.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
That's why you have companies like Starbucks,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
right, that doesn't advertise at all.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And think about the economic value they have provided

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
by that experience.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
when you treat it as a good.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Take that same good,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
you get 50 cents, maybe a buck

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
per cup of coffee.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
But surround the brewing of that coffee

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
with the ambiance of a Starbucks,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and now, because of that authentic experience,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
you can charge two, three, four, five dollars

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
for a cup of coffee.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, authenticity is becoming

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the new consumer sensibility.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
with three rules, three basic rules.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
One, don't say you're authentic

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
unless you really are authentic.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Two, it's easier to be authentic

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
if you don't say you're authentic.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And three, if you say you're authentic,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
you better be authentic.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
what we -- what will make us happy,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
is spending our time and our money

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
satisfying the desire for authenticity.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Thank you.
