00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My work is play.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I play when I design.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that I actually do that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the definition of play,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
number one, was engaging in a childlike

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
activity or endeavor,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and number two was gambling.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I realize I do both

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when I'm designing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I think that if you're not,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there's probably something inherently wrong

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with the structure or the situation you're in,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
if you're a designer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But the serious part is what threw me,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I couldn't quite get a handle

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
on it until I remembered an essay.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It was written by Russell Baker,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this essay,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or an excerpt from it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because it really hit home for me.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here is a letter of friendly advice.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Be serious, it says.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Being solemn is easy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Being serious is hard.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Children almost always begin by being serious,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is what makes them so entertaining

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
when compared with adults as a class.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
like Adlai Stevenson,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's because it is hard for most people

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to recognize seriousness, which is rare,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
which is commonplace.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Jogging, which is commonplace,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Poker is serious.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Washington, D.C. is solemn.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
New York is serious.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
about the future is solemn.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Taking a long walk by yourself,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is serious.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of solemnity or seriousness to design,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Solemn design is often important and very effective design.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Solemn design is also socially correct,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and is accepted by appropriate audiences.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's what right-thinking designers

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and all the clients are striving for.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Serious design, serious play,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is something else.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For one thing, it often happens

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
spontaneously, intuitively,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
accidentally or incidentally.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
parts of human behavior that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
don't really make any sense.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Serious design is imperfect.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the first of its kind.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
from the solemn point of view.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's because the art of serious play

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Perfection happens during solemn play.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, I always saw design careers

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
like surreal staircases.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If you look at the staircase, you'll see

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that in your 20s the risers are very high

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and the steps are very short,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and you make huge discoveries.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and so that anything you do is a learning experience

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and you're just jumping right up there.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
As you get older, the risers get shallower

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and the steps get wider,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and you start moving along at a slower pace

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because you're making fewer discoveries.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And as you get older and more decrepit,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you sort of inch along on this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
sort of depressing, long staircase,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
leading you into oblivion.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(Laughter)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And in my 35 years of working experience,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I think I was really serious four times.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I'm going to show them to you now,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
because they came out of very specific conditions.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's great to be a kid.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Now, when I was in my early 20s,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and I had no idea what a great job I had.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I thought everybody had a job like that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And what --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
what was going on around me

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and the things that came at the time I walked into design

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
were the enemy.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I really, really, really hated

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the typeface Helvetica.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I thought the typeface Helvetica

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
really repressive typeface,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And when I was in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
my college days,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
this was the sort of design

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that was fashionable and popular.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and I made parodies about it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So -- so, my goal in life

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the early 70s. There weren't --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You had to go places and find the stuff.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And what I responded to was, you know,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Art Nouveau, or deco,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or Victorian typography,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
or things that were just completely not Helvetica.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I taught myself design this way,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and this was sort of my early years,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and I used these things

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in really goofy ways

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
on record covers and in my design.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I wasn't educated. I just sort of

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
put these things together.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I made these very lush,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
very elaborate record covers,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because I didn't know what those things were.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I just hated Helvetica.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(Laughter)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And that kind of passion

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
drove me into very serious play,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a kind of play I could never do now

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because I'm too well-educated.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And there's something wonderful about

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that form of youth,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
where you can let yourself

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
grow and play, and be

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
really a brat, and then accomplish things.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
By the end of the '70s, actually,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the stuff became known.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I mean, these covers appeared all over the world,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and they started winning awards,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and people knew them.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And I was suddenly a post-modernist,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and I began a career as -- in my own business.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I didn't do what I think

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
turning out these sorts of designs

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that I was expected to do

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
because that's who I was,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, here was the second condition

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
for which I think I accomplished some serious play.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
There's a Paul Newman movie

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that I love called "The Verdict."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And in the movie, he plays

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a down-and-out lawyer

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
who's become an ambulance chaser.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And he's taken on --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
he's given, actually -- a malpractice suit to handle

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that's sort of an easy deal,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and in the midst of trying to connect the deal,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
he starts to empathize

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and identify with his client,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and he regains his morality and purpose,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and he goes on to win the case.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And in the depth of despair,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and he needs this case,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
he needs to win this case so badly.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There's a shot of Paul Newman alone,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in his office, saying,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
"This is the case. There are no other cases.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is the case. There are no other cases."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And in that moment of

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
desire and focus,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
he can win.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And that is a wonderful

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
position to be in to create some serious play.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And I had that moment in 1994

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
when I met a theater director

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
named George Wolfe,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
who was going to have me design

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
then known,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and then became the Public Theater.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I began getting immersed

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in this project

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in a way I never was before.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
They had no logo and no identity,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but they had these very iconic posters

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
painted by Paul Davis.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And George Wolf had taken over from another director

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and he wanted to change the theater,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and he wanted to make it urban and loud

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and a place that was inclusive.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So, drawing on my love of typography,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I immersed myself into this project.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And what was different about it was the totality of it,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in a way I had never done before,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
where every aspect --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
was designed by me.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
There was no format.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I literally for three years made everything --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
every scrap of paper, everything online,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that this theater did.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And it was the only job,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
even though I was doing other jobs.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with a client since.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It enabled me to really express myself and grow.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And I think that you know

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
when you're going to be given this position,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
it's the moment of serious play.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I did these things, and I still do them.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I still work for the Public Theater.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I'm on their board, and

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I still am involved with it.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
two years after I designed it,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
which was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that was all over New York.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But something happened to it, and what happened to it was,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
it became very popular.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And that is a kiss of death for something serious

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
because it makes it solemn.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And what happened was

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that New York City, to a degree,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
ate my identity

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
because people began to copy it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Here's an ad in the New York Times

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
which meant I had to change it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, I changed it so that every season was different,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and I continued to do these posters,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
but they never had the seriousness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
of the first identity

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of everything being the same thing.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I must have done more than a dozen

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
cultural identities for major institutions,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and I don't think I ever -- I ever

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
grasped that seriousness again --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I do them for very big, important institutions

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
in New York City.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The institutions are solemn,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and so is the design.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and they spend more money on them, but I think

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that that moment comes and goes.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The best way to accomplish serious design --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
which I think we all have the opportunity to do --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
That doesn't happen very often,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but it happened to me in the year 2000,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
when for some reason or another,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a whole pile of different architects

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
started to ask me to design

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
the insides of theaters with them,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'd never done this kind of work before.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I didn't know what they were talking about,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a single job -- could go on for four years

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
because I was used to immediacy in graphic design,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and that kind of attention to detail

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
but I fell in love with this process

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
of actually integrating graphics into architecture

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
New Yorkers look at their feet.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And then I found that actors and actresses

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
actually take their cues from the floor,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
began to make sense.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
They ran around corners,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
they went up sides of buildings,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they melded into the architecture.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and backlit with fiber optics.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And the architect, Jim Polshek,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
essentially gave me a canvas

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to play typography out on.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And it was serious play.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
made out of completely inexpensive materials.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Things I never did before, built before.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And then, inexpensive signage.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
(Laughter)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I think my favorite of these

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
was this little job in Newark, New Jersey.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It's a performing arts school.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is the building that -- they had no money,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and they had to recast it, and they said,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
if we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Well, I think we can paint it.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And we did. And it was play.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And there's the building. Everything was painted --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
typography over the whole damn thing,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
including the air conditioning ducts.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I hired guys who paint flats

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
fixed on the sides of garages

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to do the painting on the building, and they loved it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They used to climb up on the building and call me

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and tell me that they had to correct my typography --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and they did wonderful things with it.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
They were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
my work had begun to become accepted.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
People wanted it in big, expensive places.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And that began to make it solemn.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Bloomberg was all about numbers,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and we did big numbers through the space

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But it became the end

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
of the seriousness of the play,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and it started to, once again, become solemn.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
This is a current project

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
where I got to be goofy.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I was invited to design

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So I had to actually give a presentation

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
to a city council

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and neighborhood constituents,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
"You know, really what you have here

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
are all these underpasses

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So I began doing this crazy presentation

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
of these installations --

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
potential installations -- on

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
these underpass bridges,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and stood up in front of the city council --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and was a little bit scared,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I have to admit.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and so utterly ridiculous,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and ignored the brief so desperately

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
just completely because it was so goofy to begin with.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And this is the bridge they're actually

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
painting up and preparing as we speak.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It will change every six months, and it will become an art installation

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
in the North Side of Pittsburgh,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and it will probably become a landmark in the area.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
John Hockenberry told you a bit about

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
my travail with Citibank,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
that is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And I actually am amused by them and like them,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
they actually keep their graphics very nice.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I drew the logo for Citibank

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
on a napkin in the first meeting.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
That was the play part of the job.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And then I spent a year

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
going to long, tedious,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
boring meetings,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
trying to sell this logo through

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
to a huge corporation

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to the point of tears.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We made idiotic presentations

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
showing how the Citi logo made sense,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and how it was really derived from an umbrella,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and we made animations of these things,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and it played out on such a grand scale,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and it's so internationally recognizable,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
As a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
until Fallon put it on

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
its very good "Live Richly" campaign,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and then everybody accepted it all over the world.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So during this time I needed

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
some kind of counterbalance

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
for this crazy, crazy existence

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
of going to these long, idiotic meetings.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And I was up in my country house,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and for some reason, I began painting

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
these very big, very involved,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
laborious, complicated

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
maps of the entire world,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and completely controlling the information,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and going totally and completely nuts with it.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
They would take me about six months initially,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
but then I started getting faster at it.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Here's the United States.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Every single city of the United States is on here.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And it hung for about eight months

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
at the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and they would point to a part of the map

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
and they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
(Laughter)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
But what I liked about it was,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I was controlling my own idiotic information,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
and I was creating my own palette of information,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and I was totally and completely

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
at play.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
One of my favorites was

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
that has the election results rolling around in the water.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I keep that for evidence.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
(Laughter)

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Somebody

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
was up at my house and saw the paintings

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
and recommended them to a gallery,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and I had a first show

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
about two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
that I'm showing you now.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And then a funny thing happened -- they sold.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And they sold quickly,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
and became rather popular.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
We started making prints from them.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
This is Manhattan, one from the series.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
This is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
We began doing these big silkscreen prints,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
and they started selling, too.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So, the gallery wanted me to have another show

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
in two years,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
which meant that I really

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
had to paint these paintings

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
much faster

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
than I had ever done them. And I --

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
they started to become more political, and I picked areas

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
that sort of were in the news

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
or that I had some feeling about,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
and I began doing these things.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And then this funny thing happened.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I found that I was no longer at play.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I was actually in this solemn landscape

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
of fulfilling an expectation

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
for a show,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
which is not where I started with these things.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
So, while they became successful,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I know how to make them,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
so I'm not a neophyte,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
and they're no longer serious --

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
they have become solemn.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And that's a terrifying factor --

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
when you start something and it turns that way --

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
because it means that all that's left for you

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
is to go back and to find out

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
what the next thing is that you can push,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
that you can be arrogant about,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
that you can fail with,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and that you can be a fool with.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Because in the end, that's how you grow,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and that's all that matters.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
So, I'm plugging along here --

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
(Laughter)

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Thank you very much.
