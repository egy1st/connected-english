00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's happening in genomics,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and how this revolution is about to change everything we know

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
running around and eating and doing each other

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And that moved us to the next level.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And we've seen many seminal moments.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and who would have thought back then that every single person

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
would not have just one computer but probably 20,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in your washing machine, your cell phone.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then we go along and create the Internet

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and connect the world together; we flatten the world.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
these high-powered tools --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that are allowing us to turn the lens inward

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
People never want to say, I really don't understand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A genome is really a description for 
all of the DNA that is in a living organism.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And when Watson and Crick in the '50s

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
very long, complicated molecule --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we then started on this journey to understand that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
There is a historical archive.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Living in your genome is the history of our species,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that's now starting to be understood.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It is the program. It is the code of life.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It is what makes you function;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it is what makes every organism function.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
DNA is a very elegant molecule.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's long and it's complicated.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And with these four letters, you can create a language:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
creating a word or what we call base pairs.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And you would, you know, when you think about it,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And that may not sound very intuitive,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
The language of technology is binary;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you've probably heard that at some point in time.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Everything that happens in digital is converted,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or a representation, of a one and a zero.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and it's going over the network,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So, let's talk about what that means.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, if you look at a human genome,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And they mix up in all different fashions,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and that makes you a human being.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's not really all that much data.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This here is a bug in my genome

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that I have struggled with for a long, long time.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We are starting to understand that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So, up to this point we tried to fix it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and maybe it's going to make it work.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
What is the code?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We have about a hundred, 120,000 others

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that don't appear to function every day,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
going back tens of thousands of years.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You might also be interested in knowing

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
or the evolutionary order of any particular species.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that makes the difference between any one of us.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That's a tiny amount of material,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but the way that ultimately expresses itself

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So, we are now able to read genomes.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And if you think about the computer industry

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you will see that happen in the next five years.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And what that means is, you are going to walk around

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And when you buy medicine,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and your drug will be made for you

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and it will work much better than the ones that were --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you won't have side effects.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
They're going to make all that stuff go away.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
What does a genome look like?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but what scientists are doing now is

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
they're understanding what these do and what they mean.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In other words, the first couple of sentences here,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
assuming this is a grape plant:

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
In a human being, down in here it could be:

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
make blood cells, start cancer.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
because I come from a very cold climate.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's all hidden in this code,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
now that we're starting to have the book of life?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting. 


00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You can find out where your relatives come from;

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We can understand functionality. This is really important.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Because we can understand this,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we can fix them, make better organisms.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Most importantly, what we're learning

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
The toolbox exists.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and we now have the ability to use it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
you've come in contact with this little bug.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
does it just boot up and live?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Well, guess what. It does.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So, you know, by being able to write a genome

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and plug it into an organism,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And this is extremely profound.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So, last year the French and Italians announced

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
although it's very important to understand

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that those compounds that it's cranking out

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
for us to understand and interpret those flavors.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They've also discovered that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
They now are understanding, and the work is going on,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So, then what do you do?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
(Laughter)

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We can build a better vine.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
By the way, just so you know:

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that is not genetically modified.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
they would not exist in nature on their own.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
we can go for higher yields without necessarily having

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We could conceivably expand the climate window:

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
(Laughter)

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
We could produce better flavors and aromas. 


00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
All of these things could conceivably be done,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But there's an ecosystem here.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
we are part of a big ecosystem.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We find microbial life in every part of the planet:

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it is the ecosystem around them,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that have just as much impact on the character of those plants

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
If you take a closer look at a root system,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
This is not big news to viticulturists;

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You don't necessarily know with granularity

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We can start to figure that out.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir; 


00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it --

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
There are thousands of microbes there.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
we can figure out what they are.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And then we understand what is terroir.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
he's not always the most politically correct guy ...

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
(Laughter)

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
"Well, somebody has to."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
(Laughter)

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I consider myself a very spiritual person,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and without, you know, the organized religion part,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
They're here. They're in the universe.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We reorganize things, we change them around,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
but we don't make anything unnatural.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Now, we can create bad impacts --

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
These are chemical factories;

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and we now can use those.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
There also is a set of rules.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Nature will not allow you to --

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Nature has put a set of rules out there.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
we're just learning what the rules are.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
if you could make disease go away,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
because we understand how it actually works,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
if we could create clean and plentiful energy --

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
If we could, would we?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
is the next step in humankind's evolution.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Thank you.
