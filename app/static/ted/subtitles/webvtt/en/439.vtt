WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and since then we and our growing global team of contributors

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
all providing a path to a future

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional. 


00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There are tons of places to go, online and off,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
if what you want to find is the latest bit of news

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We focus primarily on the planet's environment,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but we also address issues of global development,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and much, much more.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but to give you a sense of what we cover:

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
tools for rapid disaster relief,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
such as this inflatable concrete shelter;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
innovative uses of bioscience,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
distributed power generation using solar power, wind power,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
ocean power, other clean energy sources;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and better urban design, 


00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so you don't need to drive as much in the first place; 


00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
distributed computing projects

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that will help us model the future of the climate.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the consequences of extreme longevity,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
has convinced me, much to my own surprise,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that successful responses to the world's problems

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
are nonetheless possible.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
can really blind you to the very possibility of success.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In difficult times, pessimism is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The truth is, we can build a better world,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and we can do so right now.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and we're coming up with new ones all the time.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We have the knowledge,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and our understanding of the planet improves every day.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Most importantly, we have the motive:

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and write up every day have some important aspects in common:

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a few concrete examples of how these principles combine

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
in world-changing ways.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to make the invisible visible -- that is,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to make apparent the conditions of the world around us

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We know that people often change their behavior

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
As a small example, many of us have experienced

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
the change in driving behavior that comes from having

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a real time display of mileage showing precisely

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in how we measure and display aspects of the world

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that display how much power your household is using,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
these can actually have a direct positive impact

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on your energy footprint.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
or a natural disaster is unfolding,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
allow us to better understand the context and the flow

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of processes that affect us all.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We can see world-changing values in research projects

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that seek to meet the world's medical needs

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
through open access to data and collaborative action.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
are far more important.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
make cutting-edge scientific research free to all --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
everyone in the world.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And actually, a growing number of science publishers

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
are adopting this model.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
around the world worked together

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
for some of the developing world's worst diseases:

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
That genome data can now be found

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
on open-access genetic data banks around the world,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and it's an enormous boon to researchers

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
trying to come up with treatments.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But my favorite example has to be the global response

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The U.S. National Research Council

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And we can see world-changing values

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
in something as humble as a cell phone.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
who do not use a mobile phone --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
For many of us, cell phones have really become

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
almost an extension of ourselves,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and we're really now beginning to see the social changes

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that mobile phones can bring about.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You may already know some of the big-picture aspects:

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
globally, more camera phones were sold last year

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
than any other kind of camera,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
A study last year showed a direct correlation

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
between the growth of mobile phone use

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
have actually become an alternative currency.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
to the Blairwatch Project in the UK,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Laughter)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And it's just going to get more wild.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
may be among the world's most important technologies.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And in this rapidly evolving context,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
something far more than a medium for social interaction.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I've long admired the Witness project,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in his profoundly moving presentation.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to send in their recordings over the Internet,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for documenting abuses,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of what's happening to the planet:

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
from activists and researchers

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to businesspeople and political figures.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It would highlight the changes that are underway,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but would more importantly give voice

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to the people who are willing to work

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to see a new world, a better world, come about.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It would give everyday citizens

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
for what this imaginary project could aspire to,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
especially environmental crimes

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
That's understandable and important.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.


00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In the best Worldchanging tradition,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Earth Witness would show us two worlds:

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the world we're leaving behind,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and the world we're building for generations to come.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
we could do it today.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The key components are already widely available.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to always-on, widely available information tools.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You could even imagine a version of this scenario

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in which people actually build their own phones.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
have come up with multiple models

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
for usable, Linux-based mobile phones,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
At the other end of the network, there'd be

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
a server for people to send photos and messages to,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
but for those of you for whom that last sentence

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the online part of the Earth Witness project

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
would be created by the users, working together and working openly.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but students and engineers around the world

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
using bird-mounted sensors

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
on a phone carried by a person.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
uploading the data, displaying the results.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
designing a prototype phone

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the presence of some biotoxins --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You could see that some kind of system like this

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
would actually be a really good fit

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And that's worth noting in particular.


00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
has been simply phenomenal.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Developers around the world have come up with

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
from bus routes and crime statistics

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to the global progress of avian flu.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
if something like this ever existed.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of what's happening on our planet environmentally

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
than could be gathered with satellites

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and a handful of government sensor nets alone.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to environmental awareness and protection,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And most important,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
This is a system that could put the next generation

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
at the front lines of gathering environmental data.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the worst effects of climate disruption,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
every little bit of information matters.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us 


00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the improvement of the planet itself.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Now, as I suggested at the outset,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
so why have I spent the bulk of my time

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
telling you about something that doesn't exist?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Because this is what tomorrow could look like:

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
making use of technological innovations and human communities alike,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
we might just be able to fix it ourselves.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
powerful tools, and innovative ideas

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
There's a staggering array of wonders out there,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
success can be ours if we're willing to try.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And as we say at Worldchanging,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
another world isn't just possible; another world is here.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
