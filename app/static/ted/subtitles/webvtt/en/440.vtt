WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, I want to start out with

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
this beautiful picture from my childhood.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I love the science fiction movies.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here it is: "This Island Earth."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Two-and-a-half years in the making.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Laughter)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but Hollywood goes to the chase.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
flying saucers and aliens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where we got tired of turning on the TV

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and tried to write a counter-argument to it,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which requires a huge amount of evolution,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and therefore constancy of conditions.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you go back two billion years,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Well, "Rare Earth" actually

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and with all great earnestness walked in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
David Brin was going to debate me on this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You cannot take people's aliens away from them

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and expect to be anybody's friends.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, the second part of that, soon after --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It was, "It burns! It burns!"

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I really do think we have to start thinking

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
about what's a good planet and what isn't.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because this was a slide that was passed

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and it can't even get the letters right --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I mean, there we are.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and to live on its surface if we're protected.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because of rampant carbon dioxide.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
what's going to happen to our particular planet.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
following the first horrible microbial age.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
complexity arose,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
as they have been here now,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
till we hit the second microbial age.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that will happen, paradoxically --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
everything you hear about global warming --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we are no longer going to have to have plants

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and this is what's left.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and we are in its golden summer age right now.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And that's the fate of a planet, too.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
or gets blasted by some supernova nearby

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But what about accidental death?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
have been charting death. It's strange --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and he said, Aha! It's extinct.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
since complex life really began to leave

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
a very interesting fossil record.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
In that complex record of fossils,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
there were times when lots of stuff

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
seemed to be dying out very quickly,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and the father/mother geologists

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
called these "mass extinctions."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
All along it was thought to be either an act of God

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
or perhaps long, slow climate change, 


00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and that really changed in 1980,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
what was the time difference between these white rocks,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And what they found was something unexpected.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
is filled with iridium.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and it's filled with quartz grains

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Now, in this slide the white is chalk,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The chalk itself's composed by plankton

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and then you have black rock.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in the absence of plankton.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the death of these beautiful ammonites,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and so much else.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I mean, it must be true,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
there are present-day processes that will explain it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Well, there are five major mass extinctions 


00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
They range from 450 million years ago

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to the last, the K-T, number four,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
on large-body impact.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
But is this true?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
because of this beautiful structure on the right.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of my late beloved '60s,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
they're called "buckyballs."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This evidence was used to suggest

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and it captures bits of the comet.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But is this true?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in the great Karoo desert.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
into the new South Africa as I went year by year.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I worked on this Permian extinction,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And the fossils are extraordinary.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
These are mammal-like reptiles.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
probably had a head like a lion.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But there's lots of stuff.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This is my poor son, Patrick.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This is called paleontological child abuse.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Hold still, you're the scale.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Laughter)

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
There was big stuff back then.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The age of mammals had well and truly started

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
250 million years ago ...

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
... and then a catastrophe happened.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Now, luckily,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But we've got survivors and things that get through,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
The survivors that do get through 


00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And there they would hide for 160 million years,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
until liberated by that K-T asteroid.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So, if not impact, what?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and the microbes are still out there.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
They hate we animals.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
They really want their world back.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And they've tried over and over and over again.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
believing in the Gaia theory? No.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, I really suspect there's an alternative,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and that life does actually try to do itself in --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
not consciously, but just because it does.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
There are microbes which, through their metabolism,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
produce hydrogen sulfide,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and they do so in large amounts.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
but we can also detect their presence in the past.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And the last three years have seen

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I am almost extinct --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
collect biomarkers.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it, 


00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and from that they can produce compounds

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and be extracted and tell us who was there.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
at many of these mass extinction boundaries,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
enough, for instance, to come out of solution.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Well, what's the source of this?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
actually, the effects are even worse.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
spreads out over the surface of the planet.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and what we try to do now is

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record -- 


00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and we can do this from a variety of means --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and put all the red lines here,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And there's two things that are really evident here to me,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But the second thing that's not shown on here:

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the Earth has never had any ice on it

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We are at 380 and climbing.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So, there goes the ice caps,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I live in a view house now;

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I'm going to have waterfront.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to take place on planet Earth.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
They stop complex life from existing.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
this is off the Great Barrier Reef.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And as we speak now, 


00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But the thing about this is that every once in a while

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
we divers can run into trouble,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Well now, I die.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and our bodies have adapted.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
He bleeds out pigs.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and he turns a mammal into a reptile.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I got this email from him two years ago;

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So, he now has taken mice down

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
the dotted line, the temperatures.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and down it goes, down it goes.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
in this solid graph,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and look what happens to its temperature.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Its temperature drops.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and comes out of this perfectly fine.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You're in an accident. You've got two choices:

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
What are you going to do?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
This is coming towards us,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and I think this is going to be a revolution.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and, yes, we have to think about the long term,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
because we will get hit again.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Give us a few millennia --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and we humans should last those few millennia --

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
How many of us flew here?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
How many of us have gone through

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
our entire Kyoto quota

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
just for flying this year?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We have to beat this.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
(Applause)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
is that we have in our own bodies

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
due to climate change?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
This is what Roth has found out.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
how many of these have happened in the past.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
CA: It's simultaneously

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
PW: Blessing and curse.
