00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I became an inventor by accident. 


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: 


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, 


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
was working at the University of Washington, 


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, 


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. 


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
any of the cool stuff we've got now. 


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it was an arm that, 



00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, 


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm. 


00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,


00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I got really lucky after that. 


00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And without giving you too much of a tirade, 


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today: 


00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
my 44th invention. No, that's not true either. 


00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention. 


00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I call this hypersonic sound. 


00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes, 


00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but I want to make an analogy before I do


00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to this.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say, 


00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's really cool, but what's it good for? 


00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I say, What is the light bulb good for? 


00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy. 


00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Hasn't changed that much. 


00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Light came out of it in every direction. 


00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Before the light bulb was invented, 


00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, 


00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
focus it a little bit; 


00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
put lenses in front of it,


00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
focus it a little bit better.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers 


00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that were totally focused. 


00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, think about where the world would be today 


00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
if we had the light bulb,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but you couldn't focus light;

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You turn on the loudspeaker,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the sound just kind of goes where it wants.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it's pretty much every direction.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
A little bit of differential, but not much.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or computers, or T.V. sets,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of what the importance is 


00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
of being able to focus light.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I thought it was about time that we figure out

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a way to put sound where you want to.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I have a couple of units.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
small version, over your head --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Applause)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Applause)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They tried this back in the '60s

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and were too smart, and so they gave up.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But they want to use it -- seriously.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There's a mix an inventor has to have.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You have to be kind of smart,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Too many other smart people out there. So.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I just happened to get my education in a little different way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm not at all against education.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
when they get educated, lose it:

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And we're living in a great time right now,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because almost everything's being explored anew.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
virtually nothing --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I mean this honestly --

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
has been invented yet.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We're just starting.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
They know that when you watch T.V. at home,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
because there are so many choices

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you can change channels, miss their commercials.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you get to watch it for free;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
when you want to hear the sound, you pay.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
where when you step in the line in the supermarket --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
you'll be watching TV.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And hopefully they'll be sensitive

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
if you don't want to hear it,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I have been really lucky with this technology:

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They have literally beat a path to our door.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We've been selling it since about last September, October,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and it's been immensely gratifying.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but this unit, with the electronics and everything,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We expect by this time next year,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And the sound that you're hearing,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
is made out in front of it, in the air.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You turn up the volume just a little bit --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I'm having an effect on the pressure,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
which means during the making of that sine wave,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
All of audio as we know it

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Linearity means higher quality sound.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
but it's so predictable

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Instead of being made on the face of the cone,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
it's made at literally billions of little independent points

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
along this narrow column in the air,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and so when I aim it towards you,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
what you hear is made right next to your ears.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I said we can shorten the column,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we can spread it out to cover the couch.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
When you listen to stereo on your home system,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
your both ears hear both speakers.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Turn on the left speaker sometime

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, the stage is more restricted --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Because the sound is made in the air along this column,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
it does not follow the inverse square law,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which says it drops off about two thirds

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
every time you double the distance:

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and the guy in the front row gets the same level

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Isn't that terrific?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in having companies catch the vision of this,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and a separate system in the back --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
(Laughter)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I was seeing if you were listening.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
or their rap music or whatever.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is really starting to catch on.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It also works five times better underwater.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
where you can put fake troop movements

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
quarter of a mile away on a hillside.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
(Laughter)

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
(Laughter)

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that can look at their countenance,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
from 100 yards away when they play this thing.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Pain is 120.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and there can be a public beach just off to the side,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and they don't even know it's turned on.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
you're over there, and it's there.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I have a bunch of other inventions.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We're using very short wavelengths.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
When you run very short wavelengths,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and there's more energy coming out of the antenna

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
than there is the backscatter from the ground

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Turn it on; turn it off.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
That's a fluorescent tube refined."

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
(Laughter)

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
in my attic at my house,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and one of the many designs which they have now

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
is still the same design I drew way back when.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Let me give you, in the last minute,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
one more quick demo of this guy,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
for those of you that haven't heard it.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Can never tell if it's on.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Getting it over there?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Get the cameraman.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Yeah, there you go.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Thank you once again.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Appreciate it very much.
