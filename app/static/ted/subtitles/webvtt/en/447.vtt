00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
quickly start out with

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a little bit of music here. (Applause)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Music)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Applause)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Thank you! (Applause)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I took my shoes off to dance,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but maybe I'll get at that later.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Anyways, I... where to start?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Well, I'm really excited

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to talk a bit about

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
my own upbringing in music

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and family and all of that,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
but I'm even more excited for you people

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to hear about Donnell's amazing family

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and maybe even a little bit about

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
how we met,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and all that sort of thing,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but for those of you that may not

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
be familiar with my upbringing,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm from Cape Breton Island,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
which is a very, very musical island,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and its origins come from Scotland

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
with the music and all the traditions,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the dancing, the language,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which unfortunately is dying out

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in Cape Breton.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The traditional language is Gaelic,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but a lot of the music came

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from the Gaelic language,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and the dancing and the singing

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and everything, and my bloodline

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is Scottish through and through,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but my mother and father

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
are two very, very musical people.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
My mom taught me to dance

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
when I was five, and my dad

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
My uncle is a very well-known

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Cape Breton fiddler.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
His name's Buddy MacMaster,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and just a wonderful guy,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and we have a great tradition at home

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
called square dancing,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and we had parties, great parties

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
at our house and the neighbors' houses,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
but kitchen party

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in Cape Breton is very common,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and basically somebody drops into the house,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and no matter what house you go to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
guaranteed, and I'd say,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
well there's first of all more fiddlers

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in the world, so ten chances to one,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the fellow who walked in the door

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
could play it, so you'd have someone come

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
into the house, you'd invite them to play

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
a tune, and lo and behold

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
a little party would start up and somebody would dance,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so it was a wonderful, wonderful way

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to grow up, and that is where

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
my beginnings in music come from:

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
my surroundings, my family,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I've done lots of things with my music.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I've recorded lots of CDs.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I was nominated for a Grammy and

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I've won some awards and stuff like that,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
so that's awesome,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but the best part was meeting my husband,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and I've actually known Donnell

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
for probably 12 years now, and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
how music brought us together,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but I'm going to introduce you

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
right now to my new husband

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
as of October 5,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Donnell Leahy. (Applause)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Applause)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
experience and I'm glad to be here,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
but I'm just trying to put it all together,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
trying to figure all you people out, and I've

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
been here for a short while, and I'm starting

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
to understand a little bit better.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So I asked Natalie, what do I do?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And she said, just talk about yourself.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and we grew up on a farm.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and I'm the oldest boy.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There are four girls a little bit older than me.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We grew up without a television.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
People find that strange,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
but I think it was a great blessing for us.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We had a television for a few years,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
but of course we wasted so much time

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and the work wasn't getting done,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
so out went the television.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We grew up playing—

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Mom and Natalie's mother

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
knew each other. We grew up playing,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and used to dance together, right, yeah.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we played by ear and I think

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that's important for us because

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
we were not really exposed to a lot of

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
different styles of music.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We learned to play the instruments,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but we kind of had to come from within

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
or go from within, because we didn't

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
radio. We went to church

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and to school sometimes,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and farmed and played music,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
so we were able, I think,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
at a very critical age to develop

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
our own style, our own self,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and my mother plays, my father plays,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and the style that came

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
we call it French-Canadian style

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
but it originated in logging camps.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Years ago, hundreds of men would go

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
up for the winter to the camps

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in Northern Ontario and in Quebec,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and they were all different cultures,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and the Irish, the French, Scottish,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
German, they'd all meet, and of course

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
at night, they'd play cards

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and step dance and play fiddles,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and over the course of many years,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and the Ottawa Valley step dancing

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
evolved, so that's, I kind of started out

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
with that style and I quickly

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
started doing my own thing,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and then I met Natalie, and I was

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That's how we met. (Laughter)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You tell them. (Laughter)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
NM: You want to or no? (Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well I guess I have to now.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Well, it's just so interesting that

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Donnell's upbringing was very similar

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
when I was about 12 years old,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and he and his family came to

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Inverness, which is about 45 minutes

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
from where I lived, and I was just

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
blown away, like, it was just amazing,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and you'll find out why pretty soon here,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
but I couldn't believe the fiddling

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and Mom was there with me,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and she was saying —

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Donnell's mother came up on stage

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and danced with her children, and Mom

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I used to dance with her when we

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
were kids. Little did I think our children

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
would be playing instruments, you know,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
playing music, yeah."

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
her kids would be getting married,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
but anyway, so, then I got

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
a phone call about, I dunno,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
seven years later. I was 19,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
first or second year of college,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it was Donnell, and

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
he said "Hi, you probably don't know me

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but my name is Donnell Leahy."

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And I said, "I know you.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I have a tape of yours at home."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,"

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
which is where I was,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and he asked me out for supper.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
That's it. (Laughter)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
(Applause)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Then we dated for two years,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
broke up for 10, got back together

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and got married. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
so I'll just get to it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I starts out with a slow air.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Airs were played in Europe

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
at burials, as a body was carried out

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
from the wake site to the burial site,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the procession was led by a piper

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
or a fiddle player.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I'll quickly play a short part of the air,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and then I'm going to get into

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to play when you're not warmed up,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
anyway. It's called The Banks.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:09.000
(Tuning)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Laughter)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Music)

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:44.000
(Applause)

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
NM: Well, we're gonna play one

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
together now. (Applause)

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We're laughing, like, because

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
our styles are totally different,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
as you can hear.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And so, you know, Donnell and I

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
are actually in the process of

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
writing new pieces of music together

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that we can play,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
but we don't have any of those ready.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
We just started yesterday. (Laughter)

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So we're gonna play something together anyway.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
DL: With one minute.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
NM: With one minute.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
(Audience reaction)

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
because you've got to do your thing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
(Music)

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
(Tuning)

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
the bird pose right now. (Laughter)

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:09.000
(Music)

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000
(Audience claps along)

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
(Applause)

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Announcer: Great news,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
they're running late downstairs.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
We've got another 10 minutes.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
(Applause)

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
NM: Okay. Sure.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
All right, okay.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Let's get her going. (Applause)

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
(Tuning)

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
DL: What do you want to play?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
NM: Well, um...

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000
(Music) (Laughter)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
NM: Uh, sure.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
DL: How fast?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
NM: Not too fast.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:46.000
(Music)

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
(Audience claps along)

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
(Cheering)

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
(Audience claps along)

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
(Music)

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:35.000
(Applause)

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
DL: We're going to play a tune

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
The Cape Breton piano playing

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
is just awesome. It's very rhythmic

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
and, you'll see it.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
My mom plays piano, and she learned

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
to play before they had a piano at home

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
the rhythms on a piece of board,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
and the fiddlers would all congregate

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
to play on the cold winter's evenings

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
and Mom would be banging on this board,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
so when they bought a piano,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
they bought it in Toronto and had it taken

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
by train and brought in on a horse,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
a horse and sleigh to the house.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
It became the only piano in the region,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
and Mom said she could basically play

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
as soon as the piano arrived,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
she could play it because she had learned

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
all these rhythms. Anyway, we found

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
the piano last year and were able to

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
bring it back home. We purchased it.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
It had gone through, like,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
five or six families,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
and it was just a big thing for us,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
and we found actually an old picture

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
of somebody and their family years ago.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
NM: Just tell them what—

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
DL: She wants me to talk about—

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
We have a band named Leahy.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
There's 11 siblings. We, um—

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
What will I tell them? (Laughter)

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
We opened—

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
NM: No surgeries.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
We had a great opportunity.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
It was a big thing for us, and now

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
all my sisters are off having babies

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and the boys are all getting married, so we're

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
staying close to home for, I guess,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
another couple of weeks.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
What can I say? I don't know what to say,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
(Laughter)

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
NM: Is this what marriage is about?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
(Applause)

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I like it. (Applause)

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
(Laughter)

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
DL: Oh yeah, okay,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
in my family we had seven girls, four boys,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
we had two fiddles and one piano,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and of course we were all fighting to play

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
on the instruments, so dad and mom

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
off the instrument. You had to wait

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
until they were finished, so of course,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
what we would do is we'd get on the piano

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
and you wouldn't even get off to eat,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
because you wouldn't want to give it up

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
to your brother or sister, and they'd wait

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and you'd be still sitting there on the piano,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
but it was their way to get us to practice.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Will we play a tune?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
NM: It worked. DL: It worked.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Sorry, I hate to carry on...

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Okay, play in, how about A?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
(Music)

00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:03.000
(Applause)
