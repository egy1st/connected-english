(Music)

00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:14.662
(Music ends)

00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:21.675
(Applause)

00:08:32.463 --> 00:08:33.464
(Applause ends)

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:35.548
Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:37.731
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.

00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:41.332
(Audience cheers)

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:45.482
(Applause)

00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:50.076
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.284
(Laughter)

00:08:52.308 --> 00:08:57.610
I mean, what does this have to do
with technology, entertainment and design?

00:08:58.784 --> 00:09:03.135
Well, I count my iPod,
cellphone and computer as technology,

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.088
but this has nothing to do with that.

00:09:06.683 --> 00:09:09.008
So I did a little research on it.

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:11.318
Well, this is what I found.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.377
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:14.405
(Clears throat)

00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:17.892
The violin is made of a wood box
and four metal strings.

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:20.751
By pulling a string, it vibrates
and produces a sound wave,

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:23.323
which passes through
a piece of wood called a bridge,

00:09:23.347 --> 00:09:26.838
and goes down to the wood box
and gets amplified, but ... let me think.

00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:30.172
(Laughter)

00:09:30.586 --> 00:09:33.475
Placing your finger
at different places on the fingerboard

00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:37.088
changes the string length, and that
changes the frequency of the sound wave.

00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:38.487
(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.866
(Laughter)

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.497
OK, this is sort of technology,

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.016
but I can call it
a 16th-century technology.

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:52.413
But actually, the most
fascinating thing that I found

00:09:52.437 --> 00:09:56.672
was that even the audio system
or wave transmission nowadays

00:09:56.696 --> 00:10:01.976
are still based on the same principle
of producing and projecting sound.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.161
Isn't that cool?

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:06.976
(Laughter)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.327
(Applause)

00:10:13.883 --> 00:10:16.834
Design -- I love its design.

00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:19.650
I remember when I was little,
my mom asked me,

00:10:19.674 --> 00:10:21.976
"Would you like to play
the violin or the piano?"

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.232
I looked at that giant monster
and said to myself --

00:10:26.256 --> 00:10:31.409
"I am not going to lock myself
on that bench the whole day!"

00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:32.543
(Laughter)

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:34.373
This is small and lightweight.

00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.856
I can play from standing,
sitting or walking.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.292
And, you know what?

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:42.976
The best of all is that
if I don't want to practice,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.816
(Whispering) I can hide it.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.165
(Laughter)

00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:50.817
The violin is very beautiful.

00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:53.530
Some people relate it
as the shape of a lady.

00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:58.820
But whether you like it or not,
it's been so for more than 400 years,

00:10:58.844 --> 00:11:02.573
unlike modern stuff
[that] easily looks dated.

00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:05.097
But I think it's very personal
and unique that,

00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:07.659
although each violin looks pretty similar,

00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:10.105
no two violins sound the same --

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.545
even from the same maker
or based on the same model.

00:11:14.418 --> 00:11:18.033
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.

00:11:18.057 --> 00:11:22.944
But actually, the instrument itself
isn't very entertaining.

00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:27.312
I mean, when I first got my violin
and tried to play around on it,

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:30.664
it was actually really bad,

00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:34.675
because it didn't sound the way
I'd heard from other kids --

00:11:34.699 --> 00:11:37.165
it was so horrible and so scratchy.

00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:39.538
So, it wasn't entertaining at all.

00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:46.239
But besides, my brother
found this very funny:

00:11:46.263 --> 00:11:48.630
Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!

00:11:48.654 --> 00:11:54.976
(Laughter)

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.794
A few years later, I heard a joke

00:11:56.818 --> 00:11:59.143
about the greatest violinist,
Jascha Heifetz.

00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:00.814
After Mr. Heifetz's concert,

00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:02.847
a lady came over and complimented him:

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.005
"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin
sounded so great tonight!"

00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:08.976
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.869
so he picked up his violin and said,

00:12:10.893 --> 00:12:12.588
"Funny -- I don't hear anything."

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:15.301
(Laughter)

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:18.292
Now I realize that as the musician,

00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:23.699
we human beings, with our great mind,
artistic heart and skill,

00:12:23.723 --> 00:12:28.580
can change this 16th-century technology
and a legendary design

00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:30.516
to a wonderful entertainment.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.605
Now I know why I'm here.

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:40.316
(Music)

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:08.946
(Music ends)

00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:17.871
(Applause)

00:16:19.315 --> 00:16:22.420
At first, I thought I was just
going to be here to perform,

00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:26.507
but unexpectedly, I learned
and enjoyed much more.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.723
But ... although some of the talks
were quite up there for me.

00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:36.983
(Laughter)

00:16:37.007 --> 00:16:40.498
Like the multi-dimension stuff.

00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:43.844
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough

00:16:43.868 --> 00:16:46.976
if I could actually get
my two dimensions correct in school.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.092
(Laughter)

00:16:50.306 --> 00:16:54.786
But actually, the most
impressive thing to me is that --

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.586
well, actually, I would also like
to say this for all children

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:04.516
is to say thank you to all adults,
for actually caring for us a lot,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.746
and to make our future world much better.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.921
Thank you.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:15.866
(Applause)

00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:22.667
(Music)

00:22:05.376 --> 00:22:07.725
(Music ends)

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:14.886
(Applause)

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:34.885
(Applause ends)

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:39.888
(Music)

00:24:15.938 --> 00:24:17.938
(Music ends)

00:24:19.031 --> 00:24:24.000
(Applause)
