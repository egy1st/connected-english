00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.695
Right when I was 15 was when
I first got interested in solar energy.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.576
My family had moved from Fort Lee,
New Jersey to California,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.936
from the snow to lots of heat,
and gas lines.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.336
There was gas rationing in 1973.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.416
The energy crisis was in full bore.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.576
I started reading
"Popular Science" magazine,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.456
and I got really excited
about the potential of solar energy

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.216
to try and solve that crisis.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.376
I had just taken
trigonometry in high school,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.776
I learned about the parabola

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.696
and how it could concentrate
rays of light to a single focus.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.296
That got me very excited.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.536
And I really felt
that there would be potential

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.256
to build some kind of thing
that could concentrate light.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.976
So, I started this company
called Solar Devices.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.256
And this was a company
where I built parabolas,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.536
I took metal shop,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.296
and I remember walking into metal shop
building parabolas and Stirling engines.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.936
And I was building a Stirling engine
over on the lathe,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.296
and all the motorcycle guys said,
"You're building a bong, aren't you?"

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.576
And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine."
But they didn't believe me.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.656
I sold the plans for this engine

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.536
and for this dish in the back
of "Popular Science" magazine,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.976
for four dollars each.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.936
And I earned enough money
to pay for my first year of Caltech.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.696
It was a really big excitement for me
to get into Caltech.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.776
And at my first year at Caltech,
I continued the business.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.736
But then, in the second year of Caltech,
they started grading.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.936
The whole first year was pass/fail,
but the second year was graded.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.016
I wasn't able to keep up
with the business,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.856
and I ended up with a 25-year detour.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.056
My dream had been to convert solar energy
at a very practical cost,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.616
but then I had this big detour.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.256
First, the coursework at Caltech.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.016
Then, when I graduated from Caltech,
the IBM PC came out,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.096
and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.456
And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.696
and I was completely blown away
by Lotus 1-2-3.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.896
I began operating my business with 1-2-3,
began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.256
wrote a natural language
interface to 1-2-3.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.256
I started an educational software company
after I joined Lotus,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.616
and then I started Idealab
so I could have a roof

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.776
under which I could build
multiple companies in succession.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.180
Much later -- in 2000, very recently --
the new California energy crisis --

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.035
what was purported to be
a big energy crisis -- was coming.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.516
And I was trying to figure out

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.237
if we could build something
that would capitalize on that

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.146
and get people backup energy,
in case the crisis really came.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.281
And I started looking at how
we could build battery backup systems

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.476
that could give people five hours,
10 hours, maybe even a full day,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.416
or three days' worth of backup power.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.456
I'm glad you heard earlier today,
batteries are unbelievably --

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.456
lack density compared to fuel.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.496
So much more energy can be stored
with fuel than with batteries.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.576
You'd have to fill your entire
parking space of one garage space

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.016
just to give yourself
four hours of battery backup.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.736
And I concluded, after researching
every other technology

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.776
that we could deploy for storing energy --

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.136
flywheels, different
formulations of batteries --

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.536
it just wasn't practical to store energy.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.216
So what about making energy?
Maybe we could make energy.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.936
I tried to figure out --
maybe solar's become attractive.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.016
It's been 25 years since I was doing this,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.176
let me go back and look
at what's been happening with solar cells.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.576
And the price had gone down
from 10 dollars a watt

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.256
to about four or five dollars a watt,
but it stabilized.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.776
And it needed to get much lower
to be cost-effective.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.705
I studied all the new things
that had happened in solar cells,

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.096
and was looking for ways we could
make solar cells more inexpensively.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.496
A lot of new things
are happening to do that,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.856
but fundamentally, the process
requires a tremendous amount of energy.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.576
Some people say it takes
more energy to make a solar cell

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.576
than it will give out in its entire life.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.496
If we reduce the amount of energy
it takes to make the cells,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.096
that will become more practical.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.576
But right now, you pretty much
have to take silicon,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.176
put it in an oven at 1600 F
for 17 hours, to make the cells.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.616
A lot of people are working
to try and reduce that,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.616
but I didn't have anything to contribute.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.096
So I tried to figure out
what other way could we try

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.296
to make cost-effective solar electricity.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.776
What if we collect the sun
with a large reflector --

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.976
like I had been thinking about
in high school,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.816
but maybe with modern technology
we could make it cheaper --

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.896
concentrate it to a small converter,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.976
and then the conversion device
wouldn't have to be as expensive,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.456
because it's much smaller,
rather than solar cells,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.896
which have to cover the entire surface
that you want to gather sun from.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.176
This seemed practical now,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.936
because a lot of new technologies
had come in the 25 years

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.416
since I had last looked at it.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.696
There was a lot
of new manufacturing techniques,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.936
not to mention really cheap
miniature motors --

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.136
brushless motors,
servomotors, stepper motors,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.056
that are used in printers and scanners.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.336
So, that's a breakthrough.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.216
Of course, inexpensive microprocessors

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.136
and a very important breakthrough --
genetic algorithms.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.136
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.736
It's a powerful way of solving intractable
problems using natural selection.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.176
You take a problem that you can't solve
with a pure mathematical answer,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.375
you build an evolutionary system
to try multiple tries at guessing,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.616
you add sex --

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.256
where you take half of one solution
and half of another

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.736
and then make new mutations --

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.816
and you use natural selection
to kill off not-as-good solutions.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.416
Usually, with a genetic algorithm
on a computer today,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.176
with a three gigahertz processor,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.929
you can solve many
formerly intractable problems

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:38.456
in just a matter of minutes.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.536
So we tried to come up with a way
to use genetic algorithms

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.376
to create a new type of concentrator.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.296
And I'll show you what we came up with.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.416
Traditionally,
concentrators look like this.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.776
Those shapes are parabolas.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.176
They take all the parallel incoming rays
and focus it to a single spot.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.496
They have to track the sun,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.736
because they have to point
directly at the sun.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.136
They usually have
a one degree acceptance angle --

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.896
once they're more than a degree off,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.056
none of the sunlight rays
will hit the focus.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.536
So we tried to come up
with a non-tracking collector

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.096
that would gather much more than
one degree of light, with no moving parts.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.496
So we created a genetic algorithm
to try this out,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.096
we made a model in Excel
of a multisurface reflector,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.176
and an amazing thing evolved, literally,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.016
from trying a billion cycles,
a billion different attempts,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.456
with a fitness function that defined
how can you collect the most light,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.696
from the most angles,
over a day, from the sun.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.416
And this is the shape that evolved.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.096
It's this non-tracking collector
with these six tuba-like horns,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.656
and each of them collect light
in the following way --

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.376
if the sunlight strikes right here,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.256
it might bounce right to the center,
the hot spot, directly,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.696
but if the sun is off axis
and comes from the side,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.136
it might hit two places
and take two bounces.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.976
So for direct light,
it takes only one bounce,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.896
for off-axis light it might take two,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.416
and for extreme off-axis,
it might take three.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.536
Your efficiency goes down
with more bounces,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.976
because you lose about 10 percent
with each bounce,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.856
but this allowed us to collect light
from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.056
So, about two and a half hours of the day

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.416
we could collect
with a stationary component.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.216
Solar cells collect light
for four and a half hours though.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.496
On an average adjusted day,
a solar cell --

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.456
because the sun's moving across the sky,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.736
the solar cell is going down
with a sine wave function of performance

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.016
at the off-axis angles.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.176
It collects about four and a half
average hours of sunlight a day.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.976
So even this, although it was great
with no moving parts --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.456
we could achieve high
temperatures -- wasn't enough.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.936
We needed to beat solar cells.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.616
So we took a look at another idea.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.498
We looked at a way to break up a parabola
into individual petals that would track.

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.896
So what you see here is 12 separate petals

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.816
that each could be controlled
with individual microprocessors

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.296
that would only cost a dollar.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.336
You can buy a two-megahertz
microprocessor for a dollar now.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.536
And you can buy stepper motors
that pretty much never wear out

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.176
because they have no brushes,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.416
for a dollar.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.096
So we can control all 12 of these petals
for under 50 dollars

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.616
and what this would allow us to do
is not have to move the focus any more,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.896
but only move the petals.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.256
The whole system would have
a much lower profile,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.776
but also we could gather sunlight
for six and a half to seven hours a day.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.696
Now that we have concentrated sunlight,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.216
what are we going to put at the center
to convert sunlight to electricity?

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.736
So we tried to look
at all the different heat engines

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.576
that have been used in history to convert
sunlight or heat to electricity,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.456
And one of the great ones of all time,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.656
James Watt's steam engine of 1788
was a major breakthrough.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.016
James Watt didn't actually invent
the steam engine, he just refined it.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.776
But his refinements were incredible.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.136
He added new linear
motion guides to the pistons,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.016
he added a condenser
to cool the steam outside the cylinder,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.936
he made the engine double-acting,
so it had double the power.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.096
Those were major breakthroughs.
All of the improvements he made --

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.536
and it's justifiable
that our measure of energy, the watt,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.096
today is named after him.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.816
So we looked at this engine,
and this had some potential.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.216
Steam engines are dangerous,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.416
and they had tremendous impact
on the world --

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.696
industrial revolution
and ships and locomotives.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.536
But they're usually good to be large,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.056
so they're not good
for distributed power generation.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.616
They're also very high-pressure,
so they're dangerous.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.216
Another type of engine
is the hot air engine.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.296
And the hot air engine
also was not invented by Robert Stirling,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.376
but Robert Stirling came along in 1816
and radically improved it.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.536
This engine, because it was
so interesting --

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.216
it only worked on air, no steam --

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.976
has led to hundreds
of creative designs over the years

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.336
that use the Stirling engine principle.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.576
But after the Stirling engine,
Otto came along,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.336
and also, he didn't invent
the internal combustion engine,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.576
he just refined it.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.496
He showed it in Paris in 1867,
and it was a major achievement

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.256
because it brought the power density
of the engine way up.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.016
You could now get a lot more power
in a lot smaller space,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.016
and that allowed the engine
to be used for mobile applications.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.496
So, once you have mobility,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.576
you're making a lot of engines
because you've got lots of units,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
as opposed to steam ships
or big factories,

00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:38.895
so this was the engine that ended up
benefiting from mass production

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.616
where all the other engines didn't.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.593
So, because it went into mass production,

00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:45.176
costs were reduced,
100 years of refinement,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.976
emissions were reduced,
tremendous production value.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.496
There have been hundreds of millions
of internal combustion engines built,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.776
compared to thousands
of Stirling engines built.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.776
And not nearly as many
small steam engines being built anymore,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.496
only large ones for big operations.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.176
So after looking
at these three, and 47 others,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.376
we concluded that the Stirling engine
would be the best one to use.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.296
I want to give you a brief explanation
of how we looked at it and how it works.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.976
So we tried to look
at the Stirling engine in a new way,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.536
because it was practical --

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.816
weight no longer mattered
for our application.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.936
The internal combustion engine
took off because weight mattered,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.496
because you were moving around.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.496
But if you're trying to generate
solar energy in a static place

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.176
the weight doesn't matter so much.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.875
We also discovered that efficiency
doesn't matter so much

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.356
if your energy source is free.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.877
Normally, efficiency is crucial

00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:33.837
because the fuel cost
of your engine over its life

00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:35.536
dwarfs the cost of the engine.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.136
But if your fuel source is free,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.736
then the only thing that matters

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.776
is the up-front
capital cost of the engine.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.936
So you don't want
to optimize for efficiency,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.976
you want to optimize for power per dollar.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.216
So using that new twist,
with the new criteria,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.616
we thought we could
relook at the Stirling engine,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.456
and also bring genetic algorithms in.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.416
Basically, Robert Stirling
didn't have Gordon Moore before him

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.576
to get us three gigahertz
of processor power.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.397
So we took the same genetic algorithm

00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:00.638
that we used earlier
to make that concentrator,

00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:02.114
which didn't work out for us,

00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:03.696
to optimize the Stirling engine,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.936
and make its design sizes
and all of its dimensions

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.056
the exact optimum
to get the most power per dollar,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.216
irrespective of weight,
irrespective of size,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.496
just to get the most conversion
of solar energy,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.736
because the sun is free.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.096
And that's the process we took --
let me show you how the engine works.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.776
The simplest heat engine,
or hot air engine, of all time

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.016
would be this -- take a box,
a steel canister, with a piston.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.336
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.376
Take it off the flame
and pour water on it, or let it cool down,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.616
the piston moves down.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.856
That's a heat engine.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.496
That's the most fundamental
heat engine you could have.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.576
The problem is the efficiency
is one hundredth of one percent,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.016
because you're heating
all the metal of the chamber

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.696
and then cooling all the metal
of the chamber each time.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.256
And you're only getting power from the air
that's heating at the same time,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.936
but you're wasting energy
heating and cooling the metal.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.016
So someone came up
with a very clever idea.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.416
Instead of heating and cooling
the whole cylinder,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.456
what about if you put
a displacer inside --

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.936
a little thing that shuttles
the air back and forth.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.456
You move that up and down
with a little bit of energy

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.256
but now you're only shifting the air down
to the hot end and up to the cold end.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.456
So, now you're not alternately heating
and cooling the metal, just the air.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.416
That allows you to get the efficiency up

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.856
from a hundredth of a percent
to about two percent.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.616
And then Robert Stirling
came along with this genius idea,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.136
which was, well, I'm still
not heating the metal now,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.376
with this kind of engine,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.136
but I'm still reheating all the air.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.376
I'm still heating the air every time
and cooling the air every time.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.016
What about if I put
a thermal sponge in the middle,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.936
in the passageway between where the air
has to move between hot and cold?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.616
So he made fine wires, and cracked glass,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.336
and all different kinds of materials
to be a heat sponge.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.416
So when the air pushes up
to go from the hot end to the cold end,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.616
it puts some heat into the sponge.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.296
And then when the air comes back
after it's been cooled,

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.696
it picks up that heat again.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.736
So you're reusing your energy
five or six times,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.736
and that brings the efficiency
up to between 30 and 40 percent.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.096
It's a little known, but brilliant,
genius invention of Robert Stirling

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.136
that takes the hot air engine
from being somewhat impractical --

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.496
like I found out when I made
the real simple version in high school --

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.936
to very potentially possible,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.496
once you get the efficiency up,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.656
if you can design this
to be low enough cost.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.096
So we really set out on a path
to try and make the lowest cost possible.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.256
We built a huge mathematical model
of how a Stirling engine works.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.896
We applied the genetic algorithm.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.376
We got the results from that
for the optimal engine.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.616
We built engines --

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.376
so we built 100 different engines
over the last two years.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.536
We measured each one, we readjusted
the model to what we measured,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.736
and then we led that
to the current prototype.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.896
It led to a very compact,
inexpensive engine,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.816
and this is what the engine looks like.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.080
Let me show you
what it looks like in real life.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.136
So this is the engine.
It's just a small cylinder down here,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.856
which holds the generator
inside and all the linkage,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.216
and it's the hot cap --
the hot cylinder on the top --

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.496
this part gets hot, this part is cool,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.456
and electricity comes out.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.336
The exact converse is also true.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.736
If you put electricity in,
this will get hot and this will get cold,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.056
you get refrigeration.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.896
So it's a complete reversible cycle,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.896
a very efficient cycle,
and quite a simple thing to make.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.816
So now you put the two things together.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.056
So you have the engine.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.936
What if you combine
the petals and the engine in the center?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.936
The petals track and the engine
gets the concentrated sunlight,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.136
takes that heat
and turns it into electricity.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.896
This is what the first prototype
of our system looked like

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.056
with the petals
and the engine in the center.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.696
This is being run out in the sun,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.560
and now I want to show you
what the actual thing looks like.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.616
(Applause)

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.856
Thank you.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.536
So this is a unit with the 12 petals.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.496
These petals cost about a dollar each --

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.256
they're lightweight,
injection-molded plastic, aluminized.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.943
The mechanism to control
each petal is below there,

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.016
with a microprocessor on each one.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.976
There are thermocouples on the engine --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.176
little sensors that detect the heat
when the sunlight strikes them.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.056
Each petal adjusts itself separately
to keep the highest temperature on it.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.296
When the sun comes out in the morning,
the petals will seek the sun,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.656
find it by searching
for the highest temperature.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.616
About a minute and a half or two minutes
after the rays are striking the hot cap

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.536
the engine will be warm enough to start

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.696
and then the engine
will generate electricity

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.616
for about six and a half hours a day --

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.576
six and a half to seven hours
as the sun moves across the sky.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.736
A critical part
that we can take advantage of

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.096
is that we have these
inexpensive microprocessors

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.016
and each of these petals is autonomous,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.496
and each of these petals figures out
where the sun is with no user setup.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.416
So you don't have to tell
what latitude, longitude you're at,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.856
what your roof slope angle is,
or what orientation.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.136
It doesn't really care.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.736
What it does is it searches
to find the hottest spot,

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.696
it searches again a half an hour later,
a day later, a month later.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.936
It basically figures out
where on Earth you are

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.896
by watching the direction the sun moves,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.576
so you don't have to
actually enter anything about that.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.896
The way the unit works is,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.216
when the sun comes out,
the engine will start

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.776
and you get power out here.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.496
We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.736
so that could be used
for certain applications.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.336
We have an inverter in there,
so you get 117 volts AC.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.936
And you also get hot water.
The hot water's optional.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.216
You don't have to use it,
it will cool itself.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.456
But you can use it
to optionally heat hot water

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.616
and that brings
the efficiency up even higher

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.376
because some of the heat
that you'd normally be rejecting,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.776
you can now use as useful energy,
whether it's for a pool or hot water.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.720
Let me show you a quick movie
of what this looks like running.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.296
This is the first test
where we took it outside

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.656
and each of the petals
were individually seeking.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.056
And what they do is step,
very coarsely at first,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.336
and very finely afterward.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.976
Once they get a temperature reading
on the thermocouple

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.456
indicating they found the sun,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.216
they slow down and do a fine search.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.416
Then the petals will move into position,
and the engine will start.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.816
We've been working on this
for the last two years.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.216
We're very excited about the progress,
we have a long way to go though.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.496
This is how we envision
it would be in a residential installation:

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.976
you'd probably have
more than one unit on your roof.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.816
It could be on your roof,
your backyard, or somewhere else.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.816
You don't have to have enough units
to power your entire house,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.376
you just save money
with each incremental one you add.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.496
So you're still using
the grid potentially,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.176
in this type of application,
to be your backup supply --

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.976
of course, you can't use these at night,
and you can't use these on cloudy days.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.416
But by reducing your energy use,
pretty much at the peak times --

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.656
usually when you have
your air conditioning on,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.016
or other times like that --

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.536
this generates the peak power
at the peak usage time,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.536
so it's very complementary in that sense.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.216
This is how we would envision
a residential application.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.976
We also think there's
very big potential for energy farms,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.096
especially in remote land
where there happens to be a lot of sun.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.576
It's a really good combination
of those two factors.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.136
It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun
all around the world, obviously,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.416
but in special places

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.296
where it happens to be
relatively inexpensive to place these

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.176
and also in many more places
where there is high wind power.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.576
So an example of that is,
here's the map of the United States.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.016
Pretty much everywhere that's
not green or blue is a really ideal place,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.056
but even the green or blue areas are good,

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.056
just not as good as the places
that are red, orange and yellow.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.416
But the hot spot right around Las Vegas
and Death Valley is very good.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.520
And is only affects the payback period,

00:16:57.544 --> 00:16:59.976
it doesn't mean that you
couldn't use solar energy;

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.696
you could use it anywhere on Earth.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.376
It just affects the payback period

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.736
if you're comparing
to grid-supplied electricity.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.015
But if you don't have
grid-supplied electricity,

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.736
then the question of payback
is a different one entirely.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.976
It's just how many watts
do you get per dollar,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.216
and how could you benefit from that
to change your life in some way.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.326
This is the map of the whole Earth,

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.407
and you can see
a huge swathe in the middle

00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:22.369
where a large part of the population is,

00:17:22.393 --> 00:17:24.946
there's tremendous chances
for solar energy.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.427
And of course, look at Africa.

00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:29.748
The potential to take advantage
of solar energy there is unbelievable,

00:17:29.772 --> 00:17:33.429
and I'm really excited to talk more
about finding ways we can help with that.

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:37.175
So, in conclusion, I would say
my journey has shown me

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:40.496
that you can revisit
old ideas in a new light,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.216
and sometimes ideas
that have been discarded in the past

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.776
can be practical now if you apply
some new technology or new twists.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.296
We believe we're getting very close
to something practical and affordable.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.496
Our short-term goal for this
is to be half the price of solar cells

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.576
and our longer-term goal
is to be less than a five-year payback.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.736
And at less than a five-year payback,
this becomes very economic.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.816
So you don't have to just have
a feel-good attitude about energy

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.256
to want to have one of these.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.696
It just makes economic sense.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.296
Right now, solar paybacks
are between 30 and 50 years.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.056
If you get it down below five years,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.056
then it's almost a no-brainer
because the interest to own it --

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.776
someone else will finance it for you
and you can just make money from day one.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.376
So that's our real powerful goal

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.576
that we're really
shooting for in the company.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.736
Two other things that I learned
that were very surprising to me --

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.400
one was how casual we are about energy.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.336
I was walking from the elevator over here,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.576
and even just looking
at the stage right now --

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.136
so there's probably
20,500-watt lights right now.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.576
There's 10,000 watts of light
pouring on the stage,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.976
one horsepower
is 746 watts, at full power.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.736
So there's basically 15 horses running
at full speed just to keep the stage lit.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.856
Not to mention the 200 horses
that are probably running right now

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.576
to keep the air-conditioning going.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.816
And it's just amazing,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.696
walk in the elevator,
and there's lights on in the elevator.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.536
Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home
when we leave the lights on by mistake.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.376
But, everywhere around us
we have insatiable use for energy

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.656
because it's so cheap.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.216
And it's cheap because
we've been subsidized by energy

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.976
that's been concentrated by the sun.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.856
Basically, oil is
solar-energy concentrate.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.216
It's been pounded for a billion years
with a lot of energy

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.496
to make it have all that energy
contained in it.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.976
And we don't have a birthright

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.216
to just use that up
as fast as we are, I think.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.416
And it would be great if we could
make our energy usage renewable,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.656
where as we're using the energy,
we're creating it at the same pace,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.376
and I really hope we can get there.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.341
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.
