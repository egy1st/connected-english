00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
sharing some of the problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and making it kind of an annual thing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because I think there are some very important problems

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that don't get worked on naturally.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to do the right things.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And only by paying attention to these things

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
can we make as much progress as we need to.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and talk about where they stand.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is to look at childhood deaths.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's a phenomenal thing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Each one of those lives matters a lot.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but also a few key breakthroughs:

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
vaccines that were used more widely.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
For example, measles was four million of the deaths

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
back as recently as 1990

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and now is under 400,000.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So we really can make changes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Why? Well there's only a few diseases

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Well, what's the history of this disease?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
it's the only disease we can see

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that people who lived in Africa

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So it was absolutely gigantic.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the disease was all over the world.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So it was everywhere.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And so that's why the death rate did come down.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now, ironically, what happened was

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
which is where the rich countries are.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
1945, it's still most places.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And so this leads to the paradox that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it doesn't get much investment.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
than are put into malaria.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And rich men are afflicted.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And so that's why that priority has been set.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But, malaria --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
greatly understate its impact.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
because it just holds things back so much.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Laughter)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Those mosquitos are not infected.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And bed nets are a great tool.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and those nets

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And that's happened now in a number of countries.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's great to see.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But we have to be careful because malaria --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And so you end up with two choices.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you do it vigorously,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you can actually get a local eradication.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the death rate will soar back up again.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now we're on the upswing.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Bed net funding is up.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
There's new drug discovery going on.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that starts in a couple months.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So we're going to have these new tools.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Because the road map to get rid of this disease

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
involves many things.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to keep the visibility high,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to tell the success stories.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It involves social scientists,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but 90 percent.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And so as these elements come together,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I'm quite optimistic

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Now let me turn to a second question,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and we'd understand very well.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And the answer is, really, that we don't.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Let's start with why this is important.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We all had a wonderful education.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
That's part of the reason we're here today,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
part of the reason we're successful.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I had great teachers.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
is starting to fade on a relative basis,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to people with a better education.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And we have to change this.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We have to change it so that the country is strong

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and stays at the forefront

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
of things that are driven by advanced education,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
like science and mathematics.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
When I first learned the statistics,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And that had been covered up for a long time

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
because they always took the dropout rate as the number

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
They had to raise the stated dropout rate

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
as soon as that tracking was done

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to over 30 percent.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And even if you graduate from high school,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
if you're low-income,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
If you're low-income in the United States,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
you have a higher chance of going to jail

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
than you do of getting a four-year degree.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So, how do you make education better?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
There's many people working on it.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We've worked on small schools,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
we've funded scholarships,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we've done things in libraries.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
A lot of these things had a good effect.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
was the very key thing.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And we hooked up with some people studying

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
how much variation is there between teachers,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and the bottom quartile.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
based on test scores --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
by over 10 percent in a single year.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What does that mean?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
had top quartile teachers,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We should retain those people.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What do they look like?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
You might think these must be very senior teachers.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And the answer is no.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Once somebody has taught for three years

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
The variation is very, very small.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
You might think these are people with master's degrees.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
This chart takes four different factors

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
is a master's degree.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
One is seniority.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Teach for America: slight effect.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There are some people who are very good at this.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And we've done almost nothing

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to study what that is

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and to draw it in and to replicate it,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to raise the average capability --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And it's a system with very high turnover.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It's an unbelievable thing.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and what goes on is great teaching.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
They take the poorest kids,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
is very different than in the normal public schools.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
They're taking data, the test scores,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
at first it's very bizarre.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
What's going on?"

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
which kids were bored,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It was a very dynamic environment,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
keeping people engaged and setting the tone

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Everybody needs to be involved.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And so KIPP is doing it.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
How does that compare to a normal school?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
The data isn't gathered.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
In the teacher's contract,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
sometimes to once per year.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And they need advanced notice to do that.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
some of them just making crap

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
They don't have the test scores,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
For example, New York passed a law

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
in the tenure decision for the teachers.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But I'm optimistic about this,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I think there are some clear things we can do.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and that's given us the picture of where we are.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Of course, digital video is cheap now.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Putting a few cameras in the classroom

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is very practical in all public schools.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
You can take those great courses and make them available

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If you have a kid who's behind,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
we can do it much better.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
the place that this is going on --

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And I thought it was so fantastic.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
(Applause)

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Now, we put a lot of money into education,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and it was taken out in the Senate

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
because there are people who are threatened by these things.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
But I -- I'm optimistic.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I only had time to frame those two problems.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
There's a lot more problems like that --

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
just at the very name of these things.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So it's going to take brilliant people like you

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
to study these things, get other people involved --

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
and you're helping to come up with solutions.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Thank you.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:58.000
(Applause)
