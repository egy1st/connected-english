00:00:00.985 --> 00:00:02.528
I am a writer.

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:06.288
Writing books is my profession
but it's more than that, of course.

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:10.212
It is also my great lifelong
love and fascination.

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:13.127
And I don't expect
that that's ever going to change.

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:18.162
But, that said, something
kind of peculiar has happened recently

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:20.411
in my life and in my career,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:25.178
which has caused me to have to recalibrate
my whole relationship with this work.

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:28.812
And the peculiar thing
is that I recently wrote this book,

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:30.780
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:35.345
which, decidedly
unlike any of my previous books,

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.413
went out in the world
for some reason, and became this big,

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.779
mega-sensation, international
bestseller thing.

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:44.845
The result of which
is that everywhere I go now,

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.445
people treat me like I'm doomed.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.327
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:53.018
Like, they come up to me now,
all worried, and they say,

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:57.216
"Aren't you afraid you're never
going to be able to top that?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.462
Aren't you afraid you're going
to keep writing for your whole life

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.629
and you're never again
going to create a book

00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:05.195
that anybody in the world
cares about at all,

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.695
ever again?"

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.044
So that's reassuring, you know.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:12.855
But it would be worse,
except for that I happen to remember

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:16.114
that over 20 years ago,
when I was a teenager,

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.261
when I first started telling people
that I wanted to be a writer,

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.832
I was met with this same
sort of fear-based reaction.

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.666
And people would say, "Aren't you afraid
you're never going to have any success?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.613
Aren't you afraid the humiliation
of rejection will kill you?

00:01:28.637 --> 00:01:32.097
Aren't you afraid that you're going
to work your whole life at this craft

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.977
and nothing's ever going to come of it

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.636
and you're going to die
on a scrap heap of broken dreams

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.127
with your mouth filled
with bitter ash of failure?"

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.480
(Laughter)

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.332
Like that, you know.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:47.493
The answer -- the short answer
to all those questions is, "Yes."

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.793
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.

00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:51.058
And I always have been.

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:53.368
And I'm afraid of many,
many more things besides

00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:55.293
that people can't even guess at,

00:01:55.317 --> 00:01:59.274
like seaweed and other
things that are scary.

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:01.525
But, when it comes to writing,

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.509
the thing that I've been sort of thinking
about lately, and wondering about lately,

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:06.683
is why?

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:07.977
You know, is it rational?

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.224
Is it logical that anybody
should be expected

00:02:10.248 --> 00:02:14.876
to be afraid of the work that they feel
they were put on this Earth to do.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.276
And what is it specifically
about creative ventures

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.748
that seems to make us really nervous
about each other's mental health

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:25.775
in a way that other careers
kind of don't do, you know?

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.798
Like my dad, for example,
was a chemical engineer

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:33.175
and I don't recall once in his 40 years
of chemical engineering

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.857
anybody asking him if he was afraid
to be a chemical engineer, you know?

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:42.668
"That chemical-engineering block,
John, how's it going?"

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:44.832
It just didn't come up
like that, you know?

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:48.666
But to be fair,
chemical engineers as a group

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.214
haven't really earned
a reputation over the centuries

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:53.910
for being alcoholic manic-depressives.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.358
(Laughter)

00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:58.192
We writers, we kind of do have
that reputation,

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:02.175
and not just writers,
but creative people across all genres,

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.876
it seems, have this reputation
for being enormously mentally unstable.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.692
And all you have to do is look
at the very grim death count

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:14.275
in the 20th century alone,
of really magnificent creative minds

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.401
who died young and often
at their own hands, you know?

00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.667
And even the ones
who didn't literally commit suicide

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:24.043
seem to be really undone
by their gifts, you know.

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:26.942
Norman Mailer, just before he died,
last interview, he said,

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:31.043
"Every one of my books
has killed me a little more."

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:34.642
An extraordinary statement
to make about your life's work.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.602
But we don't even blink
when we hear somebody say this,

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:40.208
because we've heard
that kind of stuff for so long

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:44.209
and somehow we've completely
internalized and accepted collectively

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:48.876
this notion that creativity and suffering
are somehow inherently linked

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.942
and that artistry, in the end,
will always ultimately lead to anguish.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.633
And the question that I want
to ask everybody here today

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:59.150
is are you guys all cool with that idea?

00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:01.357
Are you comfortable with that?

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.381
Because you look at it
even from an inch away and, you know --

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:07.508
I'm not at all comfortable
with that assumption.

00:04:07.532 --> 00:04:08.994
I think it's odious.

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:10.947
And I also think it's dangerous,

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.876
and I don't want to see it
perpetuated into the next century.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.750
I think it's better if we encourage
our great creative minds to live.

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:23.525
And I definitely know that,
in my case -- in my situation --

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:28.688
it would be very dangerous for me to start
sort of leaking down that dark path

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:29.909
of assumption,

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:34.062
particularly given the circumstance
that I'm in right now in my career.

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.601
Which is -- you know, like check it out,

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:38.816
I'm pretty young,
I'm only about 40 years old.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.110
I still have maybe another four
decades of work left in me.

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:46.627
And it's exceedingly likely that anything
I write from this point forward

00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:49.604
is going to be judged by the world
as the work that came after

00:04:49.628 --> 00:04:52.927
the freakish success
of my last book, right?

00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:56.889
I should just put it bluntly, because
we're all sort of friends here now --

00:04:56.913 --> 00:05:01.170
it's exceedingly likely
that my greatest success is behind me.

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:03.370
So Jesus, what a thought!

00:05:03.394 --> 00:05:05.800
That's the kind of thought
that could lead a person

00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:08.428
to start drinking gin
at nine o'clock in the morning,

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:11.365
and I don't want to go there.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.423
(Laughter)

00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:14.877
I would prefer to keep doing
this work that I love.

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:18.215
And so, the question becomes, how?

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:21.099
And so, it seems to me,
upon a lot of reflection,

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:24.464
that the way that I have to work now,
in order to continue writing,

00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:28.298
is that I have to create some sort of
protective psychological construct, right?

00:05:28.322 --> 00:05:31.798
I have to sort of find some way
to have a safe distance

00:05:31.822 --> 00:05:36.683
between me, as I am writing,
and my very natural anxiety

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:40.548
about what the reaction to that writing
is going to be, from now on.

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:42.959
And, as I've been looking,
over the last year,

00:05:42.983 --> 00:05:44.816
for models for how to do that,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.964
I've been sort of looking across time,

00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:49.066
and I've been trying
to find other societies

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.816
to see if they might have had
better and saner ideas than we have

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.043
about how to help creative people

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:58.849
sort of manage the inherent
emotional risks of creativity.

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:03.864
And that search has led me
to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

00:06:03.888 --> 00:06:06.555
So stay with me, because
it does circle around and back.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.711
But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.277
people did not happen
to believe that creativity

00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:13.695
came from human beings back then, OK?

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.154
People believed that creativity
was this divine attendant spirit

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:22.155
that came to human beings
from some distant and unknowable source,

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:24.604
for distant and unknowable reasons.

00:06:24.628 --> 00:06:29.855
The Greeks famously called these divine
attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.955
Socrates, famously, believed
that he had a daemon

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.412
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.029
The Romans had the same idea,

00:06:37.053 --> 00:06:41.639
but they called that sort of disembodied
creative spirit a genius.

00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:44.378
Which is great, because the Romans
did not actually think

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:47.172
that a genius was a particularly
clever individual.

00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:50.855
They believed that a genius was this,
sort of magical divine entity,

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:56.177
who was believed to literally
live in the walls of an artist's studio,

00:06:56.201 --> 00:06:58.721
kind of like Dobby the house elf,

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:00.259
and who would come out

00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:02.885
and sort of invisibly assist
the artist with their work

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.354
and would shape the outcome of that work.

00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:09.236
So brilliant -- there it is, right there,
that distance that I'm talking about --

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.438
that psychological construct to protect
you from the results of your work.

00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:17.046
And everyone knew that this
is how it functioned, right?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.737
So the ancient artist was protected
from certain things,

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:22.138
like, for example,
too much narcissism, right?

00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:25.353
If your work was brilliant,
you couldn't take all the credit for it,

00:07:25.377 --> 00:07:29.072
everybody knew that you had this
disembodied genius who had helped you.

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:32.441
If your work bombed,
not entirely your fault, you know?

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.959
Everyone knew your genius
was kind of lame.

00:07:34.983 --> 00:07:36.017
(Laughter)

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.539
And this is how people
thought about creativity in the West

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:40.871
for a really long time.

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:43.471
And then the Renaissance came
and everything changed,

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:45.786
and we had this big idea,
and the big idea was,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.005
let's put the individual human being
at the center of the universe

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:50.570
above all gods and mysteries,

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:52.879
and there's no more room
for mystical creatures

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:54.671
who take dictation from the divine.

00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.806
And it's the beginning
of rational humanism,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.973
and people started
to believe that creativity

00:07:58.997 --> 00:08:01.337
came completely from the self
of the individual.

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.187
And for the first time in history,

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:08.298
you start to hear people referring
to this or that artist as being a genius,

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:10.139
rather than having a genius.

00:08:10.163 --> 00:08:13.463
And I got to tell you,
I think that was a huge error.

00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:17.709
You know, I think that allowing
somebody, one mere person

00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:20.472
to believe that he or she is like,
the vessel,

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:23.068
you know, like the font
and the essence and the source

00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:26.421
of all divine, creative,
unknowable, eternal mystery

00:08:26.445 --> 00:08:32.506
is just a smidge too much responsibility
to put on one fragile, human psyche.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.021
It's like asking somebody
to swallow the sun.

00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:38.672
It just completely warps
and distorts egos,

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:42.222
and it creates all these unmanageable
expectations about performance.

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:44.221
And I think the pressure of that

00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:47.438
has been killing off our artists
for the last 500 years.

00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:50.103
And, if this is true,

00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:51.689
and I think it is true,

00:08:51.713 --> 00:08:54.554
the question becomes, what now?

00:08:54.578 --> 00:08:56.423
Can we do this differently?

00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:59.819
Maybe go back to some more
ancient understanding

00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:04.320
about the relationship between humans
and the creative mystery.

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:05.673
Maybe not.

00:09:05.697 --> 00:09:09.555
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years
of rational humanistic thought

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:11.713
in one 18 minute speech.

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:14.422
And there's probably
people in this audience

00:09:14.446 --> 00:09:18.537
who would raise really
legitimate scientific suspicions

00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:20.916
about the notion of, basically, fairies

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.904
who follow people around rubbing fairy
juice on their projects and stuff.

00:09:25.928 --> 00:09:30.221
I'm not, probably, going to bring
you all along with me on this.

00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:33.006
But the question
that I kind of want to pose is --

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.203
you know, why not?

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:37.125
Why not think about it this way?

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:41.237
Because it makes as much sense
as anything else I have ever heard

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:45.193
in terms of explaining
the utter maddening capriciousness

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.738
of the creative process.

00:09:46.762 --> 00:09:49.953
A process which, as anybody
who has ever tried to make something --

00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:52.043
which is to say basically
everyone here ---

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:55.154
knows does not always behave rationally.

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:59.737
And, in fact, can sometimes
feel downright paranormal.

00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:01.513
I had this encounter recently

00:10:01.537 --> 00:10:05.222
where I met the extraordinary
American poet Ruth Stone,

00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:08.057
who's now in her 90s,
but she's been a poet her entire life

00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:11.287
and she told me that when
she was growing up in rural Virginia,

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.169
she would be out working in the fields,

00:10:13.193 --> 00:10:16.045
and she said she would feel
and hear a poem

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:18.052
coming at her from over the landscape.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.209
And she said it was like
a thunderous train of air.

00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:24.037
And it would come barreling down
at her over the landscape.

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:27.539
And she felt it coming, because it
would shake the earth under her feet.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:30.338
She knew that she had
only one thing to do at that point,

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:32.589
and that was to,
in her words, "run like hell."

00:10:32.613 --> 00:10:34.621
And she would run like hell to the house

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.807
and she would be getting
chased by this poem,

00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:40.437
and the whole deal was that she had
to get to a piece of paper and a pencil

00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:43.842
fast enough so that when it thundered
through her, she could collect it

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:45.048
and grab it on the page.

00:10:45.072 --> 00:10:47.161
And other times
she wouldn't be fast enough,

00:10:47.185 --> 00:10:50.388
so she'd be running and running,
and she wouldn't get to the house

00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:53.226
and the poem would barrel
through her and she would miss it

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.870
and she said it would continue
on across the landscape,

00:10:55.894 --> 00:10:57.978
looking, as she put it "for another poet."

00:10:58.002 --> 00:10:59.648
And then there were these times --

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:01.527
this is the piece I never forgot --

00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:05.009
she said that there were moments
where she would almost miss it, right?

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:08.060
So, she's running to the house
and she's looking for the paper

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.677
and the poem passes through her,

00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:12.311
and she grabs a pencil just
as it's going through her,

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:15.679
and then she said, it was like
she would reach out with her other hand

00:11:15.703 --> 00:11:16.986
and she would catch it.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.967
She would catch the poem by its tail,

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:21.545
and she would pull it
backwards into her body

00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:23.405
as she was transcribing on the page.

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:28.260
And in these instances, the poem would
come up on the page perfect and intact

00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:31.665
but backwards, from the last
word to the first.

00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:33.377
(Laughter)

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:38.094
So when I heard that I was like --
that's uncanny,

00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:40.595
that's exactly what my creative
process is like.

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:44.208
(Laughter)

00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:47.574
That's not at all what my creative
process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

00:11:47.598 --> 00:11:49.628
I'm a mule, and the way
that I have to work

00:11:49.652 --> 00:11:51.895
is I have to get up
at the same time every day,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.729
and sweat and labor and barrel
through it really awkwardly.

00:11:54.753 --> 00:11:56.592
But even I, in my mulishness,

00:11:56.616 --> 00:12:00.460
even I have brushed
up against that thing, at times.

00:12:00.484 --> 00:12:02.723
And I would imagine
that a lot of you have too.

00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:06.028
You know, even I have had work
or ideas come through me from a source

00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:08.539
that I honestly cannot identify.

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:10.135
And what is that thing?

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:14.173
And how are we to relate to it in a way
that will not make us lose our minds,

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:17.059
but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?

00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:20.838
And for me, the best contemporary
example that I have of how to do that

00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:23.170
is the musician Tom Waits,

00:12:23.194 --> 00:12:27.711
who I got to interview several years ago
on a magazine assignment.

00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:29.212
And we were talking about this,

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:32.773
and you know, Tom, for most of his life,
he was pretty much the embodiment

00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:34.893
of the tormented
contemporary modern artist,

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:37.220
trying to control and manage and dominate

00:12:37.244 --> 00:12:39.694
these sort of uncontrollable
creative impulses

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.581
that were totally internalized.

00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:43.586
But then he got older, he got calmer,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.509
and one day he was driving down
the freeway in Los Angeles,

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.445
and this is when it all changed for him.

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.535
And he's speeding along,
and all of a sudden

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:54.081
he hears this little fragment of melody,

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:58.110
that comes into his head as inspiration
often comes, elusive and tantalizing,

00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:00.238
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,

00:13:00.262 --> 00:13:02.563
and he longs for it,
but he has no way to get it.

00:13:02.587 --> 00:13:05.738
He doesn't have a piece of paper,
or a pencil, or a tape recorder.

00:13:05.762 --> 00:13:08.822
So he starts to feel all of that old
anxiety start to rise in him

00:13:08.846 --> 00:13:10.587
like, "I'm going to lose this thing,

00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:12.707
and I'll be be haunted
by this song forever.

00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:14.636
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.670
And instead of panicking, he just stopped.

00:13:16.694 --> 00:13:20.812
He just stopped that whole mental process
and he did something completely novel.

00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:23.295
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:26.309
"Excuse me, can you not
see that I'm driving?"

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:30.010
(Laughter)

00:13:30.034 --> 00:13:32.744
"Do I look like I can write
down a song right now?

00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:36.589
If you really want to exist,
come back at a more opportune moment

00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:38.251
when I can take care of you.

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:41.328
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.

00:13:41.352 --> 00:13:44.624
Go bother Leonard Cohen."

00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:47.756
And his whole work process
changed after that.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.364
Not the work, the work was still
oftentimes as dark as ever.

00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:54.423
But the process, and the heavy
anxiety around it

00:13:54.447 --> 00:13:57.370
was released when he took
the genie, the genius out of him

00:13:57.394 --> 00:14:01.281
where it was causing nothing but trouble,
and released it back where it came from,

00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:04.942
and realized that this didn't have to be
this internalized, tormented thing.

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:08.080
It could be this peculiar,
wondrous, bizarre collaboration,

00:14:08.104 --> 00:14:12.212
kind of conversation between
Tom and the strange, external thing

00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:13.715
that was not quite Tom.

00:14:14.469 --> 00:14:17.152
When I heard that story,
it started to shift a little bit

00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:20.181
the way that I worked too,
and this idea already saved me once.

00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:23.309
It saved me when I was in the middle
of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.842
and I fell into one of those
sort of pits of despair

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:29.322
that we all fall into when we're working
on something and it's not coming

00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:33.506
and you start to think this is going to be
a disaster, the worst book ever written.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.880
Not just bad, but the worst
book ever written.

00:14:35.904 --> 00:14:39.295
And I started to think I should
just dump this project.

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:42.370
But then I remembered Tom
talking to the open air

00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:44.418
and I tried it.

00:14:44.442 --> 00:14:46.910
So I just lifted my face
up from the manuscript

00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:49.840
and I directed my comments
to an empty corner of the room.

00:14:49.864 --> 00:14:53.418
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:56.616
you and I both know
that if this book isn't brilliant

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.417
that is not entirely my fault, right?

00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:01.673
Because you can see that I am putting
everything I have into this,

00:15:01.697 --> 00:15:03.312
I don't have any more than this.

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:07.121
If you want it to be better, you've got
to show up and do your part of the deal.

00:15:07.145 --> 00:15:09.962
But if you don't do that,
you know what, the hell with it.

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:12.668
I'm going to keep writing anyway
because that's my job.

00:15:12.692 --> 00:15:15.128
And I would please
like the record to reflect today

00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:17.150
that I showed up for my part of the job."

00:15:17.174 --> 00:15:20.165
(Laughter)

00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:22.252
Because --

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:24.326
(Applause)

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.498
Because in the end it's like this, OK --

00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:28.899
centuries ago in the deserts
of North Africa,

00:15:28.923 --> 00:15:33.566
people used to gather for these moonlight
dances of sacred dance and music

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.270
that would go on for hours
and hours, until dawn.

00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:39.514
They were always magnificent,
because the dancers were professionals

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.968
and they were terrific, right?

00:15:40.992 --> 00:15:44.289
But every once in a while, very rarely,
something would happen,

00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:47.801
and one of these performers
would actually become transcendent.

00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:50.085
And I know you know
what I'm talking about,

00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.905
because I know you've all seen,
at some point in your life,

00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:54.205
a performance like this.

00:15:54.229 --> 00:15:56.134
It was like time would stop,

00:15:56.158 --> 00:15:59.063
and the dancer would sort of step
through some kind of portal

00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:00.967
and he wasn't doing anything different

00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:03.000
than he had ever done,
1,000 nights before,

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:04.751
but everything would align.

00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:07.918
And all of a sudden, he would
no longer appear to be merely human.

00:16:07.942 --> 00:16:10.317
He would be lit from within,
and lit from below

00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:14.107
and all lit up on fire with divinity.

00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:16.252
And when this happened, back then,

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:20.468
people knew it for what it was,
you know, they called it by its name.

00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:23.635
They would put their hands together
and they would start to chant,

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:27.200
"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."

00:16:27.224 --> 00:16:30.302
That's God, you know.

00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.982
Curious historical footnote:

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:37.823
when the Moors invaded southern Spain,
they took this custom with them

00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:40.133
and the pronunciation
changed over the centuries

00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.933
from "Allah, Allah, Allah,"
to "Olé, olé, olé,"

00:16:42.957 --> 00:16:46.107
which you still hear in bullfights
and in flamenco dances.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.760
In Spain, when a performer has done
something impossible and magic,

00:16:49.784 --> 00:16:52.909
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah,
magnificent, bravo,"

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:55.300
incomprehensible, there it is
-- a glimpse of God.

00:16:56.387 --> 00:16:58.485
Which is great, because we need that.

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.336
But, the tricky bit
comes the next morning,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.763
for the dancer himself,
when he wakes up and discovers

00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:09.210
that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m.,
and he's no longer a glimpse of God.

00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:12.702
He's just an aging mortal
with really bad knees,

00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:16.942
and maybe he's never going
to ascend to that height again.

00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:20.669
And maybe nobody will ever chant
God's name again as he spins,

00:17:20.693 --> 00:17:23.527
and what is he then to do
with the rest of his life?

00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:24.909
This is hard.

00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:27.751
This is one of the most painful
reconciliations to make

00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:29.842
in a creative life.

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:33.025
But maybe it doesn't have to be
quite so full of anguish

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:36.292
if you never happened
to believe, in the first place,

00:17:36.316 --> 00:17:40.397
that the most extraordinary aspects
of your being came from you.

00:17:40.421 --> 00:17:43.258
But maybe if you just believed
that they were on loan to you

00:17:43.282 --> 00:17:46.866
from some unimaginable source
for some exquisite portion of your life

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.906
to be passed along when you're finished,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.756
with somebody else.

00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:55.562
And, you know, if we think about it
this way, it starts to change everything.

00:17:55.586 --> 00:17:57.426
This is how I've started to think,

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.775
and this is certainly how I've been
thinking in the last few months

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:03.704
as I've been working on the book
that will soon be published,

00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:07.259
as the dangerously, frighteningly
over-anticipated follow up

00:18:07.283 --> 00:18:09.919
to my freakish success.

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:12.842
And what I have to
sort of keep telling myself

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:17.042
when I get really psyched out
about that is don't be afraid.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:20.391
Don't be daunted. Just do your job.

00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:23.511
Continue to show up for your piece of it,
whatever that might be.

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:26.276
If your job is to dance, do your dance.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.241
If the divine, cockeyed genius
assigned to your case

00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:35.325
decides to let some sort of wonderment
be glimpsed, for just one moment

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:38.029
through your efforts, then "Olé!"

00:18:38.053 --> 00:18:40.964
And if not, do your dance anyhow.

00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:42.645
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:44.955
I believe this and I feel
that we must teach it.

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:46.433
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,

00:18:46.457 --> 00:18:49.746
just for having the sheer
human love and stubbornness

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.591
to keep showing up.

00:18:51.615 --> 00:18:53.266
Thank you.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.341
(Applause)

00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:56.832
Thank you.

00:18:56.856 --> 00:18:59.946
(Applause)

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.779
June Cohen: Olé!

00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:05.503
(Applause)
