00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
require a certain kind of intellectual activity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because you are always comparing the variation

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with the theme that you hold in your mind.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You might say that the theme is nature

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and everything that follows is a variation on the subject.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was asked, I guess about six years ago,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to do a series of paintings

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it was very difficult for me to imagine

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
how to paint pictures that were based on Piero

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And that was enormously liberating to me.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
based on a work by Piero,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who faces his consort, Battista.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I did the following series of drawings.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's the real Piero della Francesca --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
one of the greatest portraits in human history.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And these, I'll just show these without comment.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
He apparently lost an eye in battle,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which is why he is always shown in profile.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And this is Battista.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Whoops! Passed each other.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And now, four large panels:

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
this is upper left;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
upper right;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
lower left;

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
lower right.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
there doesn't seem to be an argument there.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
On another subject --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
(Laughter) --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I was driving in the country one day with my wife,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and I saw this sign,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And she said, "What are you talking about?"

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and since most people are so suspicious of garages,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and know that they're going to be ripped off,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
they use the word 'reliable.'

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But everybody says they're reliable.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But, reliable Dutchman" --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Laughter) --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
"Fantastic!"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but as soon as you hear Dutchman,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Or even "French."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Laughter)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And so he did.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Alike fantastic if too new or old/

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Be not the first by whom the new are tried/

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I could make nothing of that.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And I really struggled with this one.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So I took another crack at it --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
you've got to keep it moving --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and I pasted them down on an ugly board.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I thought that something would come out of it,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because it's by Alexander Pope,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
but I sort of made a mess out of it,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So, it was going nowhere.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I write down things that I know about it.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But you can see the beginning of an idea there,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That's what happens.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There's a relationship between the old and the new;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the new emerges from the context of the old.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And then I did some variations of it,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I had this other version which had something interesting about it

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
even though they were very fragmentary

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and there wasn't a lot of information in it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then I got the words "new" and "old"

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Laughter)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I was really desperate at this point.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and I put them together.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It says "dreams" at the top.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But, to my credit,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I was so embarrassed about doing that

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that I never submitted this sketch.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but it does have something

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This one generates no imagery at all."

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Which is something you never want to do professionally.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What's the heart of this poem?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I guess one could reduce the idea further

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
like this."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And then I show you a little drawing --

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Well, I found a way to use it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, there's that little alternative over there,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"but more didactic than visual.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
a kind of dance where each defines the other."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
There's a significant difference.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
This could be embarrassing.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Laughter)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And as you know, you have to have a front.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I mean -- you've got to be confident;

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So that's one thing,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
That can be a big contribution.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
you get the big one

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and if you don't like that, how about the little one?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And that too is a relatively new idea.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And here's just a series of experiments

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Now, this is a little illusion.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
That poster is not folded.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It's not folded, that's a photograph

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and it's cut on the diagonal.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And here,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
a very peculiar poster because,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it won't sit still in the space.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and then it shifts.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But, we don't have time.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
(Laughter)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And then an experiment --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
a little bit about the nature of perspective,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is seen frontally.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And another piece for the art directors' club

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and I didn't want to be embarrassed,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
so I worked very hard on this.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
all of which had a different idea of what art is.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is"

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and trying to determine what art was.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And as soon as I said that,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in case you don't get it.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now this says, "Note to the viewer:

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
surrealism has become banal,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
a shadow of its former self.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
The phrase 'Art is whatever'

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
hidden in the word 'whatever.'

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and the shape of the thing.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Whatever."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
(Applause)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
OK.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Applause)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And the one that I did not submit,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
which I still like,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I wanted to use the same phrase.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
on letterforms some years ago --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And that idea stuck in my head.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But what really happens is that you read it as:

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
"Art is whatever remains."

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Thank you.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000
(Applause)
