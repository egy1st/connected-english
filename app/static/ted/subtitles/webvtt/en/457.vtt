00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
playing with blocks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
pick them up and move them around,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you were actually learning how to think and solve problems

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to how we understand a lot of the world around us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, as a computer scientist

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
moving around a flat desktop,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
arranging it the way we wanted?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
by building Siftables.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the size of a cookie.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They're able to be moved around by hand,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and they have a screen and a wireless radio.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Most importantly, they're physical,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of tools for manipulating digital information.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And as these tools become more physical,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
more aware of their motion, aware of each other,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and aware of the nuance of how we move them,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This Siftable is configured to show video,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If they get surrounded, they notice that too,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
they might get a little flustered.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
was that we could use everyday gestures on data,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and I can use them to pour color into that central one,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
where they get mixed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
There are also some neat possibilities for education,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
like language, math and logic games

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and view the results immediately.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So here I'm --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
(Applause)

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Basically, in every round

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Applause)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Thank you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Applause)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
They really loved it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is that you don't have to give people many instructions.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
All you have to say is, "Make words,"

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and they know exactly what to do.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So here's another few people trying it out.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So to him, they were just blocks.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And this is Felix, actually.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And he can bring new characters into the scene,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here, he's bringing the sun out.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Video: The sun is rising.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Video: The orange tractor.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Good job! Yeah!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
he can make the characters interact --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Video: Woof!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
DM: inventing his own narrative.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Video: Hello!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
DM: It's an open-ended story,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and he gets to decide how it unfolds.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Video: Fly away, cat.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is a music sequencing and live performance tool

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that we've built recently,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
in which Siftables act as sounds

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
like lead, bass and drums.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Each of these has four different variations,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you get to choose which one you want to use.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that apply to the entire sequence.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So let's have a look.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
DM: We'll start by putting a lead

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
extend it, add a little more lead.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now I put a bass line in.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
DM: I can speed up the whole sequence

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
by tilting the tempo one way or the other.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Video: (Music)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
making it longer or shorter as I go.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Applause)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Thank you.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, as you can see,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So the thought I want to leave you with

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
for interacting with digital media

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that are going to bring information into our world

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
on our terms.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I look forward to talking with all of you.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Applause)
