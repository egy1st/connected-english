00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:07.870
(Music)

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:15.676
(Music ends)

00:04:16.174 --> 00:04:22.339
(Applause)

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.452
Thank you!

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:39.087
(Applause continues)

00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:41.378
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:47.000
Like the speaker before me --
I am a TED virgin, I guess.

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:50.254
I'm also the first time here, and ...

00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:51.399
(Laughter)

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:52.684
I don't know what to say!

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:56.141
(Applause)

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:58.976
I'm really happy
that Mr. Anderson invited me.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I'm really grateful that I get a chance
to play for everyone.

00:05:02.523 --> 00:05:05.794
And the song that I just played
was by Josef Hofmann.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:07.667
It's called "Kaleidoscope."

00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:14.354
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist
and composer of the late 19th century,

00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.649
and he's widely considered
one of the greatest pianists of all time.

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:20.705
I have another piece
that I'd like to play for you.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.772
It's called "Abegg Variations,"
by Robert Schumann,

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:27.637
a German 19th-century composer.

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:33.145
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.112
and that's the main theme in the melody.

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:37.635
(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)

00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:42.772
That comes from the last name
of one of Schumann's female friends.

00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:45.446
(Laughter)

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.573
But he wrote that for his wife.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.975
(Laughter)

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.541
So actually, if you listen carefully,

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:56.553
there are supposed to be
five variations on this Abegg theme.

00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:59.590
It's written around 1834,

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:01.891
so even though it's old,
I hope you'll like it.

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:10.976
(Music)

00:12:54.987 --> 00:12:56.987
(Music ends)

00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:05.171
(Applause)

00:13:05.748 --> 00:13:07.352
Now comes the part that I hate.

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:13.047
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me

00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:15.948
that this session is called
"Sync and Flow,"

00:13:15.972 --> 00:13:18.969
I was wondering, "What do I know
that these geniuses don't?"

00:13:18.993 --> 00:13:20.160
(Laughter)

00:13:20.184 --> 00:13:22.309
So, I'll talk about musical composition,

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.314
even though I don't know where to start.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.000
How do I compose?

00:13:27.544 --> 00:13:31.055
I think Yamaha does a really good job
of teaching us how to compose.

00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:35.139
What I do first is, I make a lot
of little musical ideas

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.354
you can just improvise
here at the piano --

00:13:37.378 --> 00:13:41.095
and I choose one of those
to become my main theme, my main melody,

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:43.000
like the Abegg that you just heard.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.802
And once I choose my main theme,
I have to decide:

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:50.168
Out of all the styles in music,
what kind of style do I want?

00:13:50.628 --> 00:13:53.219
And this year,
I composed a Romantic style.

00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:57.445
So for inspiration,
I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.444
and all the great Romantic composers.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:05.000
Next, I make the structure
of the entire piece with my teachers.

00:14:05.443 --> 00:14:07.388
They help me plan out the whole piece.

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:11.114
And then the hard part
is filling it in with musical ideas,

00:14:11.138 --> 00:14:13.112
because then you have to think.

00:14:13.136 --> 00:14:14.909
(Laughter)

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:18.412
And then, when the piece
takes somewhat of a solified form --

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.658
solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,

00:14:20.682 --> 00:14:25.708
you're supposed to actually
polish the piece, polish the details,

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:29.000
and then polish the overall
performance of the composition.

00:14:29.843 --> 00:14:32.888
And another thing
that I enjoy doing is drawing.

00:14:32.912 --> 00:14:36.396
Drawing, because I like to draw,
you know, Japanese anime art.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.703
I think that's a craze
among teens right now.

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:41.037
And once I realized it,

00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:45.057
there's a parallel between creating
music and creating art,

00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:50.191
because for your motive, or your
little initial idea for your drawing,

00:14:50.215 --> 00:14:53.183
it's your character -- you want
to decide who you want to draw,

00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:55.363
or if you want to draw
an original character.

00:14:55.387 --> 00:14:58.884
And then you want to decide:
How are you going to draw the character?

00:14:58.908 --> 00:15:02.320
Like, am I going to use one page?
Am I going to draw it on the computer?

00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:05.520
Am I going to use a two-page spread
like a comic book?

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:07.747
For a more grandiose effect, I guess.

00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:11.278
And then you have to do
the initial sketch of the character,

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:13.340
which is like your structure of a piece,

00:15:13.364 --> 00:15:17.124
and then you add pen and pencil,
and whatever details that you need --

00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:18.644
that's polishing the drawing.

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:22.747
And another thing that both of these
have in common is your state of mind,

00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:27.757
because I know I'm one of those teenagers
that are really easily distracted.

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:32.796
So if I'm trying to do homework
and I don't feel like it,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.573
I'll try to draw or,
you know, waste my time.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:38.777
And then what happens is,
sometimes I absolutely can't draw

00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.762
or I can't compose at all,

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:43.092
and then it's like
there's too much on your mind.

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:45.493
You can't focus
on what you're supposed to do.

00:15:45.517 --> 00:15:50.818
And sometimes, if you manage to use
your time wisely and work on it,

00:15:50.842 --> 00:15:53.931
you'll get something out of it,
but it doesn't come naturally.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.970
What happens is,
if something magical happens,

00:15:56.994 --> 00:15:59.598
if something natural happens to you,

00:15:59.622 --> 00:16:03.241
you're able to produce
all this beautiful stuff instantly,

00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:05.393
and then that's what I consider "flow,"

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:09.385
because that's when everything clicks
and you're able to do anything.

00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:13.170
You feel like you're on top of your game
and you can do anything you want.

00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:16.415
I'm not going to play
my own composition today because,

00:16:16.439 --> 00:16:19.000
although I did finish it,
it's way too long.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.238
Instead, I'd like to try something
called "improvisation."

00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:25.483
I have here seven note cards,

00:16:25.507 --> 00:16:28.690
one with each note
of the musical alphabet.

00:16:28.714 --> 00:16:32.597
And I'd like someone to come up here
and choose five --

00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:34.609
anyone to come up here and choose five --

00:16:34.633 --> 00:16:37.345
and then I can make it
into some sort of melody,

00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:38.749
and I'll improvise it.

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:42.842
Wow. A volunteer, yay!

00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:44.340
(Laughter)

00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:47.490
(Applause)

00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:49.125
Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.620
Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.706
JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.296
GH: OK, one.
JL: OK.

00:16:57.185 --> 00:16:58.756
GH: Two.
JL: Yes.

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:01.176
GH: Three.

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:05.508
GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.

00:17:05.532 --> 00:17:10.141
(Laughter)

00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:13.501
JL: One more.
GH: OK. "E" for "effort."

00:17:13.525 --> 00:17:16.796
JL: Would you mind reading them out
in the order that you chose them?

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:23.111
GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.

00:17:23.135 --> 00:17:24.289
JL: Thank you very much!

00:17:24.313 --> 00:17:26.289
GH: You're welcome. And what about these?

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:28.839
JL: I won't use them. Thank you!

00:17:30.204 --> 00:17:36.461
(Applause)

00:17:37.152 --> 00:17:40.530
Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:42.974
I'm going to try to put that
in some sort of order.

00:17:42.998 --> 00:17:46.510
(Plays notes)

00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:50.344
OK, that's nice.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.973
So, I'm going to have a moment to think,

00:17:52.997 --> 00:17:55.239
and I'll try to make something out of it.

00:18:00.134 --> 00:18:03.382
(Plays the five notes)

00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:17.897
(Music)

00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:29.202
(Music ends)

00:21:29.226 --> 00:21:36.004
(Applause)

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.592
The next song, or the encore
that I'm going to play

00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:42.000
is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.

00:21:42.979 --> 00:21:44.288
(Applause)

00:21:47.689 --> 00:21:53.414
(Music)

00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:41.522
(Music ends)

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:48.000
(Applause)
