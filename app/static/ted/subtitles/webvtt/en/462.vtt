00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In his inaugural address,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But what did he appeal to?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and tell us to just go shopping.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Invest, invest, invest."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And he appealed to virtue.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And besides, some of you might be wondering,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what the hell does it mean?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let me begin with an example.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is the job description of a hospital janitor

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that is scrolling up on the screen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They're the things you would expect:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It may be a little surprising how many things there are,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but it's not surprising what they are.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
even though this is a very long list,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Not one.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they encountered Mike,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
because there were some family members who were there all day, every day

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then there was Luke,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
didn't see Luke do it the first time,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and his father was angry.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
doesn't just make people feel a little better,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
it actually improves the quality of patient care

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and enables hospitals to run well.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
involving kindness, care and empathy

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
are an essential part of the job.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
A wise person knows how to improvise,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and the context is always changing.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
A wise person is like a jazz musician --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in the service of the right aims.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And finally, perhaps most important,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
a wise person is made, not born.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Wisdom depends on experience,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and not just any experience.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You need permission to be allowed to improvise,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
how hard it is to learn to do their job,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
At TED, brilliance is rampant.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's scary.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The bad news is that without wisdom,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
brilliance isn't enough.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
(Applause)

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now, I hope that we all know this.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There's a sense in which it's obvious,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and yet, let me tell you a little story.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's a story about lemonade.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
His son asked him for some lemonade

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
which was five percent alcohol.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So he brought it back.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and called the police, who called an ambulance

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And they were ready to let the kid go.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But not so fast.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
At that point, can the child go home?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
After two weeks, I'm happy to report,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
the family was reunited.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and the judge all said the same thing:

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
How do things like this happen?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but they spare you from thinking."

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because previous officials have been lax

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and they let a child go back to an abusive household.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Fair enough.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
When things go wrong, as of course they do,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we reach for two tools to try to fix them.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
One tool we reach for is rules.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Better ones, more of them.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The second tool we reach for is incentives.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Better ones, more of them.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
What else, after all, is there?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Regulate, regulate, regulate.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
are enough to do the job.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's preposterous on its face.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
but they create a downward spiral

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that makes them worse in the long run.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that deprives us of the opportunity

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to improvise and learn from our improvisations.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And moral will is undermined

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
by an incessant appeal to incentives

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that destroy our desire to do the right thing.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And without intending it,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
by appealing to rules and incentives,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we are engaging in a war on wisdom.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Let me just give you a few examples,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
first of rules and the war on moral skill.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The lemonade story is one.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Second, no doubt more familiar to you,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is the nature of modern American education:

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
scripted, lock-step curricula.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Reading and enjoying literature

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and words that begin with 'B.'

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
We know why these scripts are there.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to let them loose on their own.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And they prevent disaster.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
(Applause)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Don't get me wrong. We need rules!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Jazz musicians need some notes --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
most of them need some notes on the page.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
from improvising.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And as a result, they lose their gifts,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
or worse, they stop playing altogether.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now, how about incentives?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
They seem cleverer.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
If you have one reason for doing something

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and you're more likely to do it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Right?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Well, not always.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
instead of complimenting,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and they make people less likely to do it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
There was going to be a national referendum.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They knew it was dangerous.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They thought it would reduce their property values.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But it had to go somewhere

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and they had responsibilities as citizens.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Instead of 50 percent saying yes,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
25 percent said yes.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
What happens is that

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the second this introduction of incentive gets us

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
When incentives don't work,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
the response is always the same.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Get smarter incentives.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that are ever going to be smart enough.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
We need incentives. People have to make a living.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
But excessive reliance on incentives

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
demoralizes professional activity

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in two senses of that word.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And when professions are demoralized,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and they stop asking "Is it right?"

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We see this in medicine.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And we certainly see it in the world of business.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So what can we do?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
A few sources of hope:

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
we ought to try to re-moralize work.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
(Applause)

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
What to do instead?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Acknowledge, when you go to law school,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that a little voice is whispering in your ear

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
about Atticus Finch.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
People are inspired by moral heroes.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But we learn that with sophistication

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Well, acknowledge them.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Be proud that you have them.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Celebrate them.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That's one thing we can do.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I don't know how many of you remember this:

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
they made Polartec --

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
The factory burned down.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and for the community if he had let them go.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Two were particularly inspiring to me.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(Applause)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And a bonus he's discovering is

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
he's actually going to make even more money.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
His employees are inspired by the effort.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
(Applause)

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
In many ways this is the perfect example.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Because it took the will to do the right thing.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
in order to plot this out.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
But most important to make it work --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and he emphasized this --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
is that it took knowing the people in the communities.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Unless the people you're working with are behind you,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
this will fail.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
because different people in different communities

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
organize their lives in different ways.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
There are ordinary heroes.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
As heads of organizations,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
we should strive to create environments

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
will give up if they have to swim against the current

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
in the organizations in which they work.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
If you run an organization, you should be sure

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Because the truth is that

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
is moral work.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And, perhaps most important,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
One is that we are always teaching.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Someone is always watching.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The camera is always on.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
"Knowledge is power."

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that KIPP is doing

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
that Bill didn't mention.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
That is that they have come to the realization

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
that the single most important thing kids need to learn

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
is character.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
They need to learn to respect themselves.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
They need to learn to respect their teachers.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
That's the principle objective.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Obama appealed to virtue.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And I think he was right.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
He also appealed to hope.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Right again.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I think there is reason for hope.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Wanting to do the right thing

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
in the right way

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
for the right reasons.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
if only we start paying attention.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Paying attention to what we do,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
to how we do it,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and, perhaps most importantly,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
to the structure of the organizations within which we work,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
rather than having it suppressed.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Thank you.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
(Applause)

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(Applause)
