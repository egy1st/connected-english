00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's start talking about that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's what I have behind myself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Laughter)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But of course what we have to remember is this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And what you have to think about is,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is I'm going to talk first about the flames --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where we are in the economy --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then I'm going to take three trends

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and that will take place in this conference

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and I will try and bring them together.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Those three trends are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the ability to engineer cells,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the ability to engineer tissues,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and robots.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And somehow it will all make sense.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But anyway, let's start with the economy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
One is leverage.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the problem with leverage is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it's an investment bank;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it has 15 to 20 times.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oops.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
are making such generous and wonderful donations

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to these nice folks.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And as you think about that,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
(Laughter)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It ain't pretty.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We all love Santa Claus, right?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But the problem with Santa Clause is,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and promising folks,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
on what we call "entitlements."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that we've brought that date of reckoning forward


00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to about 2017.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but, guess what?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We're going to start to pay them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Right?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And he gave an interview in December.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Here's his first bit of advice.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And here's his second bit of advice.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And, by the way,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This stuff is getting serious enough

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
we're going to end up losing the dollar.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And then all bets are off.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I think I can safely say

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
This is an actual bill.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And it's 10 triliion dollars.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
a buck next week.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
you've just got to say no.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And the reason we have to do that in the short term

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is because we have just run out of cash.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
The orange slice is what's discretionary.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Everything else is mandated.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So what we have to start thinking about doing

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
is capping our medical spending

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We've got to start thinking about asking people

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to retire a little bit later.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Your 401(k) just got nailed.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The reason why that's reasonable is,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
when your grandparents were given Social Security,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Sixty-eight is young today.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We've got to quit borrowing as much,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And if we don't start changing this trend line,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
we are going to lose the dollar

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and start to look like Iceland.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I got what you're thinking.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
back in the late '80s.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And its 225 largest companies today

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We don't fix this now,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And unless you want this person

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we'd better deal with this stuff.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
That's the short term. That's the flame part.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That's the financial crisis.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that we need to talk about.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
That wave is much larger, much more powerful,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and that's of course the wave of technology.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And what's really important in this stuff is,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
as we cut, we also have to grow.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Among other things, because startup companies

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and they're about 17.8 percent of output.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And that's what we've got to keep growing.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And that's where these three trends come together.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
That's where the ability to engineer microbes,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the ability to engineer tissues,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and the ability to engineer robots

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
begin to lead to a reboot.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Craig Venter showed up last year

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
In parallel, the folks at MIT

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
have been building a standard registry of biological parts.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And start building stuff.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and started to build these little odd creatures.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Here was one of the first things they built.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So, cells have this cycle.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
First they don't grow.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Then they grow exponentially.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Then they stop growing.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So they engineered these cells

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
they would smell like wintergreen.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
This got a bit more complicated two years later.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They started competing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that makes red wine good for you

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
into beer.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that they would act as your kidneys.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And people oohed and ahhed,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that was very cool stuff back then.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
let me show you what's happened in that period of time.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Two years ago, you saw this creature.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
called an axolotl

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that can re-generate its limbs.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It's almost like leaving Congress.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
This should not surprise you, right?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I mean, you're born with no teeth.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
You re-grow a set of teeth.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
unless, if you're a lawyer.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But, of course, for most of us,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and simply implant it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And we can do it with other things.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
they took all the cells off the trachea,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
She regrew her own trachea,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and 72 hours later it was implanted.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
She's now running around with her kids.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and he's also re-growing bladders.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So there are now nine women walking around Boston

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
with re-grown bladders,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
for the rest of your life.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This is kind of getting boring, right?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I mean, you understand where this story's going.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But, I mean it gets more interesting.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
leaving just the cartilage.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Life happens.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This may be one of the ultimate papers.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
That meant that you can take the stuff right here,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and turn it into almost anything in your body.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it's moving in a whole series of places.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Third trend: robots.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And all we've got is a Roomba.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Didn't happen.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, Rosie runs around on skates

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and the other one ran on flat threads.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that's when computers have reached human intelligence.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
This is not an intelligence Turing rest,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And this stuff is moving very quickly,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
These are not the only interesting robots.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You've also got flies, the size of flies,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And as you bring these things together,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
you begin to get some really odd questions.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
In the last Olympics, this gentleman,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
who had several world records in the Special Olympics,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
tried to run in the normal Olympics.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
He came within about a second of qualifying.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
He sued to be allowed to run,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and he won the suit,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
but didn't qualify by time.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is going to make the time.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and then your parents had these odd boxes

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that would squawk at odd times during dinner,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And now you have cochlear implants

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and these are machine generations, not human generations.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
They'll be able to focus their hearing,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
do a series of things that we can't do.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And the same thing is happening in eyes.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Very primitive.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And then they'll be able to see shape.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
they'll be able to come into a microfocus.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
All of these things are coming together,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and it's a particularly important thing to understand,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as we worry about the flames of the present,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to keep an eye on the future.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
There have actually been 22 species of hominids

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
have gone extinct.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It is common for hominids to evolve.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and Homo sapiens, all overlap.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
not one.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And as you think of the implications of that,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
here's a brief history of the universe.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and then you got life about four billion years ago,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Ta-dah!

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
is to create what's in this room.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Maybe not.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
(Laughter)

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
(Laughter)

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I think most of us are going to glance at it,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
(Applause)
