WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we captured a couple weeks ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I am overjoyed today

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at being awarded the TED Prize

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
on behalf of all

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the distinguished music teachers,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
artists and educators from Venezuela

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Since I was a boy,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in my early childhood,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I always wanted to be a musician,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and, thank God, I made it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
From my teachers, my family and my community,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I had all the necessary support to become a musician.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All my life I've dreamed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that all Venezuelan children

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
have the same opportunity that I had.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
From that desire and from my heart

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
stemmed the idea to make music

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
a deep and global reality for my country.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I had received a donation of 50 music stands

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and I said to myself,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
into one of the leading orchestras in the world.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
when a distinguished English critic

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
published an article in the London Times,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
He mentioned four great world orchestras,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Today we can say

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that art in Latin America

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is no longer a monopoly of elites

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and that it has become a social right,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a right for all the people.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Child: There is no difference here between classes,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Simply, if you are talented,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
if you have the vocation and the will to be here,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
you get in. You share with us and make music.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
JA: During the recent tour

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of U.S. and Europe,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we saw how our music moved young audiences

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to the bottom of their souls,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to receive the jackets from our musicians,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
seemed to last forever,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and how the public, after the concert was over,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This meant not only an artistic triumph,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but also a profound emotional sympathy

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
between the public of the most advanced nations of the world

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and the musical youth of Latin America,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
as seen in Venezuela,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000
giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
enthusiasm and strength.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
In its essence, the orchestra and the choir

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
are much more than artistic structures.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
They are examples and schools of social life,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because to sing and to play together

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
means to intimately coexist

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
toward perfection and excellence,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
following a strict discipline of organization and coordination

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in order to seek the harmonic interdependence

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of voices and instruments.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and fraternity among them,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
develop their self-esteem

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and foster the ethical and aesthetical values

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
related to the music in all its senses.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
This is why music is immensely important

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and in the training of youngsters

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to teach other kids.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Child: After all this time here,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
music is life.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Nothing else.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Music is life.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and they are all important and of great significance to me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
who passionately attended to his double bass lessons

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
With his effort,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and the support of his mother, his family and his community,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
he became a principal member

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in his hometown, Barquisimeto.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and he's an unbeatable example

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
for young musicians in Latin America and the world.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The structure of El Sistema

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is based on a new and flexible managing style

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
adapted to the features of each community and region,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
all over Venezuela.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's a program of social rescue

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and deep cultural transformation

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
designed for the whole Venezuelan society

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in the personal/social circle,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in the family circle and in the community.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
In the personal/social circle,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the children in the orchestras and choirs

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
develop their intellectual and emotional side.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The music becomes a source

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
for developing the dimensions of the human being,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
thus elevating the spirit

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and leading man to a full development of his personality.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the sense of commitment, responsibility,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
generosity and dedication to others,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Mother Teresa of Calcutta

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
insisted on something that always impressed me:

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is not the lack of bread or roof,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but the feeling of being no-one --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the feeling of not being anyone,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the lack of identification,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the lack of public esteem.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
That's why the child's development

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in the orchestra and the choir

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
provides him with a noble identity

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and makes him a role model for his family and community.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It makes him a better student at school

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000
perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The child becomes a role model for both his parents,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and this is very important for a poor child.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Once the child discovers he is important to his family,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
he begins to seek new ways of improving himself

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and hopes better for himself and his community.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and progress in the various opportunities

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that music has to offer.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Finally, in the circle of the community,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and sources of exchange and new meanings.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
The spontaneity music has

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It's what makes a child play a violin at home,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
while his father works in his carpentry.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
while her mother does the housework.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that their children belong to.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
which also lies within itself,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ends up overcoming material poverty.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
he's no longer poor.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
who'll later become a full citizen.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Needless to say that music is the number one prevention

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
against prostitution, violence, bad habits,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and everything degrading in the life of a child.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I believe that to confront such a crisis,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to mankind's deepest aspirations,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and to the historic demands of our times.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
more noble and more just society.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:16.000
With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:25.000
for its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000
for its open and generous promotion of young values.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to the building of this new era in the teaching of music,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.000
in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
of the child and the adolescent

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
No longer putting society at the service of art,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
but instead art at the service of society,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and at the service of all those who cry for vindication

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
through the spirit of their human condition

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and the raising up of their dignity.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Music)

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
(Applause)

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
CA: We are going live now to Caracas.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We are going live to Caracas

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
JA: Here is my TED Prize wish:

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I wish that you'll help to create and document

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a special training program

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
for 50 gifted young musicians,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
passionate about their art and social justice,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and other countries.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
