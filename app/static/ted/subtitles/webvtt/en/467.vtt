00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to share with you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
actually, we've taken, we've eaten --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
should concern not only the creatures that are dying,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but it really should concern you.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It does concern you, as well.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
asking why we didn't do something on our watch

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
while there still was time.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Well, now is that time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I hope for your help

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to explore and protect the wild ocean

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in ways that will restore the health and,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in so doing, secure hope for humankind.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Health to the ocean means health for us.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and other sea creatures

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I hope, Jill, that someday

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Did I say that? I guess I did.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
For me, as a scientist,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
it all began in 1953

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
when I first tried scuba.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's when I first got to know fish swimming

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in something other than lemon slices and butter.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I actually love diving at night;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
while using this personal submersible called Jim.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to design and build systems

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to access the deep sea.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the Sustainable Seas expeditions,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
using these little subs.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I'm living proof.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Astronauts and aquanauts alike

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and then do everything he could

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to take care of his life support system;

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We need to learn everything we can about it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and do everything we can to take care of it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
none without water."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
No blue, no green.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
If you think the ocean isn't important,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
imagine Earth without it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Mars comes to mind.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
No ocean, no life support system.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and I showed this amazing image of Earth

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
That's where all the assets are!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And we've been trawling them down

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
With every drop of water you drink,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
every breath you take,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you're connected to the sea.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
No matter where on Earth you live.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
has been absorbed and stored there,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
mostly by microbes.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The ocean drives climate and weather,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Water from the sea forms clouds

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that return to the land and the seas

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
as rain, sleet and snow,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
maybe in the universe.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
No water, no life;

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
no blue, no green.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Yet we have this idea, we humans,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are so vast and so resilient

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it doesn't matter what we do to it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That may have been true 10,000 years ago,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and maybe even 1,000 years ago

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but in the last 100, especially in the last 50,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
we've drawn down the assets,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the air, the water, the wildlife

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that make our lives possible.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
New technologies are helping us to understand

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the nature of nature;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the nature of what's happening,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
showing us our impact on the Earth.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And fortunately, in our time,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And with knowing comes caring.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And with caring, there's hope

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that we can find an enduring place for ourselves

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
within the natural systems that support us.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But first we have to know.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Three years ago, I met John Hanke,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
who's the head of Google Earth,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and go exploring vicariously.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
What about the water?"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
with DOER Marine, with National Geographic,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
ones that we could enlist,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to put the ocean in Google Earth.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And as of just this week, last Monday,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Google Earth is now whole.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
we can find the nearby aquarium,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
we can look at where we're sitting,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and California's four national marine sanctuaries,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and the new network of state marine reserves

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We can flit over to Hawaii

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and see the real Hawaiian Islands:

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
not just the little bit that pokes through the surface,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
but also what's below.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
right there, ha --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
under the ocean, see what the whales see.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and visit with humpback whales.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
many times underwater.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place:

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
seven miles down, the Mariana Trench,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
where only two people have ever been.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Imagine that. It's only seven miles,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
One-way trips are easy.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We need new deep-diving submarines.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and understand life in the deep sea.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We can now go to the Arctic.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That's bad news for the polar bears.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
That's bad news for us too.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
it's also changing ocean chemistry,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
making the sea more acidic.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Also it's bad news for us.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and other trash into the sea.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
gear that continues to kill.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
all carbon-based units.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the oxygen cycle, the water cycle --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
our life support system.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and much more valuable alive than dead.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
All of these parts are part of our life support system.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that may stretch for 50 miles or more.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
shaking the foundation of our life support system,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
leaving plumes of death in their path.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
think of the real cost.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
For every pound that goes to market,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
may be thrown away as bycatch.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This is the consequence of not knowing

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
from 1900 to 2000.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The highest concentrations are in red.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
In my lifetime, imagine,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
90 percent of the big fish have been killed.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
are way down in numbers.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But, there is good news.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
There are still some blue whales.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There are still some krill in Antarctica.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
There's still time, but not a lot,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to turn things around.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But business as usual means that in 50 years,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
there may be no coral reefs --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Imagine the ocean without fish.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Imagine what that means to our life support system.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but the problems are more obvious,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the United States began establishing a system of parks

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that some say was the best idea America ever had.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
National Marine Sanctuaries.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
That's another great idea.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The good news is

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that have some kind of protection.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And you can find them on Google Earth.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The bad news is

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that you have to look hard to find them.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
In the last three years, for example,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Protected areas do rebound,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but it takes a long time to restore

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
or 200-year-old orange roughy.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Protected areas provide hope

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
will live not just as a list,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
a photograph, or a paragraph.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to search out hope spots,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Such as the Arctic --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
we have one chance, right now, to get it right.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is being gathered up to feed cows.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It's true too in Argentina

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
filled with luminous creatures,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
living in dark waters that average two miles deep.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
They flash, and sparkle, and glow

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
with their own living light.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The next 10 years may be the most important,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But, nothing else will matter

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
if we fail to protect the ocean.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Our fate and the ocean's are one.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
A global plan of action

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
with a world conservation union, the IUCN,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
is underway to protect biodiversity,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
on the high seas and in coastal areas,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
wherever we can identify critical places.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
The goal is to protect biodiversity,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
to provide stability and resilience.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We need deep-diving subs,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
new technologies to explore the ocean.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We need, maybe, an expedition --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
a TED at sea --

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
that could help figure out the next steps.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I wish you would use all means at your disposal --

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
films, expeditions, the web, new submarines --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and campaign to ignite public support

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
for a global network of marine protected areas --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
the blue heart of the planet.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
How much?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Whatever it is,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
a fraction of one percent is not enough.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
My wish is a big wish,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and help ensure the survival

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species;

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
that would be us.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
For the children of today,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
for tomorrow's child:

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
as never again, now is the time.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:48.000
(Applause)
