00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, my question:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
are we alone?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The story of humans is the story of ideas --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
ideas that have vanished in history,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and ideas that have been set in dogma.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a story of nations,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of ideologies,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of territories,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and of conflicts among them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But, every moment of human history,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
from the Stone Age to the Information Age,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
they've all been carried out --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
every book that you've read,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
every poem, every laugh, every tear --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
they've all happened here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Here.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Perspective is a very powerful thing.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Perspectives can change.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Perspectives can be altered.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
in a universe of possibilities.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
about who we are and why we are,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and of course, who else might be out there.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Is it really just us?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Are we alone in this vast universe

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But, what if we're not?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but from the opposite side?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
inspire us to find ways to survive

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and our common cosmic origins

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We, all of us,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Fifty years ago,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the journey to find answers took a different path

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
began.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So, what exactly is SETI?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and theirs might be as well.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It might be that some massive network of communications,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
or some shield against asteroidal impact,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that a determined program of searching might detect.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
rather than ask what should be, believed.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
including the small planet, announced earlier this week,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
altogether 10^22 stars.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Remember, one billion?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Alright, one billion stars.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that's 10 trillion.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Well, what about 10^22?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Where's the line that marks that?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(Laughter)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
16 times farther away than the moon,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
or four percent of the distance to the sun.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So, there are many possibilities.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And much of this vast universe,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
much more may be habitable than we once thought,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
as we study extremophiles on Earth --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Even our nearest star, the Sun --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
not their present.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It tells us about their past,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The first is that problems are inevitable.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The second is that problems are soluble.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is the longevity of technologies,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
distance over space and distance over time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
If technologies don't last and persist,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we will not succeed.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And we're a very young technology

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in an old galaxy,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Let me talk about a relatively small number.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
there was abundant water and perhaps even life.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
developing life,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
not anticipating its emergence.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Life happened very quickly,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is the very narrow range of time

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's only the last few hundred thousand years

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So, one needs a very deep appreciation

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000
as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We are not the determined product

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We are residents of one small planet

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
on a very extensive Tree of Life,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
over millions of years.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We misuse language,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and talk about the "ascent" of man.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but our ego hasn't caught up yet.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
has got to go.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Loren Eiseley has said,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
"One does not meet oneself

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and perhaps SETI will help as well.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Occasionally, throughout history, this concept

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,"

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and by taking the Earth out of the center,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and putting the sun in the center of the solar system,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
he opened our eyes to a much larger universe,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
of which we are just a small part.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And that Copernican revolution continues today

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
published the first SETI article in a refereed journal,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
for about 150 hours.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
with the search for extraterrestrial technology.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We've been searching ever since,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
on the basis of one glass of water.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
much bigger glasses.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
who have so generously supported this research.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:48.000
(Applause)

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and hooked together with computers.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's making silicon as important as aluminum,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Today, our signal detection algorithms

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
can find very simple artifacts and noise.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the most distant human object in the universe,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
106 times as far away from us as the sun is.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It may be hard for your eye to see it,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But this is a simple signal,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is a very good year.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Darwin's 200th birthday,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,"

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
the targets for SETI's searches.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
a global festival to help us residents of Earth

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And in 2009, change has come to Washington,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
with a promise to put science in its rightful position.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
(Applause)

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
So, what would change everything?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and four of the respondents said, "SETI."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Why?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Well, to quote:

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that has plagued our species since its inception.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And it wouldn't simply change everything,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
it would change everything all at once."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I think it's a problem of completion and delivery,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
because the fine print said,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
would you expect to live to see?"

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So, we have a fulfillment problem.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and then working together, maybe we can all live to see

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
That brings me to my wish.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
to become active participants

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
in the ultimate search for cosmic company.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
to build an environment where raw data could be stored,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and where it could be accessed and manipulated,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And this is a technically creative challenge,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and get them out to students everywhere,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
We'd like to tell our story better,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
into smaller islands.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
to Earthlings.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And SETI is a mirror --

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
a mirror that can show us ourselves

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
from an extraordinary perspective,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and can help to trivialize the differences among us.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So, in the opening days of 2009,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and said, "We cannot help but believe

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
that the old hatreds shall someday pass,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So, I look forward to working with the TED community

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
and in collaborating with you,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Thank you.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:57.000
(Applause)
