00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:05.762
We've been told to go out on a limb
and say something surprising.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:06.976
So I'll try and do that,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.496
but I want to start with two things
that everyone already knows.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.781
And the first one, in fact,
is something that has been known

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:20.058
for most of recorded history,

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:24.859
and that is, that the planet Earth,
or the solar system,

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.805
or our environment or whatever,

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.247
is uniquely suited
to sustain our evolution --

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:37.080
or creation, as it used to be thought --

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:43.426
and our present existence,
and most important, our future survival.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:48.223
Nowadays, this idea
has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.509
And the idea there
is that outside the spaceship,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.446
the universe is implacably hostile,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.246
and inside is all we have,
all we depend on,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.477
and we only get the one chance:
if we mess up our spaceship,

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.374
we've got nowhere else to go.

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.100
Now, the second thing
that everyone already knows

00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:11.569
is that, contrary to what was believed
for most of human history,

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:17.387
human beings are not, in fact,
the hub of existence.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.652
As Stephen Hawking famously said,

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:24.572
we're just a chemical scum
on the surface of a typical planet

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:26.882
that's in orbit around a typical star,

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:30.804
which is on the outskirts
of a typical galaxy, and so on.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.782
Now, the first of those two things
that everyone knows is kind of saying

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:42.045
that we're at a very untypical place,
uniquely suited and so on.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.926
And the second one is saying
that we're at a typical place.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.811
And, especially if you regard
these two as deep truths to live by

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.976
and to inform your life decisions,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.297
then they seem a little bit
to conflict with each other.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.837
But that doesn't prevent them
from both being completely false.

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:05.242
(Laughter)

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.596
And they are.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:13.837
So let me start
with the second one: typical.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.151
Well, is this a typical place?

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:20.140
Well, let's look around, you know,
look in a random direction,

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:25.753
and we see a wall and chemical scum --

00:02:25.777 --> 00:02:27.163
(Laughter)

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:31.828
and that's not typical
of the universe at all.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:35.319
All you've got to do is go
a few hundred miles in that same direction

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:36.515
and look back,

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.824
and you won't see any walls
or chemical scum at all --

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:41.634
all you see is a blue planet.

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:44.277
And if you go further than that,

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:48.590
you'll see the Sun, the solar system
and the stars and so on,

00:02:48.614 --> 00:02:50.745
but that's still not typical
of the universe,

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.152
because stars come in galaxies.

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:58.895
And most places in the universe,
a typical place in the universe,

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.976
is nowhere near any galaxies.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.698
So let's go out further,
till we're outside the galaxy,

00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:06.883
and look back,

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:11.409
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy
with spiral arms laid out in front of us.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.760
And at this point, we've come
100,000 light-years from here.

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.976
But we're still nowhere near
a typical place in the universe.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.749
To get to a typical place,

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:29.290
you've got to go
1,000 times as far as that,

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:31.394
into intergalactic space.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.913
And so, what does that
look like -- "typical?"

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:37.486
What does a "typical" place
in the universe look like?

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.520
Well, at enormous expense,
TED has arranged

00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:46.737
a high-resolution immersion
virtual reality rendering

00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:50.086
of the view from intergalactic space.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.954
Can we have the lights off,
please, so we can see it?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.366
Well, not quite, not quite perfect.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.071
You see, intergalactic space
is completely dark, pitch dark.

00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:09.978
It's so dark,

00:04:10.002 --> 00:04:15.690
that if you were to be looking
at the nearest star to you,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.841
and that star were to explode
as a supernova,

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:24.702
and you were to be staring directly at it
at the moment when its light reached you,

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:27.876
you still wouldn't be able
to see even a glimmer.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.762
That's how big and how dark
the universe is.

00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:36.659
And that's despite the fact
that a supernova is so bright,

00:04:36.683 --> 00:04:39.128
so brilliant an event,

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:43.282
that it would kill you stone dead
at a range of several light-years.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:44.925
(Laughter)

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.864
And yet, from intergalactic space,

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:49.323
it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.

00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:52.360
It's also very cold out there --

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:55.529
less than three degrees
above absolute zero.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:57.411
And it's very empty.

00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:03.393
The vacuum there is one million times
less dense than the highest vacuum

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:06.237
that our best technology on Earth
can currently create.

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:13.025
So that's how different
a typical place is from this place.

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:16.127
And that is how untypical this place is.

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.222
So can we have the lights
back on please? Thank you.

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:26.604
Now, how do we know about an environment
that's so far away and so different

00:05:26.628 --> 00:05:29.675
and so alien from anything we're used to?

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.175
Well, the Earth -- our environment,
in the form of us --

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.115
is creating knowledge.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.479
Well, what does that mean?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:40.209
Well, look out even further
than we've just been --

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:42.360
I mean from here, with a telescope --

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:46.587
and you'll see things that look
like stars, they're called quasars.

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:49.735
"Quasars" originally meant
"quasi-stellar object,"

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.655
which means "things that look
a bit like stars."

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:54.004
(Laughter)

00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:55.228
But they're not stars.

00:05:55.252 --> 00:05:57.804
And we know what they are.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.829
Billions of years ago
and billions of light-years away,

00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:06.976
the material at the center
of a galaxy collapsed

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.441
towards a supermassive black hole.

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:14.198
And then intense magnetic fields
directed some of the energy

00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:15.692
of that gravitational collapse

00:06:15.716 --> 00:06:16.976
and some of the matter

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.099
back out in the form of tremendous jets,

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:20.957
which illuminated lobes

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:25.402
with the brilliance of --
I think it's a trillion -- suns.

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:32.462
Now, the physics of the human brain
could hardly be more unlike

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:34.410
the physics of such a jet.

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:36.721
We couldn't survive for an instant in it.

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:39.754
Language breaks down
when trying to describe

00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:42.089
what it would be like
in one of those jets.

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:45.113
It would be a bit like experiencing
a supernova explosion,

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:48.755
but at point-blank range
and for millions of years at a time.

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.352
(Laughter)

00:06:52.376 --> 00:06:58.264
And yet, that jet happened
in precisely such a way

00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:02.008
that billions of years later,
on the other side of the universe,

00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:06.174
some bit of chemical scum
could accurately describe

00:07:06.198 --> 00:07:10.188
and model and predict
and explain, above all --

00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:12.448
there's your reference --

00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:15.950
what was happening there, in reality.

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:21.307
The one physical system, the brain,
contains an accurate working model

00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:23.257
of the other, the quasar.

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:26.778
Not just a superficial image of it,
though it contains that as well,

00:07:26.802 --> 00:07:28.783
but an explanatory model,

00:07:28.807 --> 00:07:31.854
embodying the same
mathematical relationships

00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:34.306
and the same causal structure.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.368
Now, that is knowledge.

00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:38.976
And if that weren't amazing enough,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.976
the faithfulness with which
the one structure resembles the other

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.083
is increasing with time.

00:07:45.107 --> 00:07:47.580
That is the growth of knowledge.

00:07:47.604 --> 00:07:51.063
So, the laws of physics
have this special property,

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:55.757
that physical objects as unlike each other
as they could possibly be

00:07:55.781 --> 00:08:01.564
can, nevertheless, embody the same
mathematical and causal structure

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:04.410
and to do it more and more so over time.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.343
So we are a chemical scum
that is different.

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:11.856
This chemical scum has universality.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.335
Its structure contains,
with ever-increasing precision,

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.702
the structure of everything.

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:21.493
This place, and not other places
in the universe,

00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:27.530
is a hub which contains within itself
the structural and causal essence

00:08:27.554 --> 00:08:30.291
of the whole of the rest
of physical reality.

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:32.163
And so, far from being insignificant,

00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:34.958
the fact that the laws
of physics allow this

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:38.483
or even mandate that this can happen

00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:42.482
is one of the most important things
about the physical world.

00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:48.698
Now, how does the solar system --
our environment, in the form of us --

00:08:48.722 --> 00:08:52.048
acquire this special relationship
with the rest of the universe?

00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:56.890
Well, one thing that's true
about Stephen Hawking's remark --

00:08:56.914 --> 00:09:00.940
I mean, it is true,
but it's the wrong emphasis --

00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:06.902
one thing that's true about it is that
it doesn't do it with any special physics,

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.917
there's no special dispensation,
no miracles involved.

00:09:09.941 --> 00:09:14.086
It does it simply with three things
that we have here in abundance.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.721
One of them is matter,

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:20.730
because the growth of knowledge
is a form of information processing.

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:24.691
Information processing is computation,
computation requires a computer,

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:27.714
and there's no known way of making
a computer without matter.

00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:31.213
We also need energy to make
the computer, and most important,

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:35.207
to make the media, in effect,
onto which we record

00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:36.976
the knowledge that we discover.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.141
And then thirdly,
less tangible but just as essential

00:09:41.165 --> 00:09:45.473
for the open-ended creation
of knowledge, of explanations,

00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:48.474
is evidence.

00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:52.323
Now, our environment
is inundated with evidence.

00:09:52.347 --> 00:09:57.976
We happened to get round to testing,
let's say, Newton's law of gravity,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.778
about 300 years ago.

00:09:59.802 --> 00:10:03.092
But the evidence that we used to do that

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:06.405
was falling down on every
square meter of the Earth

00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:08.082
for billions of years before that,

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:11.923
and we'll continue to fall
for billions of years afterwards.

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:15.071
And the same is true
for all the other sciences.

00:10:15.095 --> 00:10:17.029
As far as we know,

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:21.208
evidence to discover the most
fundamental truths of all the sciences

00:10:21.232 --> 00:10:24.274
is here just for the taking,
on our planet.

00:10:24.298 --> 00:10:27.162
Our location is saturated with evidence

00:10:27.186 --> 00:10:29.618
and also with matter and energy.

00:10:29.642 --> 00:10:31.880
Out in intergalactic space,

00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:35.293
those three prerequisites
for the open-ended creation of knowledge

00:10:35.317 --> 00:10:37.737
are at their lowest possible supply --

00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:41.353
as I said, it's empty, it's cold
and it's dark out there.

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:43.678
Or is it?

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.113
Now actually, that's just
another parochial misconception.

00:10:48.137 --> 00:10:49.213
(Laughter)

00:10:49.237 --> 00:10:54.171
Because imagine a cube out there
in intergalactic space,

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.725
the same size as our home,
the solar system.

00:10:57.749 --> 00:11:01.091
Now, that cube is very empty
by human standards,

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:05.976
but that still means that it contains
over a million tons of matter.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.092
And a million tons is enough to make,
say, a self-contained space station,

00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:13.350
on which there's a colony of scientists

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:17.410
that are devoted to creating an open-ended
stream of knowledge, and so on.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:19.999
Now, it's way beyond present technology

00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:24.034
to even gather the hydrogen
from intergalactic space

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:27.236
and form it into other elements and so on.

00:11:27.872 --> 00:11:30.800
But the thing is,
in a comprehensible universe,

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:34.190
if something isn't forbidden
by the laws of physics,

00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:38.359
then what could possibly prevent us
from doing it, other than knowing how?

00:11:38.383 --> 00:11:42.055
In other words, it's a matter
of knowledge, not resources.

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:45.395
If we could do that, we'd automatically
have an energy supply,

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:48.949
because this transmutation
would be a fusion reactor.

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:50.624
And evidence?

00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:53.823
Well, again, it's dark out there
to human senses,

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.966
but all you've got to do
is take a telescope,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.133
even one of present-day design,

00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:02.142
look out, and you'll see
the same galaxies as we do from here.

00:12:02.682 --> 00:12:04.943
And with a more powerful telescope,

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:07.819
you'll be able to see stars
and planets in those galaxies,

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:11.123
you'll be able to do astrophysics
and learn the laws of physics.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.847
And locally there, you could build
particle accelerators

00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:17.143
and learn elementary particle physics
and chemistry, and so on.

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:21.530
Probably the hardest science to do
would be biology field trips --

00:12:21.554 --> 00:12:22.871
(Laughter)

00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:25.914
because it would take
several hundred million years

00:12:25.938 --> 00:12:29.248
to get to the nearest
life-bearing planet and back.

00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:31.483
But I have to tell you --
and sorry, Richard --

00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:34.841
but I never did like biology
field trips much --

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:36.173
(Laughter)

00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:38.193
and I think we can just about make do

00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:40.317
with one every few hundred million years.

00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:42.358
(Laughter)

00:12:42.382 --> 00:12:49.338
So, in fact, intergalactic space
does contain all the prerequisites

00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:51.742
for the open-ended creation of knowledge.

00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:55.426
Any such cube anywhere in the universe

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.035
could become the same kind
of hub that we are,

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:04.909
if the knowledge of how to do so
were present there.

00:13:05.758 --> 00:13:09.232
So, we're not in a uniquely
hospitable place.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.684
If intergalactic space
is capable of creating

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.294
an open-ended stream of explanations,

00:13:14.318 --> 00:13:16.485
then so is almost every other environment,

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:17.739
so is the Earth.

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:20.093
So is a polluted Earth.

00:13:20.521 --> 00:13:24.268
And the limiting factor, there and here,

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:27.066
is not resources --
because they're plentiful --

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.240
but knowledge, which is scarce.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:35.580
Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view
may -- and, I think, ought to --

00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:38.012
make us feel very special.

00:13:38.036 --> 00:13:40.561
But it should also
make us feel vulnerable,

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:44.000
because it means that
without the specific knowledge

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:47.771
that's needed to survive
the ongoing challenges of the universe,

00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:48.976
we won't survive them.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.548
All it takes is for a supernova
to go off a few light-years away,

00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:54.230
and we'll all be dead!

00:13:54.254 --> 00:13:56.653
Martin Rees has recently written a book

00:13:56.677 --> 00:13:59.976
about our vulnerability
to all sorts of things,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.976
from astrophysics, to scientific
experiments gone wrong,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.435
and most importantly, to terrorism
with weapons of mass destruction.

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:11.801
And he thinks that civilization
has only a 50 percent chance

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:13.252
of surviving this century.

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:16.411
I think he's going to talk
about that later in the conference.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:21.583
Now, I don't think that probability
is the right category

00:14:21.607 --> 00:14:22.976
to discuss this issue in,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.735
but I do agree with him about this:

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:28.924
we can survive and we can fail to survive.

00:14:29.565 --> 00:14:32.321
But it depends, not on chance,

00:14:32.345 --> 00:14:35.976
but on whether we create
the relevant knowledge in time.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.802
The danger is not at all unprecedented.

00:14:38.826 --> 00:14:42.047
Species go extinct all the time.

00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:44.326
Civilizations end.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.689
The overwhelming majority
of all species and all civilizations

00:14:47.713 --> 00:14:48.997
that have ever existed

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.298
are now history.

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.196
And if we want to be
the exception to that,

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.119
then logically, our only hope
is to make use of the one feature

00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:03.767
that distinguishes our species
and civilization from all the others,

00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:08.238
namely, our special relationship
with the laws of physics,

00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:12.735
our ability to create
new explanations, new knowledge --

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:15.530
to be a hub of existence.

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:19.639
So let me now apply this
to a current controversy,

00:15:19.663 --> 00:15:22.878
not because I want to advocate
any particular solution,

00:15:22.902 --> 00:15:25.536
but just to illustrate
the kind of thing I mean.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.976
And the controversy is global warming.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.005
Now, I'm a physicist,
but I'm not the right kind of physicist.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:34.816
In regard to global warming,
I'm just a layman.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.618
And the rational thing for a layman to do

00:15:37.642 --> 00:15:42.143
is to take seriously
the prevailing scientific theory.

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:46.834
And according to that theory,
it's already too late to avoid a disaster,

00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:52.688
because, if it's true that our best option
at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions

00:15:52.712 --> 00:15:54.609
with something like the Kyoto Protocol,

00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:58.361
with its constraints on economic activity
and its enormous cost

00:15:58.385 --> 00:16:00.976
of hundreds of billions of dollars,
or whatever it is,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.057
then that is already a disaster
by any reasonable measure.

00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:11.451
And the actions that are advocated are not
even purported to solve the problem,

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:13.855
merely to postpone it by a little.

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:15.664
So it's already too late to avoid it,

00:16:15.688 --> 00:16:18.572
and it probably has been
too late to avoid it

00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:22.417
ever since before anyone
realized the danger.

00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:25.505
It was probably already
too late in the 1970s,

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:28.724
when the best available
scientific theory was telling us

00:16:28.748 --> 00:16:32.364
that industrial emissions were
about to precipitate a new ice age,

00:16:32.388 --> 00:16:34.506
in which billions would die.

00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:37.471
Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me,

00:16:37.495 --> 00:16:41.082
and I don't know why it isn't
informing public debate.

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:44.412
It is that we can't always know.

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:47.129
When we know of an impending disaster

00:16:47.153 --> 00:16:51.696
and how to solve it at a cost less
than the cost of the disaster itself,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.706
then there's not going to be
much argument, really.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.245
But no precautions
and no precautionary principle

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:03.411
can avoid problems
that we do not yet foresee.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:08.498
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,

00:17:08.522 --> 00:17:11.123
not just problem-avoidance.

00:17:11.712 --> 00:17:15.096
And it's true that an ounce of prevention
equals a pound of cure,

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.048
but that's only if we know
what to prevent.

00:17:18.072 --> 00:17:20.033
If you've been punched on the nose,

00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:22.660
then the science of medicine
does not consist of

00:17:22.684 --> 00:17:24.630
teaching you how to avoid punches.

00:17:24.654 --> 00:17:25.670
(Laughter)

00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:31.152
If medical science stopped seeking cures
and concentrated on prevention only,

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.747
then it would achieve
very little of either.

00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:35.796
The world is buzzing at the moment

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.617
with plans to force reductions
in gas emissions at all costs.

00:17:40.998 --> 00:17:45.229
It ought to be buzzing with plans
to reduce the temperature

00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:48.340
and with plans to live
at the higher temperature --

00:17:48.364 --> 00:17:51.508
and not at all costs,
but efficiently and cheaply.

00:17:51.532 --> 00:17:52.859
And some such plans exist,

00:17:52.883 --> 00:17:57.521
things like swarms of mirrors in space
to deflect the sunlight away

00:17:57.545 --> 00:18:01.283
and encouraging aquatic organisms
to eat more carbon dioxide.

00:18:01.307 --> 00:18:04.288
At the moment, these things
are fringe research;

00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:08.064
they're not central to the human effort
to face this problem

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:09.629
or problems in general.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.852
And with problems
that we are not aware of yet,

00:18:12.876 --> 00:18:18.954
the ability to put right -- not the sheer
good luck of avoiding indefinitely --

00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:21.771
is our only hope, not just
of solving problems,

00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:23.229
but of survival.

00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:27.659
So, take two stone tablets

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.179
and carve on them.

00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:33.175
On one of them, carve:

00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.420
"Problems are soluble."

00:18:35.763 --> 00:18:37.888
And on the other one, carve:

00:18:37.912 --> 00:18:39.865
"Problems are inevitable."

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:41.602
Thank you.

00:18:41.626 --> 00:18:42.729
(Applause)
