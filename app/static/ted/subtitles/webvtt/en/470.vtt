WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's talk trash.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know, we had to be taught

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to renounce the powerful conservation ethic

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
toward creation of products for peacetime.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Life Magazine helped in this effort

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
by announcing the introduction of throwaways

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mental note to the liberators:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Plastics are also hard to recycle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of plastics recovered in our waste stream.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's diddly-point-squat.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's the percentage we recycle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and does not drive off the oily contaminants

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
for which it is a sponge.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
will be made into fast-track trash.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
A large, unruly fraction of our trash

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
will flow downriver to the sea.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In spite of deposit fees,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Here is a remote island repository for bottles

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
off the coast of Baja California.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
from a different plastic, polypropylene.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They will float in seawater,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that make it to sea solo.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
while ours get caught in the California current

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
while ours litter the Philippines.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
of the North Pacific Gyre.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It so happens that millions of albatross

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
nesting on Kure and Midway atolls

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
forage here and scavenge whatever they can find

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
for regurgitation to their chicks.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
died with this in its stomach.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
like cigarette lighters ...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but, mostly bottle caps.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
tossing about in the ocean surface.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The retainer rings for the caps

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
also have consequences for aquatic animals.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
This is Mae West,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I got plenty of takers.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I separated them by color

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and put them on display the next Earth Day

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
they shook my hand. (Laughter)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
from the gyre north of Hawaii

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with more plastic than plankton.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
produces samples like this.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And this.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it looks like this.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that contain more plastic than plankton?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
at the base of the food chain,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
was ingesting these poison pills.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We did hundreds of necropsies,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But no fishmonger on Earth

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The throwaway society cannot be contained --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it has gone global.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We have to throw it away.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now, the market can do a lot for us,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the amount of packaging is increasing,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and it's showing up in the ocean.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Straining the ocean for plastic

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
would be beyond the budget of any country

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in Long Beach, California.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Charles Moore: Thank you.
