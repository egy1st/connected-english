WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.277
This is the first of two
rather extraordinary photographs

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:04.651
I'm going to show you today.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:06.253
It was taken 18 years ago.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:07.778
I was 19 years old at the time.

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:08.953
I had just returned

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.763
from one of the deepest dives
I'd ever made at that time --

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:12.945
a little over 200 feet.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.914
And I had caught this little fish.

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:17.708
It turns out that particular one
was the first of its kind

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:18.886
ever taken alive.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.584
I'm not just an ichthyologist,
I'm a bona fide fish nerd.

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:24.305
And to a fish nerd,
this is some pretty exciting stuff.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.250
More exciting was the fact
that the person who took this photo

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:28.610
is a guy named Jack Randall,

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.417
the greatest living
ichthyologist on earth --

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.981
the Grand Poobah
of fish nerds, if you will.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.907
And so, it was really exciting
to me to have this moment in time.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.031
It set the course for the rest of my life.

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:44.502
But really, the most significant,
most profound thing about this picture

00:00:44.526 --> 00:00:47.265
is it was taken two days
before I was completely paralyzed

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.451
from the neck down.

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:50.824
I made a really stupid kind of mistake

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:53.888
that most 19-year-old males do
when they think they're immortal,

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:56.483
and I got a bad case of the bends
and was paralyzed,

00:00:56.507 --> 00:00:58.578
and had to be flown back for treatment.

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.606
I learned two really
important things that day.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.020
The first thing I learned -- well,
I'm mortal. That's a really big one.

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:09.493
And the second thing I learned
was that I knew, with profound certainty,

00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:12.757
that this is exactly what I was going
to do for the rest of my life.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.409
I had to focus all my energies

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.552
towards going to find
new species of things

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.324
down on deep coral reefs.

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:22.465
When you think of a coral reef,
this is what most people think of:

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:24.259
these big, hard, elaborate corals,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.302
lots of bright, colorful
fishes and things.

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:28.532
But this is really
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:30.647
If you look at this diagram
of a coral reef,

00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:32.821
we know a lot about that part
up near the top.

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:35.176
The reason we know so much about it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040
is scuba divers can very easily
go down there and access it.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.176
There is a problem with scuba, though,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.968
in that it imposes some limitations
on how deep you can go.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:45.007
It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.348
I'll get into why that is
in just a minute,

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.898
but the point is, scuba divers
generally stay less than 100 feet deep,

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:54.446
and very rarely go much below this,
at least, not with any kind of sanity.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.002
So to go deeper, most biologists
have turned to submersibles.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:00.176
Now, submersibles are great,
wonderful things,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.855
but if you're going to spend 30,000
dollars a day to use one of these things

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.673
and it's capable of going 2,000 feet,

00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:09.176
you're not going to go farting around
up here in a couple of hundred feet,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.974
you're going to go way down deep.

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:13.867
So the bottom line is, almost
all research using submersibles

00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:15.631
has taken place well below 500 feet.

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:17.477
Now, it's pretty obvious at this point

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.129
there's a zone here in the middle.

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:20.424
That's the zone

00:02:20.448 --> 00:02:23.154
that centers around my own
personal pursuit of happiness.

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:26.576
I want to find out what's in this zone;
we know almost nothing about it.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.577
Scuba divers can't get there,
submarines go right on past it.

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.148
It took me a year to learn to walk again
after my diving accident in Palau.

00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:34.323
During that year,

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:37.786
I spent a lot of time learning
about the physics and physiology of diving

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.623
and how to overcome these limitations.

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:41.569
I'm just going to show you a basic idea.

00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:43.224
We're all breathing air right now.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:45.160
Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:47.263
20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.

00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:48.437
It's in our lungs.

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.525
And there's a phenomenon
called Henry's law,

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.555
that says gases will dissolve into a fluid

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.553
in proportion to the partial pressures
you're exposing them to.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.736
So, basically the gas
dissolves into our body.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.388
The oxygen is bound by metabolism,
we use it for energy.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:03.233
The nitrogen sort of floats around
in our blood and tissues.

00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:05.176
That's fine, it's how we're designed.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.211
The problem happens
when you go underwater.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.038
The deeper you go underwater,
the higher the pressure is.

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:12.603
If you were to go down
to a depth of about 130 feet,

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:15.152
which is the recommended
limit for most scuba divers,

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:16.674
you'd get this pressure effect.

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:20.381
The effect of that pressure is you have
an increased density of gas molecules

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.621
in every breath you take.

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:25.484
Over time, those gas molecules
dissolve into your blood and tissues

00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:26.921
and start to fill you up.

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.588
Now, if you were to go
down to, say, 300 feet,

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:32.550
you don't have five times as many
gas molecules in your lungs,

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:35.202
you've got 10 times as many
gas molecules in your lungs.

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:38.507
And, sure enough, they dissolve
into your blood and tissues as well.

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.612
And if you were to go down to where
there's 15 times as much --

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:44.645
the deeper you go, the more
exacerbating the problem becomes.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:49.158
The limitation of diving with air
is all those dots in your body,

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:50.951
all the nitrogen and all the oxygen.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:53.675
There are three basic
limitations of scuba diving.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.534
The first limitation is the oxygen --

00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:56.885
oxygen toxicity.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.163
Now, we all know the song:
"Love is like oxygen.

00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:02.482
You get too much, you get too high.
Not enough, and you're gonna die."

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:05.494
Well, in the context of diving,
you get too much, you die also.

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:08.518
You die because oxygen
toxicity can cause a seizure.

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:12.090
It makes you convulse underwater --
not a good thing to happen underwater.

00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:15.621
It happens because there's too much
concentration of oxygen in your body.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.287
The nitrogen has two problems.

00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:21.684
One of them is what Jacques Cousteau
called "rapture of the deep."

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:23.050
It's nitrogen narcosis.

00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:25.861
It makes you loopy; the deeper
you go, the loopier you get.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:28.754
You don't want to drive drunk,
you don't want to dive drunk.

00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:30.176
So that's a real big problem.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.743
And of course, the third problem

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.910
is the one I found out
the hard way in Palau,

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:35.092
which is the bends.

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:36.507
One thing I forgot to mention

00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:39.064
is that to obviate the problem
of nitrogen narcosis --

00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:40.874
all of those blue dots in our body --

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:43.298
you remove the nitrogen
and replace it with helium.

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:46.155
Helium's a gas; there're a lot
of reasons why helium's good,

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:49.166
it's a tiny molecule, it's inert,
it doesn't give you narcosis.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.892
So that's the basic concept we use.

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.495
But the theory's relatively easy.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.352
The tricky part is the implementation.

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:56.485
So this is how I began about 15 years ago.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.215
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly
the smartest of starts,

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:00.905
but you've got to start somewhere.

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:01.937
(Laughter)

00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:05.159
At the time, I wasn't the only one
who didn't know what I was doing.

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:06.342
Almost nobody did.

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:08.706
This rig was actually used
for a dive of 300 feet.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.365
But over time we got better at it,

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.081
and we came up with this really
sophisticated-looking rig

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:16.412
with four scuba tanks, five regulators
and all the right gas mixtures,

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:17.587
all that good stuff.

00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:20.888
It was fine and dandy, it allowed us
to go down and find new species.

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:23.964
This picture was taken at 300 feet,
catching new species of fish.

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:26.091
The problem was
it didn't allow us much time.

00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:29.317
For all its bulk and size, it only gave us
about 15 minutes at most

00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:30.853
down at those sorts of depths.

00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:33.214
We needed more time.
There had to be a better way.

00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:34.912
And indeed, there is a better way.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:37.096
In 1994, I was fortunate
enough to get access

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.720
to these prototype
closed-circuit rebreathers.

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:43.544
Closed-circuit rebreather:
what makes it different from scuba,

00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:44.729
and why is it better?

00:05:44.753 --> 00:05:47.604
Well, there are three main
advantages to a rebreather.

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:49.788
One, they're quiet,
they don't make any noise.

00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:51.977
Two, they allow you to stay
underwater longer.

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:53.874
Three, they allow you to go deeper.

00:05:53.898 --> 00:05:55.255
How is it that they do that?

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.486
In order to really understand
how they do that,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.399
you have to look underneath the hood
and see what's going on.

00:06:00.423 --> 00:06:03.294
There are three basic systems
to a closed-circuit rebreather.

00:06:03.318 --> 00:06:05.906
The most fundamental
is called the breathing loop.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.372
It's a breathing loop
because you breathe off of it;

00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:11.553
it's a closed loop, and you breathe
the same gas around and around.

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:13.921
There's a mouthpiece
that you put in your mouth,

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:16.970
and there's a counter lung,
or in this case, two counter lungs.

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:20.058
The counter lungs aren't high tech,
they're simply flexible bags.

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:23.059
They allow you to mechanically
breathe, mechanically ventilate.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.534
When you exhale, it goes
in the exhale counter lung;

00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:28.143
when you inhale, it comes
from the inhale counter lung.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:31.952
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you
to cycle air through this breathing loop.

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:36.180
The other component on a breathing loop
is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:39.076
Now, as we breathe,
we produce carbon dioxide,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.101
and that carbon dioxide needs
to be scrubbed out of the system.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:43.773
There's a chemical filter in there

00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:46.378
that pulls the carbon dioxide
out of the breathing gas,

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:49.790
so that when it comes back to us,
it's safe to breathe again.

00:06:49.814 --> 00:06:52.032
That's the breathing loop in a nutshell.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:55.000
The second main component
of a closed-circuit rebreather

00:06:55.024 --> 00:06:56.366
is the gas system.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.840
The primary purpose of the gas system
is to provide oxygen,

00:06:59.864 --> 00:07:02.480
to replenish the oxygen
that your body consumes.

00:07:02.504 --> 00:07:04.595
So the main tank, the main critical thing,

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:07.460
is this oxygen gas
supply cylinder we have here.

00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:09.841
But if we only had
an oxygen gas supply cylinder,

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:11.581
we wouldn't be able to go very deep,

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:14.030
because we'd run into
oxygen toxicity very quickly.

00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:17.176
So we need another gas,
something to dilute the oxygen with.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.462
And that, fittingly enough,
is called the diluent gas supply.

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:24.922
In our applications, we generally
put air inside this diluent gas supply,

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:27.646
because it's a very cheap
and easy source of nitrogen.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.647
So that's where we get our nitrogen from.

00:07:29.671 --> 00:07:33.140
But if we want to go deeper,
of course, we need another gas supply,

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:35.275
and helium is what
we really need to go deep.

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:37.447
Usually we'll have
a slightly larger cylinder,

00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:39.638
mounted exterior
on the rebreather, like this.

00:07:39.662 --> 00:07:42.685
That's what we use to inject,
as we start to do our deep dives.

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:45.875
We also have a second oxygen cylinder,
solely as a backup;

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.238
if there's a problem
with our first oxygen supply,

00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:49.571
we can continue to breathe.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:53.056
The way you manage all these different
gases and different gas supplies

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.471
is this really high-tech, sophisticated
gas block up on the front here,

00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:57.703
where it's easy to reach.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.019
It's got the valves and knobs
and things you need

00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:02.102
to inject the right gases
at the right time.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:03.845
Normally, you don't have to do that,

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:05.682
because all of it's done automatically

00:08:05.706 --> 00:08:08.334
with the electronics,
the third system of a rebreather.

00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:11.283
The most critical part of a rebreather
are the oxygen sensors.

00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:14.173
You need three, so if one goes bad,
you know which one it is.

00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:15.351
You need voting logic.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.280
You also have three microprocessors.

00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:19.784
Any one of those computers
can run the entire system,

00:08:19.808 --> 00:08:21.486
so if you have to lose two of them,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.002
there's back-up power supplies.

00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:26.299
And there are multiple displays,
to get the information to the diver.

00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:29.815
This is the high-tech gadgetry
that allows us to do what we do

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.073
on these deep dives.

00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:33.504
I can talk about it all day --
just ask my wife --

00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:36.207
but I want to move on
to something much more interesting.

00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.997
I'm going to take you on a deep dive,

00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:39.832
and show you what it's like to do one.

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:41.007
We start up on the boat,

00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:43.136
For all this high-tech,
expensive equipment,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.369
this is still the best way
to get in the water,

00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:47.132
just flop over the side of the boat.

00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:49.383
Now, as I showed you
in the earlier diagram,

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:52.772
these reefs that we dive on
start out near the surface

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:55.444
and they go almost vertically,
completely straight down.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.349
So we drop in the water
and go over the edge of this cliff,

00:08:58.373 --> 00:09:00.587
and then we start dropping,
dropping, dropping.

00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:02.921
People ask if it takes
a long time to get there.

00:09:02.945 --> 00:09:06.638
No; it only takes a couple minutes
to get down to three or four hundred feet,

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:08.154
which is what we're aiming for.

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:11.244
It's like skydiving in slow motion.
It's really very interesting.

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:12.556
You ever see "The Abyss,"

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.366
where Ed Harris is sinking down
along the side of the wall?

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.113
That's what it feels like. Amazing.

00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:20.534
And down there, you find that the water
is very clear, extremely clear,

00:09:20.558 --> 00:09:22.281
because there's hardly any plankton.

00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:24.842
When you turn on your light
and look around the caves,

00:09:24.866 --> 00:09:27.499
you're confronted with a tremendous
amount of diversity,

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:29.336
much more than anyone used to believe.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.094
Now, not all of it is new species --

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:34.819
that fish you see with the white stripe,
that's a known species.

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:38.169
But if you look carefully
into the cracks and crevices,

00:09:38.193 --> 00:09:41.273
you'll see little things
scurrying all over the place.

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:43.760
There's a just unbelievable diversity.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.110
It's not just fish, either.

00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:48.612
These are crinoids, sponges, black corals.
There're some more fishes.

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:50.898
Those fishes that you see now
are new species.

00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:52.272
They're still new species,

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.518
because I had a video camera
instead of my net,

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:57.585
so they're still waiting down there
for someone to go find them.

00:09:57.609 --> 00:09:59.129
But this is what it looks like.

00:09:59.153 --> 00:10:02.287
And this kind of habitat just goes
on and on and on for miles.

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.245
This is Papua, New Guinea.

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:08.804
Now little fishes and invertebrates
aren't the only things we see down there.

00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:10.102
We also see sharks,

00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:12.507
much more regularly
than I would have expected to.

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:13.732
We're not quite sure why.

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:16.865
What I want you to do now
is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:18.897
with all this high-tech gear on your back,

00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:21.069
you're in a remote reef
off Papua, New Guinea,

00:10:21.093 --> 00:10:23.854
thousands of miles from the nearest
recompression chamber,

00:10:23.878 --> 00:10:26.289
and you're completely
surrounded by sharks.

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:28.798
(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice)
Look at those ...

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:29.985
Diver 2: Uh, oh ...

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:31.160
Uh, oh!

00:10:31.184 --> 00:10:32.398
Audience: (Laughter)

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:34.947
(Video) Diver 1: I think we have
their attention ...

00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:37.501
Richard Pyle: When you start
talking like Donald Duck,

00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:40.098
there's no situation in the world
that can seem tense.

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:42.056
(Laughter)

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.994
So we're down there --
this is at 400 feet.

00:10:45.018 --> 00:10:48.892
That's looking straight up, by the way,
to give a sense of how far the surface is.

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:51.164
And if you're a biologist
and know about sharks,

00:10:51.188 --> 00:10:54.438
and you want to assess,
how much jeopardy am I really in here,

00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:58.564
there's one question that sort of jumps
to the forefront of your mind immediately,

00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:01.530
which is --

00:11:01.554 --> 00:11:04.006
(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.792
Diver 2: Silvertip sharks.

00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:06.982
Diver 1: Oh.

00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:09.503
RP: There are actually
three species of sharks here.

00:11:09.527 --> 00:11:12.415
The silvertips are the ones
with the white edges on the fins,

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:15.923
and there're also gray reef sharks
and hammerheads off in the distance.

00:11:15.947 --> 00:11:17.884
And yes, it's a little nerve-racking.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.200
(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!

00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:24.361
That little guy is frisky!

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:26.011
Audience: (Laughter)

00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:32.157
Now, you've seen video like this on TV
a lot, and it's very intimidating.

00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:34.574
I think it gives the wrong
impression about sharks;

00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:36.684
they're actually not
very dangerous animals.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.442
That's why we weren't worried much
and were joking around.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:42.143
More people are killed
by pigs, by lightning strikes,

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:44.502
more people are killed
at soccer games in England.

00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:46.573
There's a lot of other ways you can die.

00:11:46.597 --> 00:11:48.371
And I'm not making that stuff up.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:52.097
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut
more likely than killed by a shark.

00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:56.098
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous
as most people make them out to be.

00:11:56.122 --> 00:11:59.177
Now, I don't know if any of you get
US News and World Report --

00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:00.399
I got the recent issue.

00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:03.240
There's a cover story
about the great explorers of our time.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.964
The last article is entitled,
"No New Frontiers."

00:12:06.988 --> 00:12:10.433
It questions whether or not there
really are any new frontiers out there,

00:12:10.457 --> 00:12:13.861
whether there are any true, hardcore
discoveries that can still be made.

00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:15.510
My favorite line from the article:

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:19.403
[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy
with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."]

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:22.194
I have to laugh; they don't call us
fish nerds for nothing.

00:12:22.218 --> 00:12:25.558
We actually do get excited about finding
a new dorsal spine in a guppy.

00:12:25.582 --> 00:12:26.979
But it's much more than that.

00:12:27.003 --> 00:12:30.579
I want to show you a few of the guppies
we've found over the years.

00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:32.729
This one -- you can see how ugly it is.

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:33.778
(Laughter)

00:12:33.802 --> 00:12:36.851
Even if you ignore
the scientific value of this thing,

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:38.852
look at the monetary value of this thing.

00:12:38.876 --> 00:12:41.929
A couple of these were sold
through the aquarium trade to Japan,

00:12:41.953 --> 00:12:44.066
where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.722
That's half a million dollars a pound.

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:49.348
Here's another new angelfish
we discovered.

00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:52.858
This one we first discovered back
in the air days -- the bad old air days,

00:12:52.882 --> 00:12:55.271
when we were doing
these kind of dives with air.

00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:56.453
We were at 360 feet.

00:12:56.477 --> 00:12:59.735
I remember coming up from one
of these deep dives and I had this fog,

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:03.996
and the narcosis takes a little while
to fade away, sort of like sobering up.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.726
I had this vague recollection of seeing
this yellow fish with a black spot,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.097
and thought, "Damn,
I should have caught one --

00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:11.563
I think that's a new species."

00:13:11.587 --> 00:13:13.214
Eventually, I looked in my bucket.

00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:16.219
Sure enough, I had caught one,
I just completely forgot.

00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:20.097
So this one, we decided to give
the name Centropyge narcosis to.

00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:22.084
That's its official scientific name,

00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:24.070
in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.287
This is another neat one.

00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:26.470
When we first found it,

00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:28.753
we weren't even sure
what family it belonged to,

00:13:28.777 --> 00:13:30.690
so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,

00:13:30.714 --> 00:13:33.292
since it looked like something
from one of those books.

00:13:33.316 --> 00:13:34.666
Now, this one's pretty cool.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.132
If you go to Papua, New Guinea
and go down 300 feet,

00:13:37.156 --> 00:13:38.512
you'll see these big mounds.

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:41.783
This may be hard to see,
but they're a couple meters in diameter.

00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:45.144
If you look closely, you'll see
there's a little white and gray fish

00:13:45.168 --> 00:13:46.375
that hangs out near them.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:49.410
It turns out this little white fish
builds these giant mounds,

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:50.958
one pebble at a time.

00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:53.176
It's extraordinary
to find something like this.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.971
It's not just new species,
it's new behaviors, new ecology,

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.146
all kind of new things.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.095
What I'm going to show you now, quickly,

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:01.516
is a sampling of the new species
we've discovered.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.897
What's extraordinary is not just
the number of species we're finding --

00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:07.067
though as you can see,
that's pretty amazing;

00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:09.004
this is only half of what we've found --

00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:11.924
what's extraordinary
is how quickly we find them.

00:14:11.948 --> 00:14:15.283
We're up to seven new species per hour
of time we spend at that depth.

00:14:15.307 --> 00:14:19.627
If you go to an Amazon jungle and fog
a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.748
but for fishes,
there's nowhere in the world

00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:24.629
you can get seven new species
per hour of time.

00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:27.240
Now, we've done some
back-of-the-envelope calculations,

00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:30.688
and we're predicting there are probably
about 2,000 to 2,500 new species

00:14:30.712 --> 00:14:32.061
in the Indo-Pacific alone.

00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:34.739
There are only five
to six thousand known species,

00:14:34.763 --> 00:14:38.335
so a very large percentage
of what is out there isn't really known.

00:14:38.359 --> 00:14:41.939
We thought we had a handle on all the reef
fish diversity -- evidently not.

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:44.185
I'm going to just close
on a very somber note.

00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:48.169
At the beginning, I said I'd show you
two extraordinary photographs.

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:51.352
This is the second extraordinary
photograph I'm going to show you.

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:55.564
This one was taken at the exact moment
I was down there filming those sharks.

00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:57.912
This was taken exactly
300 feet above my head.

00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:01.176
The reason this photograph
is extraordinary

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.718
is because it captures a moment

00:15:02.742 --> 00:15:05.176
in the very last minute
of a person's life.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.769
Less than 60 seconds after this picture
was taken, this guy was dead.

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:12.781
When we recovered his body,
we figured out what had gone wrong.

00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:14.445
He had made a very simple mistake;

00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:17.001
he turned the wrong valve
when he filled his cylinder.

00:15:17.025 --> 00:15:20.030
he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank
when he should have had 40.

00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:22.710
He had an oxygen toxicity
seizure and he drowned.

00:15:22.734 --> 00:15:25.658
The reason I show this --
not to put a downer on everything --

00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:29.571
but I just want to use it to key off
my philosophy of life in general,

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.333
which is that we all have two goals.

00:15:31.357 --> 00:15:34.601
The first goal we share with every other
living thing on this planet,

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:35.785
which is to survive.

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:39.689
I call it perpetuation: the survival
of the species and survival of ourselves,

00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:42.179
And those are both
about perpetuating the genome.

00:15:42.203 --> 00:15:45.447
The second goal, for those of us
who have mastered the first goal --

00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:49.850
call it spiritual fulfillment,
call it financial success,

00:15:49.874 --> 00:15:52.201
you can call it any number
of different things.

00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:54.910
I call it seeking joy,
this pursuit of happiness.

00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:58.573
So, I guess my theme on this
is this guy lived his life to the fullest,

00:15:58.597 --> 00:15:59.767
he absolutely did.

00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:01.577
You have to balance those two goals.

00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:03.468
If you live your whole life in fear --

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:08.041
I mean, life is a sexually transmitted
disease with 100 percent mortality.

00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:10.225
So you can't live your life in fear.

00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:12.469
(Laughter)

00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:14.737
I thought that was an old one!

00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:15.812
(Applause)

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:19.977
But at the same time, you don't want
to get so focused on rule number two,

00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:21.453
goal number two,

00:16:21.477 --> 00:16:23.176
that you neglect goal number one.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.445
Because once you're dead, you really can't
enjoy anything after that.

00:16:26.469 --> 00:16:29.445
So I wish you all the best of luck
in maintaining that balance

00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:30.661
in your future endeavors.

00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:31.835
Thanks.
