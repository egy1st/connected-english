00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was raised in Seoul, Korea,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was pre-med at the time,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I thought I would become a surgeon

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because I was interested in anatomy

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a living organism.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I wanted to dissect it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and look into its unseen layers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And the way to it, for me,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
was through artistic means.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and in grad school I became interested

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But I took a liking to them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because they dwell on the fringes of society.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they're also considered pests.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I also started looking around in the city

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and trying to photograph them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
hoping to catch a rat or two,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and a man came up to me and said,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
"You can't take photographs here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The MTA will confiscate your camera."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was quite shocked by that,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll follow the rats."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then I started going into the tunnels,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
guerrilla historians, etc.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of people who regularly explore urban ruins

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
such as abandoned subway stations,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
When I took photographs in these locations,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I felt there was something missing in the pictures.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
wasn't enough for me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So I wanted to create a fictional character

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and the simplest way to do it, at the time,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
was to model myself.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I decided against clothing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
or time-specific elements.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's now an empty, six-acre lot

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was very fond of this space

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that is abandoned.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
When I first went in, I was scared,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But they happened to be wild dogs living there,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and it was right by the water,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so there were swans and ducks swimming around

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and trees growing everywhere

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to become a part of that nature.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
When I got comfortable in the space,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it also felt like a big playground.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
as if I went back in time and became a child again.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The construction began in 1837.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It lasted about five years.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
When you go into spaces like this,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you're directly accessing the past,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because they sit untouched for decades.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and shimmying up and down narrow cracks

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and getting wet and muddy

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The murals were done by a graffiti artist

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
when the tunnel reopened for trains.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There's nobody around you,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
completely unaware of what's underneath.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
When I was going out a lot to these places,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because I was in a solitary phase in my life,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which references Charles Baudelaire.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is the same tunnel.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and the train approaching.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
This is a tunnel that's abandoned in Hell's Kitchen.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I was there alone, setting up,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and a homeless man approached.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I was basically intruding in his living space.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I was really frightened at first,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and he didn't seem to mind

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and ran back and forth.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to wipe off my feet

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and kindly walked me out.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It must have been a very unusual day for him.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Laughter)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
One thing that struck me, after this incident,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
That homeless man, to me, really represented

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
an element of the unconscious of the city.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
He told me that he was abused above ground

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and was once in Riker's Island,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The tunnels are famous for having been used

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
during the development of the Manhattan Project.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
This particular tunnel is interesting

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which was demolished in 1890

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
when Columbia moved in.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
This is the New York City Farm Colony,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
which was a poorhouse in Staten Island

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
from the 1890s to the 1930s.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Most of my photos are set in places

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that have been abandoned for decades,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but this is an exception.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
This children's hospital was closed in 1997;

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it's located in Newark.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
When I was there three years ago,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but everything was left there as it was.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and even used utensils,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
which you see on the autopsy table.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
any man-made structures around you.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and how vulnerable people truly are.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I love to travel,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's full of history,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and also full of underground bunkers

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and ruins from the war.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This was taken under a homeless asylum

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I saw the structure while I was on the train,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I got off at the next station and met people there

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
which was used for ammunition storage during the war

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I explored there extensively

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in the off-limits areas

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and fell in love right away.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and by the 18th century,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and dug new observation tunnels

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
in order to monitor and map the whole place.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And at the same time,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
making them into the catacombs.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The remains of over six million people are housed in there,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
some over 1,300 years old.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
where most of the ossuaries are located.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and many bunkers from the World War II era.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This is a German bunker.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Nearby there's a French bunker,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and the whole tunnel system is so complex

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that the two parties never met.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
After exploring the underground of Paris,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I decided to climb up,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and I climbed a Gothic monument

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that's right in the middle of Paris.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It was built in the early 1500s.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter)

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And all this time,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I never saw a single rat in any of these places,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
until recently, when I was in the London sewers.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This was probably the toughest place to explore.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I guess, except for in this picture.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And when the tides of waste matter come in

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And this is the first theater project I worked on.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It was performed last September one time only

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
built in 1844.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The last place I visited

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I like doing more than just exploring these spaces.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in order to preserve their memories in a creative way --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
before they're lost forever.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Thank you.
