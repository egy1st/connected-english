00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Four years ago, on the TED stage,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.398
I announced a company I was working with at the time

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:07.307
called Odeo.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.984
And because of that announcement,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.046
we got a big article in The New York Times,

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.323
which led to more press, which led to more attention,

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:17.000
and me deciding to become CEO of that company --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
whereas I was just an adviser --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.353
and raising a round of venture capital

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.000
and ramping up hiring.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.846
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.784
and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:35.446
Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:39.000
that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.246
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:43.092
so we kind of put two and two together,

00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:48.045
and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:50.523
Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.876
at a startup, where focus is so critical,

00:00:52.876 --> 00:00:55.215
but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:56.538
to my previous company,

00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:59.000
thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600
and it ended up taking over not only the company,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.000
but my life for the next five or six years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.337
So I learned to follow hunches

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:08.200
even though you can't necessarily justify them

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.629
or know where they're going to go.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:13.000
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So, for those of you unfamiliar,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.461
Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:21.676
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:25.000
and people who are interested in you get those updates.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.446
If they're really interested,

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:29.584
they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:32.000
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.044
that I'm giving a talk at TED.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:36.784
And in my case, when I hit send,

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:41.050
up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.422
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter

00:01:44.422 --> 00:01:46.861
lets people share moments of their lives

00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.076
whenever they want,

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:50.384
be they momentous occasions

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:53.922
or mundane ones.

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:56.752
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening

00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:00.526
that lets people feel more connected and in touch,

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.706
despite distance, and in real time.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:05.678
This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,

00:02:05.678 --> 00:02:08.037
and what got us excited.

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:11.522
What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:14.603
that would evolve from this very simple system.

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:16.600
One of the things we realized

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.882
was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:23.179
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.090
in October of 2007,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.295
people turned to Twitter to report what was happening

00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:29.329
and to find information from neighbors

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.101
about what was happening around them.

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:32.406
But it wasn't just individuals.

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:35.989
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.006
and put a Twitter feed on the front page,

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.094
and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:43.190
used it to dispense news and updates as well.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.253
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.916
and thousands of people around the world are following along

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:50.898
because they want to know what it feels like to be here

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:52.474
and what's happening.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:55.554
Among the other interesting things that have cropped up

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:57.603
are many things from businesses,

00:02:57.603 --> 00:03:00.245
from marketing and communications and predictable things,

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:03.482
to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.738
that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:10.754
causing a line to form around the block.

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:13.800
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.890
In fact, there are 47 members of Congress

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.641
who currently have Twitter accounts.

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.071
And they're tweeting, in some cases,

00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:22.545
from behind closed-door sessions with the President.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.143
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:28.666
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:32.553
although his tweets have dropped off as of late,

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:37.344
while Senator McCain's have picked up.

00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:40.528
As have this guy's.

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:44.393
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:

00:03:44.393 --> 00:03:46.425
you send one message and it goes out to everybody,

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.481
and you receive the messages you're interested in.

00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:52.801
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:56.482
was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person

00:03:56.482 --> 00:03:58.788
or a specific message.

00:03:58.788 --> 00:04:01.957
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here

00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:03.661
to reply to one of his fans,

00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:05.501
was completely invented by users,

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:08.534
and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:10.501
and then we made it easier.

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.332
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.

00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:15.101
Another is via the API.

00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.005
We built an application-programming interface,

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:21.322
which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:24.005
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:25.357
that can send Twitter updates --

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:29.845
interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:32.237
as well as things like

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.637
a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks

00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:37.740
or a plant Twitter when it needs water.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.365
Probably the most important third-party development

00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:43.125
came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.396
Summize built a Twitter search engine.

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:47.206
And they tapped into the fact

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.413
that, if you have millions of people around the world

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:51.821
talking about what they're doing and what's around them,

00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.648
you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event

00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:58.293
while it's going on.

00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:00.633
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.813
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.

00:05:04.813 --> 00:05:08.102
This is another way that our mind was shifted,

00:05:08.102 --> 00:05:10.462
and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.

00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:12.879
We liked this so much we actually bought the company

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.310
and are folding it into the main product.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.694
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,

00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.134
but it introduces new use cases as well.

00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:23.846
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago

00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:26.393
when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.133
Some users figured out

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.146
that they would Twitter when they found gas --

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:33.422
where it was, and how much it cost --

00:05:33.422 --> 00:05:35.936
and then appended the keyword "#atlgas"

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:39.614
which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.

00:05:39.614 --> 00:05:41.943
And this trend of people using this communication network

00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:43.319
to help each other out

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.162
goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.

00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:50.329
It's happened more and more lately,

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.815
whether it's raising money for homeless people

00:05:52.815 --> 00:05:54.551
or to dig wells in Africa

00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:56.815
or for a family in crisis.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.639
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.091
in a matter of days on several occasions.

00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:09.168
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.736
more good things happen.

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:15.968
I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:18.032
I've learned to follow the hunch,

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:21.176
but never assume where it will go.

00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:23.360
Thanks.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.245
(Applause)

00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:31.016
Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.354
So, look, if we could have this screen live.

00:06:33.354 --> 00:06:35.722
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do

00:06:35.722 --> 00:06:37.384
after they've been to an event.

00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:40.360
It's totally intimidating.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.480
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.215
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.

00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:52.615
For example: "Evan Williams."

00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:56.923
"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."

00:06:56.923 --> 00:07:00.000
"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --"

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.814
Oh.

00:07:00.814 --> 00:07:02.722
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.860
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter)

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.414
Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.

00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:09.784
CA: Just kidding.

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:12.538
But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,

00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:14.891
there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:17.492
So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:

00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:19.752
the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,

00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:21.137
the fact that it came out of TED.

00:07:21.137 --> 00:07:24.091
I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.

00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:26.368
You have build something very fascinating,

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:28.691
and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.399
So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:37.000
CA: That was very interesting.
