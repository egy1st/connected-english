00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Back in 1992, I started working for a company

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
called Interval Research,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was just then being founded

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by David Lidell and Paul Allen

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I met with David

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to talk about what I might do in his company.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and writing books --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after twenty years or so in the computer game industry

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
having ideas that people didn't think they could sell.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And David and I discovered

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we had a question in common,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that we really wanted the answer to,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and that was,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Why is that?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
These people aren't that smart.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There's six billion dollars on the table.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They would go for it if they could figure out how.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, what is the deal here?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And as we thought about our goals --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in the classical sense

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that humanism, at its best,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with a set of core values

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that fundamentally love and respect people.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The basic idea of humanism

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is the improvable quality of life;

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we can do good things,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that there are things worth doing

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because they're good things to do,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and that clear-eyed empiricism

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
can help us figure out how to do them.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So, contrary to popular belief,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And Interval Research is kind of the living example

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of how that can be true.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So David and I decided to go find out,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
through the best research we could muster,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
what it would take to get a little girl

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to put her hands on a computer,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that little boys have because they play video games.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We spent two and a half years conducting research;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we spent another year and a half in advance development.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then we formed a spin-off company.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In the research phase of the project at Interval,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
changed my mind entirely about what market research was

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and what it could be.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They taught me how to look and see,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of saying to a child,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
"Of all these things we already make you,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
which do you like best?" --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
which gives you zero answers that are usable.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, what we did for the first two and a half years

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was four things:

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We did an extensive review of the literature

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in related fields, like cognitive psychology,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
spatial cognition, gender studies,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
play theory, sociology, primatology.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I love you and I'd give anything to meet you.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and discovered what we thought the salient issues were

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
with girls and boys and playing --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because, after all, that's really what this is about --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we moved to the second phase of our work,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
where we interviewed adult experts

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in academia, some of the people

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
like playground supervisors. We talked to them,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about gender difference and play.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
ages seven to 12, all over the United States --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and they wouldn't be a representative sample.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And at the end of those remarkable conversations

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
with kids and their best friends across the United States,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000
drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
for designing computer-based products --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and testing them with little girls.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which was a spinoff of Interval Research,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We launched a website on September 2nd

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that has now served 25 million pages,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and has 42,000 registered young girl users.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They visit an average of one and a half times a day,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
spend an average of 35 minutes a visit,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and look at 50 pages a visit.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We launched two titles in October --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
"Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Who are my friends?";

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to exercise the love of social complexity

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
entertainment titles in PC Data

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
in December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
which thrills me to death.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So, we're real,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We've made half-a-billion impressions

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
four percent of them have been "other."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I want to talk about the other,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
because the politics of this enterprise, in a way,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
have been the most fascinating part of it, for me.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
who thinks he knows what games ought to be,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and won't show the product to little girls.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
have one thing in common:

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
they don't listen to little girls.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They haven't looked at children

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'd like to play you some voices of little girls

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
actually, some of the voices are more recent.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that they took for us of their lives,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of the things that they value and care about.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and this is the kind of research I recommend to those

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
who want to do humanistic work.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Hers is more into boys.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
with clouds and flowers.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
like when I get Mondays and all those days off.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
all this different stuff that I have to do,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and sometimes it gets overwhelming.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Girl 9: My friend Justine

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and they take your idea and they do it themselves.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But she gives my sister everything.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Let's hope it's really stable.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
This is the second day in Rockett's life.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The reason I'm showing you this

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
in the game that we've created.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Nakilia invited Reuben too, but --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Miko: I don't think so.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Rockett: Really? What other party?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He's invited all the best people.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because I know I don't have a lot of time.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
we can go into this hidden hallway,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and I'll quickly just show you the interface.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and get some more information about her.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Oops, I turned the wrong way.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But you get the general idea of the product.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
is a kind of validation,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
a sense of being seen.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We love them.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We see them.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But we're really, really happy about who they are.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It turns out they're really great.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I want to close by showing you a videotape

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that our graphic artists and design people put together,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
"Rockett 28!"

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
BL: Thanks.
