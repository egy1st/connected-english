00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was walking in the market one day with my wife,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and somebody stuck a cage in my face.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And in between those slits

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That evening I came back to the market in the dark

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I heard "uhh, uhh,"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course, the cage was salvaged.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I took up the little baby,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
massaged her, forced her to drink

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
until she finally started breathing normally.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is Uce.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and this is Matahari, her second son,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That changed my life quite dramatically,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Applause)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
No. No. No. Wrong.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's not good.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
just now like victims for every baby,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
six have disappeared from the forest.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The deforestation, especially for oil palm,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to provide biofuel for Western countries

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is what's causing these problems.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When you open this for growing oil palms

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you're creating CO2 volcanoes

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that are emitting so much CO2

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
after China and the United States.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And we don't have any industry at all --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it's only because of this deforestation.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And these are horrible images.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm not going to talk too long about it,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but there are so many of the family of Uce,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that still have to go through that process.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And I don't know anymore where to put them.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but also a solution

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to get their hands on the last timber

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and that are causing, in that way,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the loss of habitat and all those victims.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So I created the place Samboja Lestari,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and the idea was,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
where there is really nothing left,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
No. Everyone should be able to follow this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
As you can see there's only yellow terrain.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
There was a huge amount of crime.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
There was no agricultural productivity left.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This was the poorest district in the whole province

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and it was a total extinction of wildlife.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This was like a biological desert.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
just this waving grass.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The climate has changed. I will show you:

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
no more flooding, no more fires.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's no longer the poorest district,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and there is a huge development of biodiversity.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We have 30 species of reptiles.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So basically the whole process of destruction

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But we saw the same thing.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We had slash and burn agriculture;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
people cannot afford the fertilizer,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the fires become more frequent,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and after a while you're stuck with an area of land

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
where there is no fertility left.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
There are no trees left.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Still, in this place, in this grassland

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
where you can see our very first office there on that hill,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(Applause)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And there are all these animals, and all these people happy,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and there's this economic value.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So how's this possible?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we bought the land, we dealt with the fire,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and then only, we started doing the reforestation

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
by combining agriculture with forestry.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But we made sure that in every step of the way

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the local people were going to be fully involved

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The people would become the defenders of that forest.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but we do it in addition

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to a sure legal status --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because if the forest belongs to the state,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And then we apply all these other principles

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
like transparency, professional management, measurable results,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
scalability, [unclear], etc.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
What we did was we formulated recipes --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to a target situation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Now in this recipe you also have the cost.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You also know how much labor is needed.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
If you can drop this recipe on the map

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
on a sandy soil, on a clay soil,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
on a steep slope, on flat soil,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you put those different recipes; if you combine them,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
out of that comes a business plan,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
comes a work plan, and you can optimize it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and you can do it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The acacia trees are of a very low value

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and to shake out the grasses.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that is, if you can preserve it in the right way,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
which we can do with bamboo peels.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So if we would plant that in the beginning

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So we plant it later, along the waterways

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to filter the water, provide the raw products

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
just in time for when the timber becomes available.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So the idea is: how to integrate these flows

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in space, over time and with the limited means you have.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
while even saving some money.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So beautiful. What a theory.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But is it really that easy?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the fire started.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This is an area of about 50 million hectares.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
January.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
February.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
March.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
April.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
May.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So how to break that cycle?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Fire is the biggest problem.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
This is what it looked like for three months.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
because it was that dark.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
for orangutans and people.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So these fires are really the first things to work on.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That was why I put it as a single point up there.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to the first rainfall -- going to the sea

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
killing off the coral reefs there.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So you have to do it with the local people.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So what we did is, we created

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a ring of sugar palms around the area.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
also flood-resistant, by the way --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and they provide a lot of income for local people.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is what it looks like:

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and the only thing you harvest is sugar water,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
In principle, you make those trees into

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
biological photovoltaic cells.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And you can create so much energy from this --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
they produce three times more energy per hectare per year,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
because you can tap them on a daily basis.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
You don't need to harvest [unclear]

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
or any other of the crops.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So we bought that land,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and here is where we started our project --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in the middle of nowhere.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is divided into strips that go over different types of soil,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and we were actually monitoring,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And this forest is quite different.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
What I really did was I just followed nature,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and nature doesn't know monocultures,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but a natural forest is multilayered.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
That means that both in the ground and above the ground

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
it can make better use of the available light,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So, just like nature,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that can optimally use that light. Then,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
what is just as important: get the right fungi in there

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And they become like nutrient pumps.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We didn't want to lose the people

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that are going to work in that plantation.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And we do a lot of work here.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
This is what it looks like in reality;

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
you have this irregular ring around it,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that can provide income for 648 families.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's only a small part of the area.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The nursery, in here, is quite different.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
from the Urals up to England, you know how many?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
165.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Can you imagine?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You do need to know what you are working with,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
but it's that diversity which makes it work.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
That you can go from this zero situation,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in the lines in that grass there,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
there are crops that can be used.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And then slowly, the trees start taking over,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and provides the people with permanent income.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
On the top left, underneath those green stripes,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that you can see from space.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that you just saw before.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So this is after one year.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And this is after two years.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And that's green. If you look from the tower --

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
this is when we start attacking the grass.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We plant in the seedlings

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
(Applause)

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Air humidity is up 10 percent.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Rainfall is up.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And all these species and income.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
This ecolodge that I built here,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
three years before, was an empty, yellow field.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
is taking a picture.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We can use these data now

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We actually have it already with Google Earth.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and use Google Earth in combination with that,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
which company is stealing the timber,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and you could save so much more carbon

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
than with any measure of saving energy here.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So this is the Samboja Lestari area.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
You measure how the trees grow back,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
how many medicines can be kept here.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And finally I made it into the rain machine

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
because this forest is now creating its own rain.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and we have now a lot of intrusion there.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest;

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And look at these images.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'll just run them very quickly through.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which is the case in the temperate zones,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that initiate the raindrops.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and you have the trees to initiate the rain.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds --

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
already, after three years.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Let's look at the next year,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and you can see that that trend is continuing.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that cap is now widening and getting higher.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And if we look at the rainfall pattern

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So you can actually change the climate.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
because we actually can make that difference

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
if you integrate the various technologies.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
on your education.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We have our farmer schools.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
But the real success of course, is our band --

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and you don't make trouble with your family.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
This is how it looks.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
We have this road going around the area,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
We have the zone with the sugar palms,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and then we have this fence with very thorny palms

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and the people apart.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And inside, we have this area for reforestation

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
as a gene bank to keep all that material alive,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
because for the last 12 years

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
because the climatic triggers have disappeared.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
All the seeds get eaten.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So now we do the monitoring on the inside --

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
from towers, satellites, ultralights.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees --

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
you have the shade trees planted in year one,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
then you underplanted with the sugar palms,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
and you plant this thorny fence.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
They have enough income for three families.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
There is no simple one recipe for one place.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt --

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
that it's transparent.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Like here, in Samboja Lestari,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
If one member trespasses the agreement,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and does cut down trees,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
If the group doesn't take action,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative --

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
they have a democratic culture there,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
They also get free land in between the trees,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
where they can grow their crops.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
They get building material for houses,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
a contract for selling the sugar,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
They get all these other benefits: environmentally, money,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
they get education -- it's a great deal.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And everything is based upon that one thing --

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
make sure that forest remains there.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So if we want to help the orangutans --

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
what I actually set out to do --

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Now I think the real key to doing it, to give a simple answer,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
is integration.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I hope -- if you want to know more, you can read more.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:17.000
