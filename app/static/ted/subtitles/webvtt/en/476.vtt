00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because of their tall stature, their complex structure,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I used to climb trees for fun all the time

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and forests, through the medium of science.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and share with you what canopy researchers are asking

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's start our journey on the forest floor

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you'll notice that the understory is very dark,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it's very still.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but rather showing you a very short clip

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
from a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to climb a giant strangler fig.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Music)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Growling)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Rustling)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to make their way and their life in the canopy.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and tell you about the ants.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
people who describe and name animals -- have named.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
One of the reasons I tell you about ants

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We've had two children, August Andrew and Erika

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and actually, he named ants after them.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But my passion -- in addition to Jack and my children --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
those plants that grow up on trees.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
These plants occur in great diversity,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
over 28,000 species around the world.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
They grow in tropical forests like this one

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And these mosses, generated by decomposing,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
are like peat moss in your garden.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
One of the surprising things I discovered

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
what you'll find underneath them are connections, networks

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
of what we call canopy roots.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
These are not epiphyte roots:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We've done stripping experiments

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
where we've removed mats of epiphytes

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and looked at the rates of recolonization.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and that they would come in encroaching from the side.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
over 20 years -- to regenerate,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
starting from the bottom and growing up.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And even now, after 25 years,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And I use this little image to say

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
this is what happens to mosses.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
If it's gone, it's gone,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So, recolonization is really very slow.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
These canopy communities are fragile.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of the intact primary forest,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We know it's a lot,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but we do not yet know the answers to how much,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that Tarzan and Jane were interested in,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
but rather that they foster biodiversity

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and they also help to keep our global climate stable.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you would also see scenes like this.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and forest fragmentation,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
when it is not disturbed by humans.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I've also looked out on urban places like this

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
People who grew up in a place like this

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and forests, as I did when I was a young girl.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This troubles me.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and trying to figure out how we can answer them.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
far away from the areas of power and money,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
How can I reconnect people with trees?"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Well, I think that I can do something.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I know that as a scientist, I have information

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
inside or outside of academia.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And so, that's what I've begin doing,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
We consult to the media about canopy questions;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
we have a canopy newsletter;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
we have an email LISTSERV.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the beauty of the canopy,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the necessity of intact canopies,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
to people outside of academia.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
those videos and so forth --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
you know, they don't reach everybody,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
What we do, my students in my lab and I,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and we send her out with a canopy handbook.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And my feeling is --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Applause)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Thank you.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(Applause)

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
-- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to become an ambassador who can carry the message

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We've also made partnerships with artists,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of trees and forest canopies.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The results have been fantastic.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I'll just give you a few examples.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
at Rhode Island School of Design.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We've had dance people up in the canopy.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
They made a fabulous dance called "Biome."

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
They danced in the forest,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and also linking up with environmental groups,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to go to different cities and to perform

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the science, the dance and the environmental outreach

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that we hope will make a difference.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We brought musicians to the canopy,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
we had opera singers, we had guitar players,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and we had rap singers.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I brought a little segment to give you

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
(Music) That's Duke!

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
(Applause)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This experience of working with Duke

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I don't have a hope of getting to --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Caution would rap on it,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and suddenly that branch was really cool.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And then the students would come into our sound studios,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They ended up making a CD

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
which they took home to their family and friends,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
thereby expressing their own experiences with nature

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
in their own medium.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and it involves an economic and social value

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that is associated with epiphytic plants.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
In the Pacific Northwest,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
from old-growth forests.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
These mosses are taken from the forest;

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's a 265 million dollar industry

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and it's increasing rapidly.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If you remember that bald guy,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
is going to take decades and decades to come back.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So this whole industry is unsustainable.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that would be great.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
who don't have access to nature,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
who often have a lot of time, they often have space,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
would be great partners.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And they have become excellent partners.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The best I can imagine.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
They were very enthusiastic.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
(Applause)

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
which, to tell you the truth,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
in order to grow these mosses.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We've been successful as partners

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in figuring out which species grow the fastest,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We gave talks once a month,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and that actually ended up implementing

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Our latest endeavor,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
with a grant

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So they will raise them -- in captivity, of course --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And they will have the pleasure, many of them,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And so, I think for many reasons --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
this has been a tremendous project

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and I'm really looking forward to

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
not only myself and my students doing it,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to have their own partnerships

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
with people outside of the academic community.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and make an opera about AIDS.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that would really make you clap your hands.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it is time for scientists to reach outward,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
with the tools of science.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
By making these partnerships that I described to you,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
to have a greater understanding,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to make other discoveries about nature and myself.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
When I look into my heart, I see trees --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
this is actually an image of a real heart --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
there are trees in our hearts,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
there are trees in your hearts.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
When we come to understand nature,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
In these partnerships, I have also learned

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that people tend to compartmentalize themselves

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
but when we share nature,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
when we share our perspectives about nature,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
we find a common denominator.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Finally, as a scientist and as a person

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and now, as part of the TED community,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I feel that I have better tools

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
to make new discoveries about nature --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and about humans' place in nature

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
wherever we are and whomever you are.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
(Applause)
