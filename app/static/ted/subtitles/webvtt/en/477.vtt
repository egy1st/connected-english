00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.064
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:05.858
to a little town
in Colorado, called Craig.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.699
It's only a couple dozen square miles.

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:08.961
It's in the Rockies.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.529
And the job in question was sheep rancher.

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:15.336
My role on the show, for those of you
who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.546
I'm an apprentice,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.294
and I work with the people
who do the jobs in question.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:22.294
And my responsibilities
are to simply try and keep up,

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:25.516
and give an honest account
of what it's like to be these people

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.976
for one day in their life.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.574
The job in question: herding sheep.

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:30.751
Great.

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.086
We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.226
and I realize the next day

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.251
that castration is going to be
an absolute part of this work.

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:42.976
Normally, I never do any research at all.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.487
But this is a touchy subject,
and I work for the Discovery Channel,

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:51.118
and we want to portray accurately
whatever it is we do.

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:55.976
And we certainly want to do it
with a lot of respect for the animals.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.064
So I call the Humane Society and I say,

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:01.502
"Look, I'm going to be castrating
some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:04.063
And they're like, "Yeah,
it's pretty straightforward."

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:10.128
They use a band, basically, a rubber band,
like this, only a little smaller.

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:12.349
This one was actually
around the playing cards

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:13.556
I got yesterday --

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.102
(Laughter)

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:17.017
But it had a certain familiarity to it.

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.223
And I said, "Well, what exactly
is the process?"

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.092
And they said, "The band
is applied to the tail, tightly.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.480
And then another band is applied
to the scrotum, tightly.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.976
Blood flow is slowly retarded;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.096
a week later the parts
in question fall off.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.272
"Great -- got it."

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.879
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:36.070
They confirm it.

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:37.560
I also call PETA just for fun,

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:39.730
and they don't like it,
but they confirm it.

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:41.441
OK, that's basically how you do it.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:42.853
So the next day I go out.

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.222
And I'm given a horse
and we go get the lambs

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.282
and we take them to a pen that we built,

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:50.976
and we go about the business
of animal husbandry.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.445
Melanie is the wife of Albert.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.166
Albert is the shepherd in question.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.273
Melanie picks up the lamb,
one hand on both legs on the right,

00:01:58.297 --> 00:01:59.710
likewise on the left.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.913
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.

00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:03.111
Alright. Great.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:05.782
Albert goes in, I follow Albert,
the crew is around.

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:09.281
I always watch the process done
the first time before I try it.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.592
Being an apprentice,
you know, you do that.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:15.194
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out,
you know, this black rubber band,

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.218
but what comes out instead is a knife.

00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:21.053
And I'm like, "Hmm, that's not
rubber at all," you know?

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:22.266
(Laughter)

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.084
And he kind of flicked it open
in a way that caught the sun

00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:27.646
that was just coming
over the Rockies, it was very --

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.186
(Laughter)

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.397
It was ... it was impressive.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.806
In the space of about two seconds,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.611
Albert had the knife
between the cartilage of the tail,

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.282
right next to the butt of the lamb,

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:43.842
and very quickly, the tail was gone
and in the bucket that I was holding.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:47.435
A second later, with a big thumb
and a well-calloused forefinger,

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.362
he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:52.211
And he pulled it toward him, like so,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.449
and he took the knife
and he put it on the tip.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.083
"Now, you think you know
what's coming, Michael,

00:02:57.107 --> 00:02:58.369
You don't, OK?"

00:02:58.393 --> 00:02:59.413
(Laughter)

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:02.322
He snips it, throws the tip
over his shoulder,

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:04.662
and then grabs the scrotum
and pushes it upward,

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:08.585
and then his head dips down,
obscuring my view.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.816
But what I hear is a slurping sound,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.753
and a noise that sounds like Velcro
being yanked off a sticky wall,

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.180
and I am not even kidding.

00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:18.877
Can we roll the video?

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:20.243
No, I'm kidding, we don't --

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.263
(Laughter)

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.527
I thought it best to talk in pictures.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:29.271
I do something now I've never, ever done
on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.976
I say, "Time out. Stop."

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:34.545
You guys know the show, we use take one;
we don't do take two.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.487
There's no writing, there's no scripting,
there's no nonsense.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.664
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.086
we shoot what we get!

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.231
I said, "Stop. This is nuts."

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.409
I mean --

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.718
(Laughter)

00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:46.922
"This is crazy.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.219
We can't do this."

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:50.491
And Albert's like, "What?"

00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:52.712
And I'm like, "I don't know
what just happened,

00:03:52.736 --> 00:03:54.668
but there are testicles in this bucket,

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.108
and that's not how we do it."

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.890
He said "Well, that's how we do it."

00:03:57.914 --> 00:03:59.857
I said, "Why would you do it this way?"

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:01.548
And before I even let him explain,

00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:04.553
I said, "I want to do it the right way,
with the rubber bands."

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.471
And he says, "Like the Humane Society?"

00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:08.333
I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.

00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:11.942
Let's do something that doesn't make
the lamb squeal and bleed.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.592
We're on in five continents, dude!

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:16.400
We're on twice a day
on the Discovery -- we can't do this."

00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:17.603
He says, "OK."

00:04:17.627 --> 00:04:20.880
He goes to his box and pulls out
a bag of these little rubber bands.

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.412
Melanie picks up another lamb,
puts it on the post,

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:26.154
band goes on the tail,
band goes on the scrotum.

00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:29.950
Lamb goes on the ground,
lamb takes two steps, falls down,

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:32.449
gets up, shakes a little,

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:34.464
takes another couple steps, falls down.

00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:38.823
I'm like, this is not a good sign
for this lamb, at all.

00:04:38.847 --> 00:04:40.520
Gets up, walks to the corner.

00:04:40.544 --> 00:04:44.133
It's quivering, and it lies
down and it's in obvious distress.

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:47.976
And I'm looking at the lamb
and I say, "Albert, how long?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.312
When does he get up?"

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.037
He's like, "A day?"

00:04:51.587 --> 00:04:54.225
I said, "A day! How long does
it take them to fall off?"

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.424
"A week."

00:04:55.448 --> 00:05:00.806
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done
his little procedure on

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.900
is, you know, he's just prancing
around, bleeding stopped.

00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:07.672
He's, you know, nibbling
on some grass, frolicking.

00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:13.202
And I was just so blown away
at how completely wrong I was,

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:14.841
in that second.

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:18.960
And I was reminded how utterly wrong
I am, so much of the time.

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.080
(Laughter)

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:21.896
And I was especially reminded

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.192
of what a ridiculously
short straw I had that day,

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:27.683
because now I had to do
what Albert had just done,

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:30.362
and there are like 100
of these lambs in the pen.

00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:34.553
And suddenly, this whole thing's starting
to feel like a German porno,

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:35.892
and I'm like --

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:38.469
(Laughter)

00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:42.050
Melanie picks up the lamb,
puts it on the post, opens it up.

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.341
Albert hands me the knife.

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.064
I go in, tail comes off.

00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:48.194
I go in, I grab the scrotum,
tip comes off.

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:50.564
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."

00:05:50.588 --> 00:05:51.739
I do.

00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:52.914
"Push it further."

00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:54.089
I do.

00:05:54.113 --> 00:05:57.388
The testicles emerge. They look
like thumbs, coming right at you.

00:05:57.412 --> 00:05:59.031
And he says, "Bite 'em.

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:01.035
Just bite 'em off."

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.185
(Laughter)

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.298
And I heard him, I heard all the words --

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:08.910
(Laughter)

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:10.553
Like, how did I get here?

00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:12.459
How did -- I mean --

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:13.815
how did I get here?

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:19.828
It's just -- it's one of those moments
where the brain goes off on its own,

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:22.976
and suddenly, I'm standing
there in the Rockies,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.386
and all I can think of is the Aristotelian
definition of a tragedy.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.511
You know, Aristotle says
a tragedy is that moment

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:35.091
when the hero comes face to face
with his true identity.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.460
(Laughter)

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:38.766
And I'm like, "What is this
jacked-up metaphor?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.838
I don't like what I'm thinking right now."

00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:42.955
And I can't get this thought
out of my head,

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.087
and I can't get that vision
out of my sight,

00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.440
so I did what I had to do.

00:06:47.464 --> 00:06:49.465
I went in and I took them.

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:50.850
I took them like this,

00:06:50.874 --> 00:06:52.647
and I yanked my head back.

00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:57.489
And I'm standing there
with two testicles on my chin.

00:06:57.513 --> 00:06:59.434
(Laughter)

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:02.610
And now I can't get --
I can't shake the metaphor.

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:06.276
I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle,
and I'm thinking --

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.775
out of nowhere, two terms come crashing
into my head, that I hadn't heard

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:12.915
since my classics professor in college
drilled them there.

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.608
And they are "anagnorisis"
and "peripeteia."

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.959
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:21.890
Anagnorisis is the Greek
word for discovery.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.346
Literally, the transition from ignorance
to knowledge is anagnorisis.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.712
It's what our network does;
it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.

00:07:31.736 --> 00:07:35.774
And I'm up to my neck
in anagnorises every single day.

00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:36.953
Great.

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:39.115
The other word, peripeteia,

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:44.453
that's the moment
in the great tragedies --

00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:46.715
Euripides and Sophocles.

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:52.244
That's the moment where Oedipus has
his moment, where he suddenly realizes

00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:55.163
that hot chick he's been sleeping with
and having babies with

00:07:55.187 --> 00:07:56.586
is his mother.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.605
That's peripety, or peripeteia.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:01.788
And this metaphor in my head --

00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:04.553
I've got anagnorisis
and peripeteia on my chin --

00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:06.842
(Laughter)

00:08:06.866 --> 00:08:09.470
I've got to tell you,
it's such a great device, though.

00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:12.067
When you start to look for peripeteia,

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.628
you find it everywhere.

00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:16.565
I mean, Bruce Willis
in "The Sixth Sense," right?

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.145
Spends the whole movie trying to help
the little kid who sees dead people,

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:21.894
and then -- boom! -- "Oh, I'm dead."

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.078
Peripeteia. You know?

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.572
It's crushing when the audience
sees it the right way.

00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:29.097
Neo in "The Matrix," you know?

00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.096
"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.683
That's weird."

00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:35.640
These discoveries
that lead to sudden realizations.

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:38.960
And I've been having them,
over 200 dirty jobs,

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:41.116
I have them all the time, but that one --

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.612
that one drilled something home
in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.593
And, as I stood there,

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:53.683
looking at the happy lamb
that I had just defiled --

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.496
but it looked OK;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.797
looking at that poor other little thing
that I'd done it the right way on,

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.475
and I just was struck by --

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:05.729
if I'm wrong about that,

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:08.120
and if I'm wrong so often,
in a literal way,

00:09:08.144 --> 00:09:13.431
what other peripatetic misconceptions
might I be able to comment upon?

00:09:13.455 --> 00:09:15.932
Because, look --
I'm not a social anthropologist,

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.272
but I have a friend who is.

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:18.976
And I talk to him.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.527
(Laughter)

00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.053
And he says, "Hey Mike, look.

00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:26.061
I don't know if your brain is interested
in this sort of thing or not,

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:28.355
but do you realize
you've shot in every state?

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.651
You've worked in mining,
you've worked in fishing,

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.343
you've worked in steel,
you've worked in every major industry.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.422
You've had your back
shoulder to shoulder with these guys

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:42.052
that our politicians are desperate
to relate to every four years, right?"

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:44.692
I can still see Hillary
doing the shots of rye,

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:47.016
dribbling down her chin,
with the steel workers.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.239
I mean, these are the people
that I work with every single day.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.647
"And if you have something to say
about their thoughts, collectively,

00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.585
it might be time to think about it.

00:09:56.609 --> 00:10:00.176
Because, dude, you know, four years."

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.427
So, that's in my head,
testicles are on my chin,

00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:06.336
thoughts are bouncing around.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.729
And, after that shoot,
"Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,

00:10:11.753 --> 00:10:15.207
in terms of what the show is,
but it changed for me, personally.

00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:17.110
And now, when I talk about the show,

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:22.459
I no longer just tell the story
you heard and 190 like it.

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:26.715
I do, but I also start to talk
about some of the other things

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:27.914
I got wrong;

00:10:27.938 --> 00:10:29.964
some of the other notions of work

00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:33.174
that I've just been assuming
are sacrosanct,

00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.045
and they're not.

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.976
People with dirty jobs
are happier than you think.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.011
As a group, they're
the happiest people I know.

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:44.017
And I don't want to start whistling
"Look for the Union Label,"

00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:45.525
and all that happy-worker crap.

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:47.946
I'm just telling you
that these are balanced people

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.125
who do unthinkable work.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.250
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle
while they work, I swear to God --

00:10:52.274 --> 00:10:53.428
I did it with them.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.657
They've got this amazing
sort of symmetry to their life.

00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:00.310
And I see it over and over and over again.

00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:02.424
So I started to wonder what would happen

00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:05.195
if we challenged
some of these sacred cows?

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:07.203
Follow your passion --

00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:10.233
we've been talking about it
here for the last 36 hours.

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.817
Follow your passion -- what could
possibly be wrong with that?

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.844
It's probably the worst advice I ever got.

00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:16.942
(Laughter)

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:18.844
Follow your dreams and go broke, right?

00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:20.690
I mean, that's all I heard growing up.

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:22.540
I didn't know what to do with my life,

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:25.705
but I was told if you follow your passion,
it's going to work out.

00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:27.530
I can give you 30 examples right now.

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:29.627
Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas

00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:32.309
who collects the uneaten scraps
of food from the casinos

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.020
and feeds them to his swine.

00:11:34.044 --> 00:11:35.195
Why?

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:37.993
Because there's so much protein
in the stuff we don't eat,

00:11:38.017 --> 00:11:41.334
his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,
and he's one rich pig farmer.

00:11:41.358 --> 00:11:42.795
He's good for the environment,

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:45.123
he spends his days
doing this incredible service,

00:11:45.147 --> 00:11:47.155
and he smells like hell,
but God bless him.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:48.477
He's making a great living.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.770
You ask him, "Did you follow
your passion here?"

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.949
and he'd laugh at you.

00:11:51.973 --> 00:11:56.218
The guy's worth -- he just got offered
like 60 million dollars for his farm

00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.448
and turned it down, outside of Vegas.

00:11:58.472 --> 00:11:59.893
He didn't follow his passion.

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.863
He stepped back and he watched
where everybody was going,

00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:05.072
and he went the other way.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.116
And I hear that story over and over.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.712
Matt Freund, a dairy farmer
in New Canaan, Connecticut,

00:12:10.736 --> 00:12:12.462
who woke up one day and realized

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:15.199
the crap from his cows
was worth more than their milk,

00:12:15.223 --> 00:12:19.105
if he could use it to make
these biodegradable flowerpots.

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:22.279
Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?

00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:25.131
Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.

00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:27.693
So I started to look at passion,

00:12:27.717 --> 00:12:31.815
I started to look
at efficiency vs. effectiveness.

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:35.008
As Tim talked about earlier,
that's a huge distinction.

00:12:35.032 --> 00:12:37.511
I started to look at teamwork
and determination.

00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:40.531
And basically, all those platitudes
they call "successories"

00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:44.482
that hang with that schmaltzy art
in boardrooms around the world right now,

00:12:44.506 --> 00:12:48.954
that stuff -- it's suddenly
all been turned on its head.

00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:52.968
Safety. Safety first is ...

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:57.001
Going back to OSHA and PETA
and the Humane Society:

00:12:57.025 --> 00:12:59.301
What if OSHA got it wrong?

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:01.672
I mean -- this is heresy,
what I'm about to say --

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:04.115
but what if it's really safety third?

00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:05.693
Right?

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:07.143
(Laughter)

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.269
No, I mean, really.

00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:11.212
What I mean to say is:

00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.700
I value my safety on these crazy jobs

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:16.286
as much as the people
that I'm working with,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.586
but the ones who really get it done --

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.430
they're not out there
talking about safety first.

00:13:21.954 --> 00:13:23.976
They know that other things come first --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.048
the business of doing
the work comes first,

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.895
the business of getting it done.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:30.680
And I'll never forget,
up in the Bering Sea,

00:13:30.704 --> 00:13:33.438
I was on a crab boat
with the "Deadliest Catch" guys --

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:35.754
which I also work on in the first season.

00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:38.454
We were about 100 miles
off the coast of Russia:

00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:42.875
50-foot seas, big waves, green water
coming over the wheelhouse, right?

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:44.976
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.898
and I was back with a guy,
lashing the pots down.

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.078
So I'm 40 feet off the deck,

00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:53.000
which is like looking down
at the top of your shoe, you know,

00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:54.631
and it's doing this in the ocean.

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:55.811
Unspeakably dangerous.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.769
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:00.546
and I say, with some level of incredulity,

00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:02.951
"Captain -- OSHA?"

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.047
And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:06.976
And he points out there.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.331
(Laughter)

00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:15.306
But in that moment, what he said next
can't be repeated in the Lower 48.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.931
It can't be repeated on any factory floor
or any construction site.

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.840
But he looked at me and said, "Son," --

00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.611
he's my age, by the way,
he calls me "son," I love that --

00:14:23.635 --> 00:14:25.810
he says, "Son, I'm the captain
of a crab boat.

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:28.403
My responsibility
is not to get you home alive.

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:30.773
My responsibility
is to get you home rich."

00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:32.261
(Laughter)

00:14:32.285 --> 00:14:34.491
You want to get home alive,
that's on you."

00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:37.143
And for the rest
of that day -- safety first.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.810
I mean, I was like --

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:45.144
So, the idea that we create
this sense of complacency

00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:49.667
when all we do is talk
about somebody else's responsibility

00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:51.624
as though it's our own, and vice versa.

00:14:51.648 --> 00:14:53.270
Anyhow, a whole lot of things.

00:14:53.294 --> 00:14:56.721
I could talk at length
about the many little distinctions we made

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.601
and the endless list of ways
that I got it wrong.

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.960
But what it all comes down to is this:

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.179
I've formed a theory,

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:06.618
and I'm going to share it now
in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

00:15:06.642 --> 00:15:08.090
It goes like this:

00:15:08.853 --> 00:15:13.817
we've declared war on work,
as a society -- all of us.

00:15:13.841 --> 00:15:15.344
It's a civil war.

00:15:15.773 --> 00:15:17.666
It's a cold war, really.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.976
We didn't set out to do it

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.621
and we didn't twist our mustache
in some Machiavellian way,

00:15:23.645 --> 00:15:24.867
but we've done it.

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:28.590
And we've waged this war
on at least four fronts,

00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:30.097
certainly in Hollywood.

00:15:30.121 --> 00:15:32.731
The way we portray working people on TV --

00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:33.976
it's laughable.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.774
If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds

00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:37.889
and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.

00:15:37.913 --> 00:15:39.164
You see him all the time.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.669
That's what plumbers look like, right?

00:15:41.693 --> 00:15:44.881
We turn them into heroes,
or we turn them into punch lines.

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:46.087
That's what TV does.

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.452
We try hard on "Dirty Jobs"
not to do that,

00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:50.908
which is why I do the work
and I don't cheat.

00:15:52.222 --> 00:15:54.862
But, we've waged this war
on Madison Avenue.

00:15:55.111 --> 00:15:59.500
So many of the commercials that come out
there in the way of a message --

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:00.977
what's really being said?

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:03.783
"Your life would be better
if you could work a little less,

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:06.640
didn't have to work so hard,
got home a little earlier,

00:16:06.664 --> 00:16:09.353
could retire a little faster,
punch out a little sooner."

00:16:09.377 --> 00:16:12.001
It's all in there,
over and over, again and again.

00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:13.176
Washington?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.231
I can't even begin to talk
about the deals and policies in place

00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:19.764
that affect the bottom-line reality
of the available jobs,

00:16:19.788 --> 00:16:23.351
because I don't really know; I just know
that that's a front in this war.

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.470
And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.

00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:28.560
I mean -- how many people have
an iPhone on them right now?

00:16:28.584 --> 00:16:30.427
How many people have their BlackBerry?

00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:32.241
We're plugged in; we're connected.

00:16:32.265 --> 00:16:34.528
I would never suggest for a second

00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:37.523
that something bad
has come out of the tech revolution.

00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:39.142
Good grief, not to this crowd.

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.297
(Laughter)

00:16:41.321 --> 00:16:42.604
But I would suggest

00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:47.402
that innovation without imitation
is a complete waste of time.

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:50.445
And nobody celebrates imitation

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:54.211
the way "Dirty Jobs" guys
know it has to be done.

00:16:54.235 --> 00:16:57.647
Your iPhone without those people
making the same interface,

00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:00.131
the same circuitry,
the same board, over and over --

00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:03.663
all of that -- that's what makes
it equally as possible

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:06.873
as the genius that goes inside of it.

00:17:06.897 --> 00:17:09.730
So, we've got this new toolbox. You know?

00:17:09.754 --> 00:17:13.340
Our tools today don't look
like shovels and picks.

00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:16.447
They look like the stuff
we walk around with.

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:21.690
And so the collective
effect of all of that

00:17:21.714 --> 00:17:27.123
has been this marginalization
of lots and lots of jobs.

00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:30.150
And I realized, probably
too late in this game --

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:33.628
I hope not, because I don't know
if I can do 200 more of these things --

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.567
but we're going to do as many as we can.

00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:37.652
And to me, the most
important thing to know

00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:39.508
and to really come face to face with,

00:17:39.532 --> 00:17:42.305
is that fact that I got it wrong
about a lot of things,

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.389
not just the testicles on my chin.

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:46.976
I got a lot wrong.

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:51.752
So, we're thinking --
by "we," I mean me --

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.666
(Laughter)

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:58.217
that the thing to do is to talk
about a PR campaign for work --

00:17:58.853 --> 00:18:01.130
manual labor, skilled labor.

00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:06.443
Somebody needs to be out there,
talking about the forgotten benefits.

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:08.228
I'm talking about grandfather stuff,

00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:10.199
the stuff a lot us probably grew up with

00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:14.456
but we've kind of --
you know, kind of lost a little.

00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:17.835
Barack wants to create
two and a half million jobs.

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:20.038
The infrastructure is a huge deal.

00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:24.118
This war on work that I suppose exists,
has casualties like any other war.

00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:25.976
The infrastructure is the first one,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.963
declining trade school enrollments
are the second one.

00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:33.828
Every single year, fewer electricians,
fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,

00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:38.118
fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters,
fewer steam fitters.

00:18:38.709 --> 00:18:42.380
The infrastructure jobs that everybody
is talking about creating

00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:46.080
are those guys -- the ones
that have been in decline, over and over.

00:18:46.104 --> 00:18:49.110
Meanwhile, we've got
two trillion dollars, at a minimum,

00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:51.683
according to the American Society
of Civil Engineers,

00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:54.842
that we need to expend
to even make a dent in the infrastructure,

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.112
which is currently rated at a D minus.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:01.661
So, if I were running
for anything -- and I'm not --

00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:04.294
I would simply say
that the jobs we hope to make

00:19:04.318 --> 00:19:06.372
and the jobs we hope to create

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.486
aren't going to stick unless
they're jobs that people want.

00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:12.526
And I know the point of this conference

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.457
is to celebrate things
that are near and dear to us,

00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.485
but I also know that clean
and dirty aren't opposites.

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:22.130
They're two sides of the same coin,
just like innovation and imitation,

00:19:22.154 --> 00:19:27.239
like risk and responsibility,
like peripeteia and anagnorisis,

00:19:27.263 --> 00:19:30.894
like that poor little lamb,
who I hope isn't quivering anymore,

00:19:30.918 --> 00:19:32.410
and like my time that's gone.

00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:34.440
It's been great talking to you.

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:35.976
And get back to work, will you?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
(Applause)
