WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The new me is beauty.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(Laughter)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but it would be ugly."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is neat.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you for setting up my display.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I mean, it's just wonderful.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but I want it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And that's my new life.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and "pretty," and "emotions."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.680
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house --

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.720
(Laughter)

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.720
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.720
and it comes with a little slip of paper

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
The acid will ruin the gold plating.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
(Laughter)

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.720
and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
(Laughter)

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.720
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.880
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced:

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.280
it holds well, it feels well.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320
It's a delight to use.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
And so it's got everything, right?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
It's beautiful and it's functional.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.320
And I can tell you stories about it,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320
which makes it reflective,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
And those are the three components.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
with fish swimming in it.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.320
the ripples spread out and the fish run away.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320
But of course, then the ball hits the other side,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
(Laughter)

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.320
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320
No. But is it fun?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.320
Yeah! Yeah.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
Or look at Google.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.320
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.320
you get 10 pages of results.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.320
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.320
This is one through 20. Next,"

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.360
they just give you as many o's as there are pages.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
It's really simple and subtle.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360
That's the subconscious mind

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360
that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360
and you didn't know why.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360
And it's just clever.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360
And of course, what's especially good is,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
if you type "design and emotion,"

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.360
the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360
(Laughter)

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360
Now, the weird thing is Google lies,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360
because if I type "design and emotion,"

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360
it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
So, OK.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360
So I type "design emotion"

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.360
and my website wasn't first again.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.360
It was third.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360
Oh well, different story.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.080
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.080
about the MINI Cooper automobile.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.360
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.360
Buy it anyway.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360
It's so much fun to drive."

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.360
And if you look at the inside of the car --

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360
I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.360
this is me taking a picture while my son is driving --

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.360
and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360
It's round, it's neat.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360
The controls work wonderfully.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.360
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
and that never made any sense to me

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
until I finally figured out -- look ...

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.360
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.360
and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.360
I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360
No problem.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.360
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.360
and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.640
Intense fear paralyzes you.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640
It actually affects the way the brain works.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.640
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.640
until just a few days or hours before the talk,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.640
and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.640
That's what fear and anxiety does;

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing --

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.640
to focus, not be distracted.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.640
And I couldn't force myself across that.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.640
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640
But it really changes the way you think.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.640
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.640
did this wonderful experiment.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.640
She brought students in to solve problems.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.640
So, she'd bring people into the room,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640
and there'd be a string hanging down here

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.640
and a string hanging down here.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.640
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it --

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.640
some papers and scissors and stuff.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.640
And she'd bring them in,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.640
and she'd say,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640
"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Would you tie those two strings together?"

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.640
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.640
and they couldn't reach the other string.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.640
Still can't reach it.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.640
And, basically, none of them could solve it.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.640
You bring in a second group of people,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.640
and you say, "Oh, before we start,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640
I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.640
Would you like the box of candy?"

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.640
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.640
not very happy, but a little bit of happy.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.640
And guess what -- they solved the problem.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.640
And it turns out that when you're anxious

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.640
you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.640
makes you depth-first.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.640
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence --

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.640
you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640
which makes you a breadth-first problem solver:

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.640
you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640
That's what brainstorming is about, right?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.640
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.640
and we say, "No criticism,"

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.640
and you get all these weird, neat ideas.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.640
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.640
because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.640
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.640
You've got be anxious.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.640
The brain works differently

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.640
if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.640
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.640
No big deal.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.040
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.080
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to
like bright colors.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.080
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
and bright plants, because you eat the fruit

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.080
and you thereby spread the seed.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.080
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.080
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.080
we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.080
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080
we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.480
So that's the visceral level.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.480
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.480
like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.480
Or the 1963 Jaguar:

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.480
It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.480
but the owners love it.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.480
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480
A water bottle:

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.480
You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.480
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.480
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.480
It's all about the visceral experience.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.200
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200
and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.200
Almost everything we do is subconscious.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.200
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.200
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200
it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200
Most of what we do is subconscious.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200
controlled by the behavioral side.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.200
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200
which includes usability, understanding --

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.200
but also the feel and heft.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200
That's why the Global knives are so neat.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.200
that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.240
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.280
over a demanding curb --

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.280
again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.280
Or the sensual feeling.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.280
and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.280
It will squirt you all around

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.280
and you can stay in that shower for hours --

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.280
and not waste water, by the way,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.280
because it recirculates the same dirty water.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.280
(Laughter)

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.280
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.280
at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.280
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280
That's kind of what the teapot looks like

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.520
but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.560
and you put tea in,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.560
and then you fill it with water.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.560
The water then seeps over the tea.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.560
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right --

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.560
the tea is to the right of this line.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.560
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.560
and the water is filling it up like that.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.560
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.560
And that means the tea is partially covered

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.560
while it completes the brewing.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.560
And when it's finished, you put it vertically,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.560
and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.560
and the water only comes to here --

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.560
and so it keeps the tea out.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.560
On top of that, it communicates,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.560
which is what emotion does.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.560
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.560
It's being safe in the world.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.560
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it --

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.560
saying good, bad, safe, dangerous,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560
and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.560
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else --

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.560
because their muscles are acting, subconsciously,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.560
except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.560
Well, this has emotions if you like,

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.560
because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.560
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.560
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.560
And the third level is reflective,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.560
which is, if you like the superego,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.560
it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.560
no control over the -- doesn't see the senses,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.560
doesn't control the muscles.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560
It looks over what's going on.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.560
It's that little voice in your head

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.560
that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.560
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.040
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.080
Here's a great reflective product.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.080
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life --

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.080
all sorts of exotic cars,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.080
but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.720
It's about attention. It's about their image,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.760
not about the car.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.760
If you want a more positive model --

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760
this is the GM car.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760
And you'll buy it to protect the environment,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.760
even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.760
and not perfected.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760
But that's reflective design as well.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.760
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people --

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.760
"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.760
As opposed to this one,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760
which is a pure behavioral watch,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.760
which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.760
But it's ugly.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760
This is a clear Don Norman watch.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.760
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.760
the visceral fear of falling

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.760
against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.760
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.760
So, it's pitting one against the other.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.840
The other neat thing ...

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.840
(Laughter)

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.840
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.840
and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.840
And this is his chair with claw,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.840
and the poor little chair has lost its ball

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.840
and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.840
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.840
And that's what's nice about emotion.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.840
So that's the new me.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840
(Laughter)

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.840
(Applause)
