WEBVTT

00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:02.907
I've been intrigued by this question

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:07.358
of whether we could evolve
or develop a sixth sense --

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.976
a sense that would give us seamless access

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.976
and easy access to meta-information
or information that may exist somewhere

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.976
that may be relevant to help us
make the right decision

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.840
about whatever it is
that we're coming across.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.976
And some of you may argue,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.262
"Well, don't today's cell phones
do that already?"

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:30.976
But I would say no.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
When you meet someone here at TED --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.039
and this is the top networking place,
of course, of the year --

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:38.921
you don't shake somebody's hand

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:40.976
and then say,
"Can you hold on for a moment

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.086
while I take out my phone and Google you?"

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.976
Or when you go to the supermarket

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.809
and you're standing there
in that huge aisle

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.349
of different types of toilet papers,

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:55.976
you don't take out your cell phone,
and open a browser,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.976
and go to a website to try to decide
which of these different toilet papers

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.060
is the most ecologically
responsible purchase to make.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:08.976
So we don't really have easy access
to all this relevant information

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.970
that can just help us
make optimal decisions

00:01:12.994 --> 00:01:16.147
about what to do next
and what actions to take.

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.976
And so my research group at the Media Lab

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.860
has been developing a series of inventions

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:28.461
to give us access to this information
in a sort of easy way,

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:33.457
without requiring that the user
changes any of their behavior.

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:37.976
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.976
and most successful effort so far,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.810
which is still very much
a work in process.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:47.976
I'm actually wearing the device right now
and we've sort of cobbled it together

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.658
with components that are off the shelf --

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:56.577
and that, by the way, only cost
350 dollars at this point in time.

00:01:56.602 --> 00:02:00.559
I'm wearing a camera,
just a simple web cam,

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:06.330
a portable, battery-powered
projection system with a little mirror.

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:10.425
These components communicate
to my cell phone in my pocket

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.730
which acts as the communication
and computation device.

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:18.674
And in the video here we see
my student Pranav Mistry,

00:02:18.698 --> 00:02:20.976
who's really the genius
who's been implementing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.367
and designing this whole system.

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:28.976
And we see how this system
lets him walk up to any surface

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.976
and start using his hands
to interact with the information

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.692
that is projected in front of him.

00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:39.814
The system tracks
the four significant fingers.

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:43.504
In this case, he's wearing
simple marker caps

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:44.976
that you may recognize.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.690
But if you want a more stylish version,

00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:51.391
you could also paint your nails
in different colors.

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:54.976
And the camera basically
tracks these four fingers

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.839
and recognizes any gestures
that he's making

00:02:58.863 --> 00:03:03.365
so he can just go to,
for example, a map of Long Beach,

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.627
zoom in and out, etc.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:11.745
The system also recognizes iconic gestures
such as the "take a picture" gesture,

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.187
and then takes a picture
of whatever is in front of you.

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.976
And when he then walks
back to the Media Lab,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.445
he can just go up to any wall

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.381
and project all the pictures
that he's taken,

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.976
sort through them and organize them,
and re-size them, etc.,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.824
again using all natural gestures.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:34.907
So, some of you most likely
were here two years ago

00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.185
and saw the demo by Jeff Han,
or some of you may think,

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.580
"Well, doesn't this look like
the Microsoft Surface Table?"

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:46.976
And yes, you also interact
using natural gestures,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.976
both hands, etc.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
But the difference here
is that you can use any surface,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.976
you can walk up to any surface,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.976
including your hand,
if nothing else is available,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.497
and interact with this projected data.

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:05.976
The device is completely
portable, and can be --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.740
(Applause)

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:13.381
(Applause ends)

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:16.976
So, one important difference
is that it's totally mobile.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.734
Another even more important
difference is that in mass production,

00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:25.423
this would not cost more tomorrow
than today's cell phones

00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:29.425
and would actually not
sort of be a bigger packaging --

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.471
could look a lot more stylish

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:34.593
than this version
that I'm wearing around my neck.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:40.879
But other than letting some of you
live out your fantasy

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:44.834
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise
in "Minority Report,"

00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:48.876
the reason why we're really
excited about this device

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.732
is that it really can act
as one of these sixth-sense devices

00:04:54.756 --> 00:05:00.008
that gives you relevant information
about whatever is in front of you.

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:03.976
So we see Pranav here
going into the supermarket

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.340
and he's shopping for some paper towels.

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:09.268
And, as he picks up a product,

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.346
the system can recognize
the product that he's picking up,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.606
using either image recognition
or marker technology,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.604
and give him the green light
or an orange light.

00:05:19.628 --> 00:05:22.538
He can ask for additional information.

00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:26.323
So this particular choice here

00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:29.976
is a particularly good choice,
given his personal criteria.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.976
Some of you may want the toilet paper
with the most bleach in it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.571
rather than the most ecologically
responsible choice.

00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:40.748
(Laughter)

00:05:40.772 --> 00:05:45.480
If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
he can get an Amazon rating --

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:48.116
it gets projected
right on the cover of the book.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.976
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.708
which gets a great rating,
by the way, at Amazon.

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:56.976
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.732
and can then see additional
information about the book --

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:06.976
reader comments, maybe sort of information
by his favorite critic, etc.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.976
If he turns to a particular page,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.293
he finds an annotation by maybe
an expert or a friend of ours

00:06:13.317 --> 00:06:16.139
that gives him a little bit
of additional information

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:19.188
about whatever is on that particular page.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:23.589
Reading the newspaper --
it never has to be outdated.

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:24.976
(Laughter)

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.789
You can get video annotations
of the events that you're reading about.

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:32.976
You can get the latest sports scores, etc.

00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:35.976
This is a more controversial one.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.651
(Laughter)

00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:39.976
As you interact with someone at TED,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.976
maybe you can see
a word cloud of the tags,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.728
the words that are associated
with that person

00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:49.500
in their blog and personal web pages.

00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:54.677
In this case, the student
is interested in cameras, etc.

00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:56.657
On your way to the airport,

00:06:56.681 --> 00:07:00.750
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can
tell you that your flight is delayed,

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.410
that the gate has changed, etc.

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:06.554
And, if you need to know
what the current time is,

00:07:06.578 --> 00:07:09.976
it's as simple as drawing a watch --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.205
(Laughter)

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.364
(Applause)

00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:13.976
on your arm.

00:07:15.614 --> 00:07:21.976
So that's where we're at so far
in developing this sixth sense

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.726
that would give us seamless access
to all this relevant information

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.568
about the things that we may come across.

00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:33.986
My student Pranav, who's really,
like I said, the genius behind this.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.262
(Applause and cheering)

00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:55.976
(Applause ends)

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.976
He does deserve a lot of applause,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.348
because I don't think he's slept much
in the last three months, actually.

00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:06.774
And his girlfriend is probably
not very happy about him either.

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:11.653
But it's not perfect yet,
it's very much a work in progress.

00:08:11.677 --> 00:08:14.610
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years

00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:18.976
we'll be here with the ultimate
sixth sense brain implant.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.047
Thank you.

00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:22.190
(Applause)
