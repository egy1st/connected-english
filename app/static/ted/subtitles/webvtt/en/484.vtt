WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Time flies.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's actually almost 20 years ago

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, 20 years on, at TED,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I want to ask your help in a new reframing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So going back to 1989,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as a sort of a play project,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And so he gave me the time to code it up.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
hypertext protocol, HTTP;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the idea of URLs, these names for things

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which started with HTTP.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I wrote the code and put it out there.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Why did I do it?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well, it was basically frustration.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in this huge, very exciting lab,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lots of people coming from all over the world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They had all sorts of different data formats,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So that, in all that diversity,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if I wanted to figure out how to build something

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
out of a bit of this and a bit of this,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I had to learn to run some new program,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And these were all incompatible.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It was just very frustrating.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So if you just imagined them all

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
say on the Internet,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
then life would be so much easier.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and even if people don't read your memo --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
(Laughter)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
what the web was like.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
a page which has got links,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Not impressive.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so, imagine that that link could have gone

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to virtually any document you could imagine.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Well, some people did.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And that is what has made it most fun.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That has been the most exciting thing,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
not the technology, not the things people have done with it,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but actually the community, the spirit of all these people

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
getting together, sending the emails.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's what it was like then.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And you did.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Thanks.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's been a blast, hasn't it?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I mean, it has been quite interesting

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because we've found out that the things that happen with the web

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
really sort of blow us away.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They're much more than we'd originally imagined

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
when we put together the little, initial website

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that we started off with.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
There is still a huge frustration

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, documents you read, OK?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
one of the great TED Talks.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Hans put up this presentation

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
he showed income levels on one axis

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which just shattered a lot of myths that people had

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
about the economics in the developing world.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
He put up a slide a little bit like this.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It had underground all the data

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Because data you can't naturally use by itself

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
In this case, Hans had put the data together

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
He had put it together,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and then he'd put it into this software,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which I think his son developed, originally,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and produces this wonderful presentation.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And Hans made a point

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I was happy to see that at the party last night

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So I want us now to think about

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and then calling that linked data.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
first thing is that those HTTP names --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
those things that start with "http:" --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we're using them not just for documents now,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
we're using them for things that the documents are about.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We're using them for people, we're using them for places,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
using the HTTP protocol from the web,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I will get back some data in a standard format

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
about that thing, about that event.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
where they were born, things like that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So the second rule is I get important information back.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Third rule is that when I get back that information

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
it's got relationships.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Data is relationships.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Interestingly, data is relationships.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
then the other thing that it's related to

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is given one of those names that starts HTTP.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and the population of it, and so on.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So I can browse this stuff.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So that's it, really.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
That is linked data.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and soon after that, things started to happen.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of these boxes that Hans had,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's not just a root supplying a plant,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but for each of those plants, whatever it is --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
they get to look at all the data

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and they get it connected together,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and the really important thing about data

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So, linked data.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The meme went out there.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
he noticed that Wikipedia --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And in most information boxes, there's data.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and put it into a blob of linked data

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
on the web, which he called dbpedia.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and if you actually go and look up Berlin,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you'll find that there are other blobs of data

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Let's think about data for a bit.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
there's scientific data, there's personal data,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
there's weather data, there's data about events,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I'm just going to mention a few of them

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
so that you also see how much unlocked potential.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Let's start with government data.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Barack Obama said in a speech,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in accessible formats.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
That's important. Why is it important?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It's actual useful. It's got value.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I can use it in my company.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
by making this data available.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in a government department, often you find that

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
these people, they're very tempted to keep it --

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Hans calls it database hugging.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
until you've made a beautiful website for it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
yes, make a beautiful website,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Make a beautiful website, but first

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
give us the unadulterated data,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
we want the data.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We want unadulterated data.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Can you say "raw"?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Audience: Raw.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Audience: Data.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
TBL: Can you say "now"?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Audience: Now!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"!

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Audience: Raw data now!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
people come up with to hang onto their data

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of the huge challenges that human society has right now --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
understanding how the world works.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
they have half-formed ideas in their head,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
they try to communicate those over the web.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
is on databases, often sitting in their computers,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and actually, currently not shared.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
In fact, I'll just go into one area --

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
because scientists in that field realize

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
this is a great way of getting out of those silos,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
because they had their genomics data in one database

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in one building, and they had their protein data in another.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I wouldn't ask -- they would.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What proteins are involved in signal transduction

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and also related to pyramidal neurons?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
because nobody has asked that question before.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You get 223,000 hits --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
no results you can use.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and you can look at.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
is really a complete sea change.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
It's very very important.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and has nothing to do with you.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
But, that's not true.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
In fact, data is about our lives.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Bing! Relationship. Data.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Every time you do things on the social networking site,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But, when you go to another linked data site --

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and let's say this is one about travel,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you can't get over the walls.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
tremendous frustration.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
between social networking sites.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We need to do that with linked data.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I did that. Me!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I did that to the map. I just did that!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and it creates an incredible resource

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
because everybody else does theirs.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And that is what linked data is all about.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
It's about people doing their bit

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
That's how linked data works.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but you know to demand it.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And we've practiced that.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, linked data -- it's huge.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I've only told you a very small number of things

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
There are data in every aspect of our lives,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
every aspect of work and pleasure,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
it's about connecting it together.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And when you connect data together, you get power

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
You get this really huge power out of it.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, we're at the stage now

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
even though there's not an immediate return on the investment

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
which would be good if everybody else did them.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
OK, so it's called linked data.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I want you to make it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I want you to demand it.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Thanks.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
(Applause)
