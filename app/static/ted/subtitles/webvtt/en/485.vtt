00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and usually what I’m talking about

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it is not requisite to know how to make it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who, by a strange inversion of reasoning,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
"Test Two:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You would have thought it stands to reason

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that design requires an intelligent designer.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We adore babies because they’re so cute.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So if you think first there was sweetness,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and then we evolved to like sweetness,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
then Mother Nature would have a problem:

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
How on earth do you get chimps to mate?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Just wire the chimps up to love that look,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and apparently they do.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
That’s all there is to it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
We became bald-bodied, oddly enough;

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
for one reason or another, they didn’t.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:27.000
If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
who did his famous experiments with gulls,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
if he made a bigger, oranger spot

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
What we see with, say, chocolate cake

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here’s a pretty good example.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So nature works on many levels here.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is the strange inversion.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is the hard one, the one that isn’t obvious. That’s why I leave it to the end.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I won’t be able to say too much about it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
for doing a grubby clerical job.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Our bumper sticker for this view is

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that this is the joy of debugging.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ...

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in this way, we can actually learn something

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
about the architecture of the brain,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
the functional architecture of the brain.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He’s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and we’re putting this together into a book.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Thank you very much.
