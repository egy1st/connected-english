00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk to you today a little bit

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about predictable irrationality.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And my interest in irrational behavior

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
started many years ago in the hospital.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was burned very badly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and you must have wondered what's the right approach.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which one of those is the right approach?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and they would grab hold and they would rip.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And as you can imagine,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I would try to reason with them and say,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
"Why don't we try something else?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Why don't we take it a little longer --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the nurses told me two things.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They told me that they had the right model of the patient --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to make suggestions or to interfere or ...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and they kept on doing what they were doing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And about three years later, when I left the hospital,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I started studying at the university.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
was that there is an experimental method

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
maybe learn something about the world.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So that's what I did.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I was still interested

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So originally I didn't have much money,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and I would crunch it a little bit.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
(Laughter)

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and pain that went up and pain that went down,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Or, if you had to choose between the last two,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
which one would you choose?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Laughter)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I kept on doing this for a while.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But at the end of this process,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Here were wonderful people with good intentions

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and plenty of experience, and nevertheless

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It turns out that because we don't encode duration

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in the way that we encode intensity,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and the intensity was lower.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
giving me a trend of improvement over time --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that would have been also less painful.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And it also turns out that it would have been good

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
All of these would have been great things to do,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and my nurses had no idea.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And from that point on I started thinking,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And it turns out it's a more general case --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
there's a lot of mistakes we do.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and I want to talk to you about cheating.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but also it tells us something, I think,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
about the stock market situation we're in.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So, my interest in cheating started

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I started thinking about what is happening here.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Is it the case that there was kind of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a few apples who are capable of doing these things,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or are we talking a more endemic situation,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And here's how it went.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but I wouldn't give you enough time.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on average people would solve four problems.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Other people I would tempt to cheat.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I would pass their sheet of paper.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
When the five minutes were over, I would say,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"Please shred the piece of paper.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and tell me how many questions you got correctly."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
People now solved seven questions on average.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
a few people cheated a lot.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Now, in economic theory,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You say, what's the probability of being caught?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you weigh these options out --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So, we try to test this.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
how much money they could steal.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
What about the probability of being caught?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
so there was some evidence left.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So we said, "If people are not sensitive

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
what could be going on?"

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and still feel good about ourselves.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So, maybe what is happening is that

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
there's a level of cheating we can't go over,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We call this like a personal fudge factor.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So, we got people to the lab, and we said,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
"We have two tasks for you today."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
First, we asked half the people

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to recall either 10 books they read in high school,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
or to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and then we tempted them with cheating.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It wasn't that the more religious people --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and the less religious people --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
cheated more.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
they stopped cheating.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
they don't cheat at all.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to bring into the education system, so we said,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So, we got people to sign,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And this is particularly interesting,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
because MIT doesn't have an honor code.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
(Laughter)

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
What about increasing the fudge factor?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And I came back to measure what we technically call

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
No bill ever disappeared.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Now, this is not a good social science experiment,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
so to do it better I did the same experiment

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
as I described to you before.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
they came to us and said,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
they came to us and said,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and exchanged it for dollars.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Think about the following intuition.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
compared to how bad would you feel

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
These things feel very differently.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
by being paid by token make a difference?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Our subjects doubled their cheating.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'll tell you what I think

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
about this and the stock market in a minute.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
because in Enron, there's also a social element.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
People see each other behaving.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
In fact, every day when we open the news

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
we see examples of people cheating.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
What does this cause us?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So, we did another experiment.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and we prepaid them.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and we told them that at the end, we asked them

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The same thing happens.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
"I solved everything. What do I do now?"

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
That's it. The task is finished."

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So, now we had a student -- an acting student --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that was a part of the group.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Nobody knew it was an actor.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
What would happen to the other people in the group?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Here is what happens.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Here is the thing.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
were Carnegie Mellon students.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
cheating went down.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Laughter)

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Now, this is important, because remember,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
when the moment the student stood up,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
because the experimenter said,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It was about the norms for cheating.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I mean, not terrible in this --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
from another university, another group,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and people cheat even less.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
They cheat just by a little bit.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
When we get bigger distance from cheating,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And when we see cheating around us,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
think about what happens.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What happens in a situation when you create something

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
where you pay people a lot of money

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to see reality in a slightly distorted way?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Would they not be able to see it this way?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Of course they would.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
What happens when you do other things,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
like you remove things from money?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
mortgage-backed securities.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Could it be that with those more distant things,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
it's not a token for one second,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
it's something that is many steps removed from money

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And what happens to the social environment

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
when people see other people behave around them?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in the stock market.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
More generally, I want to tell you something

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
about behavioral economics.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We have many intuitions in our life,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
in our private life, in our business life,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and most particularly when it goes to policy,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
taxation, health care and so on.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And the difficulty of testing our intuition

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
was the big lesson I learned

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So I went back to talk to them

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And I learned two interesting things.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But think about me as a nurse,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
"I did not think that your intuition was right.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I felt my intuition was correct."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So, if you think about all of your intuitions,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
she thought her intuition was right --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to try and check whether she was wrong.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
our own ability, how the economy works,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
how we should pay school teachers.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
But unless we start testing those intuitions,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
we're not going to do better.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And just think about how better my life would have been

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and how everything would have been better

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Thank you very much.
