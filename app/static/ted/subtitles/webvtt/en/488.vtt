00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
About four years ago, the New Yorker published an article

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about a cache of dodo bones that was found

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in a pit on the island of Mauritius.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
off the east coast of Madagascar

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where the dodo bird was discovered

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and extinguished, all within about 150 years.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because it meant that they might finally be able

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to assemble a single dodo skeleton.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
See, while museums all over the world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
not even the actual Natural History Museum

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from the bones of a single dodo.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, this isn't exactly true.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The fact is, is that the British Museum

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
up until the 18th century --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it was actually mummified, skin and all --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but in a fit of space-saving zeal,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and they burned the rest in a bonfire.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you go look at their website today,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they'll actually list these specimens, saying,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the rest was lost in a fire.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Not quite the whole truth. Anyway.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The frontispiece of this article was this photo,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
because this photo completely rocked my world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I became obsessed with the object --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
not just the beautiful photograph itself,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the wire you can see on the beak there

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that the conservator used to put this skeleton together --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
there's an entire story here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I thought to myself,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
wouldn't it be great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if I had my own dodo skeleton?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I want to point out here at this point that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I've spent my life obsessed

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
by objects and the stories that they tell,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and this was the very latest one.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I began looking around for --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to see if anyone sold a kit,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
some kind of model that I could get,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
into my "Creative Projects" folder --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Any time I have an internet connection,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
there's a sluice of stuff moving into there,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to celebrate the storming of the Bastille.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Russian nuclear launch key:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This folder has 17,000 photos --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
over 20 gigabytes of information --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and it's growing constantly.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
maybe,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm a hard-edged model maker.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
especially parts from "Star Wars" --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I can do this stuff all day long.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But you give me something like this --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
this is not my thing --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
this is something other people do -- dragons, soft things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to actually be able to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
understand the topology and perhaps replicate it --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I mean, it couldn't be that difficult.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So, I started looking at the best photos I could find.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I grabbed all the reference,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and I found this lovely piece of reference.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This is someone selling this on eBay;

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it was clearly a womanâ€™s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
exactly how long, etc.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I just noticed that as I finished this skull,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I actually understood the mechanics

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And so button by button,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
vertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
with a ruler.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
replicated every last bone and put it in.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And after about six weeks,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I finished, painted, mounted

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
my own dodo skeleton.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You can see that I even made a museum label for it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that includes a brief history of the dodo.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
a museum vitrine.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I don't have the room for this in my house,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but I had to finish what I had started.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Again, like I said, my life has been about

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and also making them for myself, obtaining them,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
appreciating them and diving into them.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And in this folder, "Creative Projects,"

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and things that I may just want to find and buy and have

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and look at and touch.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But now there was potentially this new category of things

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that I could sculpt

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that was different, that I -- you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I have my own R2D2, but that's --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now, this is funny for me:

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But in this case,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
it's about the object in and of itself.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And in this case, this object is --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
plays on a host of levels.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
First of all, there's the object in the world.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
made around 1700 for a Swedish Count,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and it is very likely the object from which

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Built out of words, it is the engine

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that drives the plot of his book and also the movie,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in which another object is created:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then there is this fourth level, which is

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
a whole new object in the world:

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
becomes, in its own right,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
a whole other thing,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a whole new object of desire.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And so now it was time to do some research.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I actually had done some research

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and had downloaded enough pictures to actually

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
have some reasonable reference.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But I discovered,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in researching further,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
really wanting precise reference, that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
one of the original lead birds

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
had been sold at Christie's in 1994,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
who had the original Christie's catalogue,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and in it I found this magnificent picture,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
which included a size reference.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
a New Jersey editor, actually found this

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
resin Maltese Falcon

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
at a flea market in 1991,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
although it took him five years

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to authenticate this bird to

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the auctioneers' specifications,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
because there was a lot of controversy about it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
about the time the movie was made.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
because I can see it compared to this thing,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
not just a front elevation, but also

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
a side, rear

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and other side elevation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So now, I had all the topology I needed

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to replicate the Maltese Falcon.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I blew all my reference up to full size,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and then I began cutting out the negatives and using

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
those templates as shape references.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I worked out and achieved --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
here's me sitting next to my wife --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it's the only picture I took of the entire process.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
As I moved through, I achieved

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But again, I am not a sculptor,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I certainly wasn't able to get it.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So, I went down to my shop,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and I molded it and I cast it in resin,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
My preference is about 70 coats of this --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
matte black auto primer.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and I can get it glass-smooth.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So I was able to actually

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
at this point in time, when I'd finished it,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
this is by far the most accurate

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
representation of the original Maltese Falcon

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is where it gets weird.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of the Black Dahlia.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, James Ellroy believes

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
killed James Elroy's mother.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon --

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
it was a publicity stunt for the movie.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
John's Grill, which actually

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
is seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
is still a viable San Francisco eatery,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and he gave them

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
until it got stolen

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
in January of 2007.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It would seem that the object of desire

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So here I had this Falcon,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and it was lovely. It looked really great,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
the light worked on it really well,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
it was better than anything that I could achieve

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
or obtain out in the world.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But there was a problem. And the problem was that:

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I wanted the entirety of the object,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I wanted the weight behind the object.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This thing was made of resin and it was too light.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There's this group online that I frequent.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's a group of prop crazies just like me

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
make and travel in information about movie props.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And it turned out that one of the guys there,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
a friend of mine that I never actually met,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He took my master Falcon pattern,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
he actually did lost wax casting

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in bronze for me,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and this is the bronze I got back.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Here, I'm going to put it out there,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
later on tonight, and

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I want you to pick it up and handle it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You want to know

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
how obsessed I am. This project's only for me,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
like it is in the movie.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
(Laughter)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Yeah, I know!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But there's a problem.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
there's my master and there's my bronze.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
why didn't I remember this?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
which I have already done,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
going from a wax master to a bronze master

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and blown this up big enough to make

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a 3D lithography master of this,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and then I will have it done in bronze. Or:

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There are several people who own originals,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I'll give them one if they want it.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Thank you.
