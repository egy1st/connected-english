00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.381
I'm going to present
three projects in rapid fire.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:05.976
I don't have much time to do it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.334
And I want to reinforce three ideas
with that rapid-fire presentation.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:12.334
The first is what I like to call
a hyper-rational process.

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:16.255
It's a process that takes rationality
almost to an absurd level,

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.184
and it transcends all the baggage

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.852
that normally comes
with what people would call,

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.976
sort of a rational
conclusion to something.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.286
And it concludes in something
that you see here,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.091
that you actually wouldn't expect
as being the result of rationality.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.766
The second --

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.780
the second is that this process
does not have a signature.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.180
There is no authorship.

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:41.216
Architects are obsessed with authorship.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.724
This is something that has
editing and it has teams,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:46.111
but in fact, we no longer
see within this process,

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.665
the traditional master architect

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:50.405
creating a sketch
that his minions carry out.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.575
And the third is that it challenges --

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.976
and this is, in the length of this,
very hard to support why,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.302
connect all these things --

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:01.529
but it challenges the high modernist
notion of flexibility.

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:05.193
High modernists said we will create
sort of singular spaces that are generic,

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:07.106
almost anything can happen within them.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.156
I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" --

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.341
turn your head this way; shoot;
and you're bound to kill something.

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:14.440
So, this is the promise of high modernism:

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:17.687
within a single space, actually,
any kind of activity can happen.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.976
But as we're seeing,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.976
operational costs are starting
to dwarf capital costs

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.039
in terms of design parameters.

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:26.783
And so, with this sort of idea,

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:30.065
what happens is, whatever actually
is in the building on opening day,

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.352
or whatever seems to be
the most immediate need,

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:35.648
starts to dwarf the possibility
and sort of subsume it,

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.600
of anything else could ever happen.

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:40.221
And so we're proposing
a different kind of flexibility,

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.379
something that we call
"compartmentalized flexibility."

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.742
And the idea is that you,
within that continuum,

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.894
identify a series of points,
and you design specifically to them.

00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.935
They can be pushed
off-center a little bit,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.072
but in the end you actually
still get as much

00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:56.976
of that original spectrum
as you originally had hoped.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
With high modernist flexibility,
that doesn't really work.

00:02:00.463 --> 00:02:01.905
Now I'm going to talk about --

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.238
I'm going to build up
the Seattle Central Library

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:07.043
in this way before your eyes
in about five or six diagrams,

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.884
and I truly mean this is the design
process that you'll see.

00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:12.212
With the library staff
and the library board,

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:13.976
we settled on two core positions.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.445
This is the first one, and this
is showing, over the last 900 years,

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.088
the evolution of the book,
and other technologies.

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:23.976
This diagram was our sort
of position piece about the book,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.516
and our position was,
books are technology --

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.128
that's something people forget --

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:31.314
but it's a form of technology
that will have to share its dominance

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:34.757
with any other form of truly potent
technology or media.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.282
The second premise --

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:38.797
and this was something
that was very difficult for us

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:40.787
to convince the librarians of at first --

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:44.594
is that libraries, since the inception
of Carnegie Library tradition in America,

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.501
had a second responsibility,
and that was for social roles.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.113
Ok, now, this I'll come back
to later, but something --

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.344
actually, the librarians at first said,
"No, this isn't our mandate.

00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:56.074
Our mandate is media,
and particularly the book."

00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:00.533
So what you're seeing now
is actually the design of the building.

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:03.009
The upper diagram is what we had seen

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.574
in a whole host of contemporary libraries
that used high modernist flexibility.

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:10.000
Sort of, any activity
could happen anywhere.

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.381
We don't know the future of the library;
we don't know the future of the book;

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:15.984
and so, we'll use this approach.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.188
And what we saw were buildings
that were very generic, and worse --

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:20.910
not only were they very generic --

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.676
so, not only does the reading room
look like the copy room

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.198
look like the magazine area --

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:28.948
but it meant that whatever issue
was troubling the library at that moment

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:32.487
was starting to engulf every other
activity that was happening in it.

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.760
And in this case,
what was getting engulfed

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:37.800
were these social responsibilities
by the expansion of the book.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.039
And so we proposed
what's at the lower diagram.

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:43.150
Very dumb approach:
simply compartmentalize.

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:45.627
Put those things whose evolution
we could predict --

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:49.234
and I don't mean that we could say
what would actually happen in the future,

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:53.144
but we have some certainty of the spectrum
of what would happen in the future --

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:55.418
put those in boxes designed
specifically for it,

00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:58.136
and put the things that we can't
predict on the rooftops.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.407
So that was the core idea.

00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:01.125
Now, we had to convince the library

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.815
that social roles were
equally important to media,

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.618
in order to get them to accept this.

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:09.642
What you're seeing here is actually
their program on the left.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.703
That's as it was given to us
in all of its clarity and glory.

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:18.015
Our first operation was to re-digest it
back to them, show it to them and say,

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.976
"You know what? We haven't touched it,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.387
but only one-third of your own program
is dedicated to media and books.

00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.360
Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --

00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:28.495
that's the white band below,
the thing you said isn't important --

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.528
is already dedicated to social functions."

00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:32.733
So once we had presented
that back to them,

00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:35.328
they agreed that this sort
of core concept could work.

00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:37.706
We got the right to go back
to first principles --

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.940
that's the third diagram.

00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:40.170
We recombined everything.

00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:42.152
And then we started making new decisions.

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:45.049
What you're seeing on the right
is the design of the library,

00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:46.994
specifically in terms of square footage.

00:04:47.018 --> 00:04:51.976
On the left of that diagram, here,
you'll see a series of five platforms --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.976
sort of combs, collective programs.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.405
And on the right are the more
indeterminate spaces;

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.680
things like reading rooms,

00:04:57.704 --> 00:05:00.389
whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years
we can't predict.

00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:02.722
So that literally was the design
of the building.

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:04.881
They signed it, and to their chagrin,

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.976
we came back a week later,
and we presented them this.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.897
And as you can see, it is literally
the diagram on the right.

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:11.922
(Laughter)

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.376
We just sized -- no, really,
I mean that, literally.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.762
The things on the left-hand side
of the diagram,

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:17.976
those are the boxes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.929
We sized them into five compartments.
They're super-efficient.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.825
We had a very low budget to work with.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.429
We pushed them around on the site

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:26.666
to make very literal
contextual relationships.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.003
The reading room
should be able to see the water.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:31.808
The main entrance should have
a public plaza in front of it

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.953
to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.

00:05:34.397 --> 00:05:36.850
So, you see the five platforms,
those are the boxes.

00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:39.303
within each one, a very discrete
thing is happening.

00:05:39.327 --> 00:05:41.674
The area in between
is sort of an urban continuum,

00:05:41.698 --> 00:05:45.048
these things that we can't predict
their evolution to the same degree.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.976
To give you some sense
of the power of this idea,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.976
the biggest block
is what we call the book spiral.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.334
It's literally built
in a very inexpensive way --

00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:55.976
it is a parking garage for books.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.487
It just so happens to be on the 6th
through 10th floors of the building,

00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.786
but that is not necessarily
an expensive approach.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.636
And it allows us to organize
the entire Dewey Decimal System

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.531
on one continuous run; no matter how it
grows or contracts within the building,

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:13.976
it will always have its clarity
to end the sort of trail of tears

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.729
that we've all experienced
in public libraries.

00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:17.976
(Laughter)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.731
And so this was the final operation,

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.876
which was to take these blocks
as they were all pushed off kilter,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.976
and to hold onto them with a skin.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.976
That skin serves double duty,
again, for economics.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.976
One, it is the lateral stability
for the entire building;

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.262
it's a structural element.

00:06:32.286 --> 00:06:34.913
But its dimensions were designed
not only for structure,

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:37.188
but also for holding on
every piece of glass.

00:06:37.212 --> 00:06:39.976
The glass was then --
I'll use the word impregnated --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.412
but it had a layer of metal
that was called "stretched metal."

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.274
That metal acts as a microlouver,

00:06:45.298 --> 00:06:48.679
so from the exterior of the building,
the sun sees it as totally opaque,

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:51.377
but from the interior,
it's entirely transparent.

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.148
So now I'm going to take you
on a tour of the building.

00:06:54.871 --> 00:06:56.245
Let me see if I can find it.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:59.538
For anyone who gets
motion sickness, I apologize.

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:01.661
So, this is the building.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:07.886
And I think what's important is,
when we first unveiled the building,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.976
the public saw it as being
totally about our whim and ego.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.842
And it was defended,
believe it or not, by the librarians.

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:16.890
They said, "Look,
we don't know what it is,

00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:19.279
but we know it's everything
that we need it to be,

00:07:19.303 --> 00:07:22.439
based on the observations
that we've done about the program."

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:27.069
This is going into one of the entries.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:30.454
So, it's an unusual building
for a public library, obviously.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.601
So now we're going
into what we call the living room.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.497
This is actually a program
that we invented with the library.

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.438
It was recognizing that public libraries

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.247
are the last vestige of public free space.

00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:48.699
There are plenty of shopping malls
that allow you to get out of the rain

00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:49.879
in downtown Seattle,

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:52.830
but there are not so many free places

00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:54.675
that allow you to get out of the rain.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.285
So this was an unprogrammed area where
people could pretty much do anything,

00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:00.418
including eat, yell,
play chess and so forth.

00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:04.448
Now we're moving up into what we call
the mixing chamber.

00:08:04.472 --> 00:08:07.400
That was the main
technology area in the building.

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:10.000
You'll have to tell me
if I'm going too fast for you.

00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:15.351
And now up.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.195
This is actually the place
that we put into the building

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:25.252
so I could propose
to my wife, right there.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.395
(Laughter)

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.159
She said yes.

00:08:29.183 --> 00:08:31.183
(Laughter)

00:08:32.593 --> 00:08:35.174
I'm running out of time,
so I'm actually going to stop.

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:36.976
I can show this to you later.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.283
But let's see if I can very quickly
get into the book spiral,

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:42.371
because I think it's,
as I said, the most --

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:45.712
this is the main reading room --
the most unique part of the building.

00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:47.934
You dizzy yet?

00:08:49.141 --> 00:08:50.966
Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.

00:08:56.395 --> 00:08:58.328
So, it's very indiscernible,

00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:01.853
but it's actually
a continuous stair-stepping.

00:09:01.877 --> 00:09:03.869
It allows you to, on one city block,

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:06.588
go up one full floor,
so that it's on a continuum.

00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:14.976
Ok, now I'm going to go back,
and I'm going to hit a second project.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.263
I'm going to go very,
very quickly through this.

00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:18.967
Now this is the Dallas Theater.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.339
It was an unusual client for us,
because they came to us and they said,

00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:24.069
"We need you to do a new building.

00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:27.519
We've been working
in a temporary space for 30 years,

00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:29.266
but because of that temporary space,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.153
we've become an infamous theater company.

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:35.138
Theater is really focused in New York,
Chicago and Seattle,

00:09:35.162 --> 00:09:38.259
with the exception
of the Dallas Theater Company."

00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:40.979
And the very fact that they worked
in a provisional space

00:09:41.003 --> 00:09:43.446
meant that for Beckett,
they could blow out a wall;

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.212
they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow
a hole through the floor, and so forth.

00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:50.268
So it was a very daunting task
for us to do a brand-new building

00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:52.346
that could be a pristine building,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.389
but keep this kind of experimental nature.

00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:55.611
And the second is,

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:58.513
they were what we call
a multi-form theater,

00:09:58.537 --> 00:10:01.143
they do different kinds
of performances in repertory.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.976
So they in the morning
will do something in arena,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.493
then they'll do something
in proscenium and so forth.

00:10:06.517 --> 00:10:08.866
And so they needed to be able
to quickly transform

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.816
between different theater organizations,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.525
and for operational budget reasons,

00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:14.712
this actually no longer
happens in pretty much

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:16.976
any multi-form theater
in the United States,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.475
so we needed to figure out
a way to overcome that.

00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:22.322
So our thought was to literally
put the theater on its head:

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:24.656
to take those things
that were previously defined

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.355
as front-of-house and back-of-house

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:28.387
and stack them above house
and below house,

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.610
and to create what we called
a theater machine.

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:33.117
We invest the money
in the operation of the building.

00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:35.963
It's almost as though the building
could be placed anywhere,

00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:37.139
wherever you place it,

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:39.893
the area under it is charged
for theatrical performances.

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:42.239
And it allowed us to go back
to first principles,

00:10:42.263 --> 00:10:45.845
and redefine fly tower, acoustic
enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.

00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:47.339
And at the push of a button,

00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:50.990
it allows the artistic director
to move between proscenium, thrust,

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:54.805
and in fact, arena
and traverse and flat floor,

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:57.224
in a very quick transfiguration.

00:10:57.248 --> 00:11:00.670
So in fact, using
operational budget, we can --

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:02.886
sorry, capital cost --
we can actually achieve

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.381
what was no longer achievable
in operational cost.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.851
And that means that the artistic director

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.240
now has a palette that he or she
can choose from,

00:11:10.264 --> 00:11:13.762
between a series of forms
and a series of processions,

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:16.910
because that enclosure around the theater
that is normally trapped

00:11:16.934 --> 00:11:19.976
with front-of-house and back-of-house
spaces has been liberated.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.269
So an artistic director has the ability
to have a performance

00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:25.408
that enters in a Wagnerian procession,

00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:27.767
shows the first act in thrust,

00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:30.976
the intermission in a Greek procession,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.818
second act in arena, and so forth.

00:11:33.254 --> 00:11:35.605
So I'm going to show you
what this actually means.

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:37.397
This is the theater up close.

00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:40.507
Any portion around the theater
actually can be opened discretely.

00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:46.413
The light enclosure can be lifted
separate to the acoustic enclosure,

00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:48.921
so you can do Beckett
with Dallas as the backdrop.

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:51.311
Portions can be opened,

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:54.978
so you can now actually have motorcycles
drive directly into the performance,

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:57.404
or you can even just have
an open-air performance,

00:11:57.428 --> 00:11:58.594
or for intermissions.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.827
The balconies all move to go
between those configurations,

00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:03.136
but they also disappear.

00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.637
The proscenium line can also disappear.

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:07.970
You can bring enormous objects in,

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.985
so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:12.660
their first show will be a play
about Charles Lindbergh,

00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:14.976
and they'll want to bring in
a real aircraft.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.611
And then it also provides them,
in the off-season,

00:12:17.635 --> 00:12:22.841
the ability to actually rent out
their space for entirely different things.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.655
This is it from a distance.

00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:31.909
Open up entire portions
for different kinds of events.

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:33.084
And at night.

00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:38.970
Again, remove the light enclosure;
keep the acoustic enclosure.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.554
This is a monster truck show.

00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:43.469
I'm going to show now the last project.

00:12:43.493 --> 00:12:44.976
This also is an unusual client.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.473
They inverted the whole idea
of development.

00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:50.324
They came to us and they said --
unlike normal developers --

00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:51.885
they said, "We want to start out

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:54.658
by providing a contemporary
art museum in Louisville.

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:55.886
That's our main goal."

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.505
And so instead of being a developer
that sees an opportunity to make money,

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.550
they saw an ability to be
a catalyst in their downtown.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:06.154
And the fact that they wanted to support
the contemporary art museum

00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:07.735
actually built their pro forma,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:09.076
so they worked in reverse.

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.976
And that pro forma led us

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.976
to a mixed-use building
that was very large,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.304
in order to support
their aspirations of the art,

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.875
but it also opened up opportunities
for the art itself

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.119
to collaborate, interact
with commercial spaces

00:13:21.143 --> 00:13:23.903
that actually artists more
and more want to work within.

00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:27.381
And it also charged us
with thinking about how to have

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:29.369
something that was both a single building

00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.976
and a credible sort of sub-building.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.543
So this is Louisville's skyline,

00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:37.247
and I'm going to take
you through the various constraints

00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:38.464
that led to the project.

00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:40.027
First: the physical constraints.

00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:42.452
We actually had to operate
on three discrete sites,

00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:45.357
all of them well smaller
than the size of the building.

00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:49.064
We had to operate next to the new
Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.

00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:51.386
We had to operate
within the 100-year floodplain.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.725
Now, this area floods
three to four times a year,

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.486
and there's a levee behind our site,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.790
similar to the ones
that broke in New Orleans.

00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:02.889
Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,

00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:05.829
a street that cuts through the middle
of these separate sites.

00:14:05.853 --> 00:14:10.419
So we're starting to build a sort of
nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.

00:14:10.443 --> 00:14:13.832
Underneath the bathtub
are the city's main power lines.

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:17.500
And there is a pedestrian corridor
that they wanted to add,

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.474
that would link a series
of cultural buildings,

00:14:20.498 --> 00:14:23.464
and a view corridor --
because this is the historic district --

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.036
that they didn't want to obstruct
with a new building.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.100
(Laughter)

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.697
And now we're going to add
1.1 million square feet.

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:33.340
And if we did the traditional thing,
that 1.1 million square feet --

00:14:33.364 --> 00:14:35.036
these are the different programs --

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.024
the traditional thing would be to identify
the public elements, place them on sites,

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:41.223
and now we'd have a really
terrible situation:

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.976
a public thing in the middle
of a bathtub that floods.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.597
And then we would size
all the other elements --

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.276
the different commercial elements:

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.443
hotel, luxury housing,
offices and so forth --

00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:52.672
and dump it on top.

00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:55.660
And we would create
something that was unviable.

00:14:55.684 --> 00:14:59.429
In fact -- and you know this -- this
is called the Time Warner Building.

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:01.127
(Laughter)

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:02.976
So our strategy was very simple.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.111
Just lift the entire block,

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:07.770
flip some of the elements over,

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:10.604
reposition them
so they have appropriate views

00:15:10.628 --> 00:15:12.264
and relationships to downtown,

00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:15.741
and make circulation connections
and reroute the road.

00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:17.292
So that's the basic concept,

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.646
and now I'm going to show you
what it leads to.

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:23.471
Ok, it seems a very formal,
willful gesture,

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:26.043
but something derived entirely
out of the constraints.

00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:29.048
And again, when we unveiled it,
there was a sort of nervousness

00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:31.509
that this was about an architect
making a statement,

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:35.125
not an architect who was attempting
to solve a series of problems.

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:37.443
Now, within that center zone, as I said,

00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:39.622
we have the ability to mix
a series of things.

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:42.369
So here, this is sort of an x-ray --

00:15:42.393 --> 00:15:44.328
the towers are totally developer-driven.

00:15:44.352 --> 00:15:46.802
They told us the dimensions,
the sizes and so forth,

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:49.323
and we focused on taking
all the public components --

00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:50.639
the lobbies, the bars --

00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:53.976
everything that different commercial
elements would have,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.976
and combined it in the center,
in the sort of subway map,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.718
in the transfer zone that would also
include the contemporary art museum.

00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:04.807
So it creates a situation like this,
where you have artists who can operate

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:08.709
within an art space that also has
an amazing view on the 22nd floor,

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:12.190
but it also has proximity that the curator
can either open or close.

00:16:12.214 --> 00:16:15.420
It allows people
on exercise bicycles to be seen,

00:16:15.444 --> 00:16:17.119
or to see the art, and so forth.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.863
It also means that if an artist wants
to invade something like a swimming pool,

00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:23.597
they can begin to do their exhibition
in a swimming pool,

00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:26.258
so they're not forced to always
work within the confines

00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:27.817
of a contemporary gallery space.

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:29.008
So, how to build this.

00:16:29.032 --> 00:16:30.976
It's very simple: it's a chair.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.432
So, we begin by building the cores.

00:16:34.456 --> 00:16:38.000
As we're building the cores, we build
the contemporary art museum at grade.

00:16:38.024 --> 00:16:41.090
That allows us to have
incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.

00:16:41.114 --> 00:16:42.815
This is not a high-budget building.

00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:44.688
The moment the cores get to mid level,

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:47.907
we finish the art museum; we put
all the mechanical equipment in it;

00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:49.676
and then we jack it up into the air.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.189
This is how they build
really large aircraft hangars,

00:16:52.213 --> 00:16:54.573
for instance, the ones
that they did for the A380.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.437
Finish the cores, finish the meat

00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:58.474
and you get something
that looks like this.

00:16:58.498 --> 00:17:00.076
Now I only have about 30 seconds,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.998
so I want to start an animation,

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:03.417
and we'll conclude with that.

00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:04.829
Thank you.

00:17:04.853 --> 00:17:08.976
(Applause)

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.976
Chris asked me to add --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.776
