00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My doctors told me that my lung capacity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
had gone down to 70 percent,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and it was killing me.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With the help of IIT,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
TERI, and learnings from NASA,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we discovered that there are three

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
basic green plants,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
common green plants, with which

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we can grow all the fresh air

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we need indoors to keep us healthy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've also found that you can

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
reduce the fresh air requirements

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
into the building, while maintaining

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
industry indoor air-quality standards.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The three plants are Areca palm,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The botanical names are in front of you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Areca palm is a plant which

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We need four shoulder-high plants per person,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and in terms of plant care,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we need to wipe the leaves

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
every day in Delhi, and perhaps

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
once a week in cleaner-air cities.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We had to grow them in vermi manure,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is sterile, or hydroponics,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and take them outdoors every three to four months.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is again a very common plant,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we call it a bedroom plant,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The third plant is money plant,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and this is again a very common plant;

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
preferably grows in hydroponics.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and other volatile chemicals.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
With these three plants,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you can grow all the fresh air you need.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In fact, you could be in a bottle

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and you would not need any fresh air.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We have tried these plants at our

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
own building in Delhi, which is a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Our studies have found that there is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
going up by one percent if one stays indoors

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in this building for 10 hours.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The government of India has discovered

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or published a study to show

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And the study showed that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
compared to other buildings,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
there is a reduced incidence of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
eye irritation by 52 percent,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
respiratory systems by 34 percent,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
headaches by 24 percent,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And this study has been published on September 8, 2008,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and it's available on the government of India website.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Our experience points to an

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
amazing increase in human productivity

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
by over 20 percent by using these plants.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We are now replicating this in a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
1.75-million-square-feet building,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Why is this important?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It is also important for the environment,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
because the world's energy

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
requirements are expected to grow

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
by 30 percent in the next decade.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
40 percent of the world's energy is taken

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
up by buildings currently,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and 60 percent of the world's population

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
will be living in buildings in cities

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And there is a growing preference for living

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and working in air-conditioned places.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
"Be the change you want to see in the world,"

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
said Mahatma Gandhi.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And thank you for listening.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Applause)
