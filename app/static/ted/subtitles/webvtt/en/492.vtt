00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you're at all like me,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
capable of more than 30 knots.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it can do amazing things.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And one day, a vessel not unlike this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
will probably break the world speed record.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But kites aren't just toys like this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and tell you about the magnificent future

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of every child's favorite plaything.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, kites are more than a thousand years old,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the Chinese used them for military applications,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and even for lifting men.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
all of the great inventors of the time --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
like Hargreaves, like Langley,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then these two fellows came along,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and they were flying kites to develop the control systems

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that would ultimately enable powered human flight.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and the Wright Flyer.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And their experiments with kites led to this

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
first-ever 12-second human flight.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in the Journal of Energy

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to generate enormous amounts of electricity.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The real key observation he made is that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but they can't really go a lot higher,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as much as twice as much.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
where we don't have a technology as yet to get there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm now going to show you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the first autonomous generation of power

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
by every child's favorite plaything.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It makes you a little nauseous.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
so, enough to power probably five United States households --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
with a kite not much larger than this piano.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And the real significant thing here

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is we're developing the control systems,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that's tracing your name in the sky.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And this is where we're actually going.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So we're beyond the 12-second steps.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So you ask, how big are those machines?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That would be enough to power your cell phone.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which is more than the largest wind turbines today.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So that is audacious, you say. I agree.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This is a refrigerator factory,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
churning out airplanes for World War II.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
By 1945, they were making 100,000.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with these dreams. There are many of us.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I think we need to support all of the dreams

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of the kids out there doing these crazy things.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Thank you.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
(Applause)
