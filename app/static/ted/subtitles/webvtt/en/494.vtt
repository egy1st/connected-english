00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So often, we look at dollar terms --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
income as only one variable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Because really, it's a condition about choice,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the lack of freedom.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the understanding that I have.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in the Mathare Valley slums.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's about three miles out of Nairobi,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
where over half a million people

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
live crammed in these little tin shacks,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
generation after generation, renting them,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
often eight or 10 people to a room.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a hard place to grow up.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it was literally impossible not to step in the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But at the same time it was also

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
impossible not to see the human vitality,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I met this woman, Mama Rose,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
where she lives with her seven children.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Four sleep in one twin bed,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It was also the day after the inauguration,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I would see kids on the street corners,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And it was here that I met Jane.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and I asked her to tell me her story.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
My first dream was to be a doctor,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the second was to marry a good man

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who would stay with me and my family,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because my mother was a single mom,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
or sometimes with nothing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the embarrassment of it all."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In 2001, her life changed.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
She started tailoring.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And that turned into what she does now,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Some of them might be ones you gave.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
all along the economic spectrum.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and also the jewelry that she makes,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And so she can't move out.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
She lives with all of that insecurity,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in which she would live.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Jamii Bora understands that and understands

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that when we're talking about poverty,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
loans and investments that will go the long term with them,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
they built a low-cost housing development,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
about an hour outside Nairobi central.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And they designed it from the perspective of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
customers like Jane herself,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
insisting on responsibility and accountability.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
among the first 200 families to move into this development.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
When I asked her if she feared anything,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
she said, "What would I fear

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that I haven't confronted already?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And she said, "What would I miss?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
my bags would be packed."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And she said, "Well, you know,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but what I really wanted was a family

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but what I really wanted to be was somebody

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
who served and healed and cured.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But maybe me, I give out something better

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
because I give them hope."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And in the middle of this economic crisis,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
where so many of us are inclined to pull in

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
with fear, I think we're well suited to

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
take a cue from Jane and reach out,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Because when systems are broken,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
like the ones that we're seeing around the world,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's an opportunity to truly build a world

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
where we can extend services and products

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to all human beings, so that they can

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
make decisions and choices for themselves.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We owe it to the Janes of the world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Thank you.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(Applause)
