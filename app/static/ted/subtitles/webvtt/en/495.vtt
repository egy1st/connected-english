00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I review gadgets and stuff.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What I'm mostly doing this year

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is going on cable TV and answering the same question:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"What are the tech trends for next year?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Anyway, this all started a few years ago,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we've come a long way since that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, it works just like a regular phone.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It could be anything. It could be salsa music

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or a comedy routine -- it doesn't matter.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The little box has your phone number.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because it's got everything in the box.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They've got every feature known to man in there,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because adding a new feature is just software.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And as a result of Voice Over IP --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
VOIP service in the world: It's Skype.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's not your phone -- it's your computer.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like me, try out Skype for the first time,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They don't want to pay the international fees,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's really cute.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But I -- at least it was when I did it --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is when they start putting it on cell phones.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and any time you were in a wireless hotspot --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
free calls anywhere in the world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
never pay the cellular company a nickel.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It'd be really, really cool -- and yet,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
even though the technology for this has been available

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for five years, incredibly,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the number of standard cell phones

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
offered by US carriers with free VOIP

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is zero!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I can't figure out why!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Laughter)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Actually, I need to update that. There's one now.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It comes from T-Mobile.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I am not paid by T-Mobile.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm not plugging T-Mobile.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is because it was introduced last year

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
on June 29.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm like, can you imagine being the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
T-Mobile PR lady? You know?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
"Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and we're not talking smartphones --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
all your calls are free.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The answer is, "All the time!"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Because they give you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a regular wireless router that works with the phone,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for your house.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Which is really ingenious, because we all know that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Laughter)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We're putting it in our homes for them!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the call is handed off in mid-syllable,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we use at the New York Times to test this gear.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
This is me with a camcorder on a phone

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
going like this.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
(Laughter)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
into the cellular network on a call with my wife --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
look at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
DP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk -- do you mind?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
JP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
DP: What are you guys doing?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Right there!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The bottom line is that the boundaries,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is that although switching technologies is very advanced,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the billing technology has not caught up.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So what I mean is that you can start a call

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
which would be like 10 minutes --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the call will continue to be free.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Because they don't, they haven't --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
well, no, wait! Not so fast.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It also works the other way.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So if you start a call on your cellular network

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and you come home, you keep being billed.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Which is why most people with this service

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
get into the habit of saying,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now you get it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
right? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
You can make free unlimited calls

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
home to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This is another favorite of mine.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Does anyone here have a working cell phone

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
OK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.]

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
(Laughter)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I should know not to do technology demos

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Anyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Excuse me one second.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Hello?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Oh. Where are you calling from?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Oh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
(Laughter)

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
All right! We've made the point.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
(Laughter)

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So this is Grand Central at work -- it's a --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
oh, for gods sake!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I have your numbers now!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
(Laughter)

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
You will pay.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Grand Central is this really brilliant idea

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where they give you a new phone number,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(this is the EG crowd).

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The beauty of that is you never miss a call.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I know a lot of you are like,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But the beauty is it's all going through the internet,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
so you get all of these really cool features --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
like you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And I want these people to hear this greeting,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Very, very customizable.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
By the way, this is something that really bothers me.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
they charge you two bucks.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Did you know that? It's an outrage.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
What you're going to use is Google Cellular.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's totally free -- there's not even ads.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You send a text message to the word "Google,"

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
which turns out to be 46645.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Leave off the last "e" for savings.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Anyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You hit send, and in five seconds,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
they will send you back the two closest drugstores,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
complete with name address and phone number.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Here it comes.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It works with weather, too.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then in five seconds, they send you back

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the complete weather forecast for that town.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Here we go. And those are just the beginning.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
yeah! You're all trying to write this down.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is that it requires you to know how to text --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
send a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So I'm going to teach you something even better.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
This is called Google Info.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So lets say I'm in Monterey,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and I want what?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I want to find what? Bagels. OK.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Google: Say the business and the city and state.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
DP: Bagels, Monterey, California.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I got the Chinese line.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
(Laughter)

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Google: Bagels, Monterey, California.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Top eight results: Number one,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
To select number one, you can press one or say "number one."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Number two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Number Two. Number Two. Two.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Laughter)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Why do I listen to people in the audience?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well anyway -- oh! Here we go!

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Google: ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue, Monterey.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
DP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Google: Hold on.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
(Laughter)

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
DP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So anyway, you never even find out the number.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It's just so amazing.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This you can ask by voice any question.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Who won the 1958 World Series?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"Which actors have played James Bond?"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They text me back this: "Sean Connery,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Right! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Just to see how the recognition was.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
How can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
on the other end of the line."

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Because there is one!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
They have 10,000 people

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
who are being paid 20 cents per answer.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
That's who can afford to do that.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
tough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?"

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You know. It's just absolutely amazing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
When I call to leave you a message,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I get 15 seconds of instructions

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
from a third-grade teacher on Ambien!

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
(Laughter)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
"To page this person ... "

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Page? What is this, 1975?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Nobody has pagers anymore.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
"You may begin speaking at the tone.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
When you have finished recording,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you may hang up." No!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And then it gets worse:

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
when I call to retrieve my messages,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
first of all: "You have 87 messages.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
To listen to your messages ... "

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Why else am I calling?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
(Laughter)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Of course I want to listen to the messages!

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
(Laughter)

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Oh! You all have cell phones too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So last year I went to Milan, Italy,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and I got to speak to an audience

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And I said as a joke -- as a joke, I said,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
If you check your voicemail twice a day,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that's 100 million dollars a year.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?"

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
No chuckle. They're like this --

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Where is the outrage, people? Rise up!

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
(Laughter)

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Sorry. I'm not bitter.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
(Laughter)

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
There are these services that transcribe

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
your voicemail into text.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And they send it either to your email

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
or as text messages to your phone.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It is a life-changer.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And by the way, they don't always get the words right,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
because it's over the phone and all that.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
so you can listen to double-check.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
The services are called things like Spinvox,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Phonetag -- this is the one I use --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Callwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I don't really want people listening in to my calls."

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
The executives at these companies told me,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
The reason I think that is that

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
on the first day I tried one of these services,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
(Laughter)

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So you be the judge.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
(Laughter)

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Anyway, this service, Callwave, promises

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
of your messages.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
(Laughter)

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So I thought I'd see how that goes.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
This is me testing it out.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
(Video): Hello, this is Michael.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Hey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
She's in room -- emergency room 53W.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
OK, talk to you later -- bye.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
(Laughter)

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I love my job.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
(Laughter)

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I got the text message version. Now remember,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
a text message can only be 160 characters long.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I'm not kidding you. The message said,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
"Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
(Laughter)

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
What the f -- ?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
(Laughter)

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Well I guess that was the gist.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(Laughter)

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Basically, you're going to go on some

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
iffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
So you go and you type in your phone number,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and at the exact minute where you want to be called --

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
(Laughter)

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And at that moment your phone will ring.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this."

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
The really beautiful thing is,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
hear a little bit of the caller.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So they give you a choice

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
of what you want to hear on the other end.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Here's the girlfriend.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Phone: Hey you, what's going on?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
DP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Phone: Well, that's good.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
DP: What are you doing?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
DP: Right, I can't really talk right now.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
This is the -- I love this -- the boss call.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Phone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
DP: Oh, hi, sir.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago? That photocopier training?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Phone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
DP: It was like three weeks ago.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Phone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
(Laughter)

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I think the biggest change when Internet met phone

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
was with the iPhone.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
It was when in the fall of 2006,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
(Laughter)

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I looked like a moron. However, my logic was good,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
because -- I don't know if you realize this, but -- until the iPhone came along,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
the carriers -- Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cingular --

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
held veto power over every aspect

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
of every design of every phone.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I know the people who worked on the Treo.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
They went around to these carriers and said,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
"Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I don't think so."

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
It was not very conducive to innovation.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
if you'll let me design this phone in peace --

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and you won't even see it till it's done."

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Finally Cingular said OK.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Please don't corner me at the party tonight

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
- you know. I'm not.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
was that all those carriers saw

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones."

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
(Applause)

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Another thing was that it let 10 million people,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
for the first time, experience being online all the time.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Not using these 60-dollar-a-month

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
cellular cards for their laptops.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I don't understand why we're not there yet.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!"

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
(Laughter)

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
"We had wireless base stations that could

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
broadcast -- yay, about 150 feet across."

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
(Laughter)

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
It's absurd. We have power outlets

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
in every room of every building. We have running water.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
What's the problem?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
You have to go to YouTube

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and type in "iPhone Shuffle."

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
This guy did a mock video of one

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
It's like, "It only has one button.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Touch it and it dials a number at random."

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
(Laughter)

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
"Who the hell is this?"

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
(Laughter)

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
But the other thing it did

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
is it opened up this idea of an app store.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
It downloads right to the phone.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And you can use the tilt sensor

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
to steer this car using this game.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
These programs can use all the components

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
of the iPhone -- the touch screen.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
You know how you erase it?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Of course. You shake it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Right, of course. We shake it to erase, like this.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
They have 10,000 of these programs.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
This is the translator program. They have every language in the world.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
This is amazing. This is Midomi.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
A song is running through your head --

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
you sing it into the thing:

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I know. It's insane, right?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio --

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
you type in a band or a song name.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
It will immediately play you that song or that band.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
You say if you like this song or not.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
If you like it, it tries another song on you

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
theme and tempo.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
If you like that one, or don't like it,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
so that it completely stops playing bad songs.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
It eventually only plays songs you like.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
You want to find a place to eat. You shake it.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
It proposes a restaurant.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It gives you the price, and the location and ratings.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Of course, its not just about the iPhone.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
that will soon be on handsets -- phones from 34 companies.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Touch screen -- very, very nice.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Also with its own app store, where you can download programs.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
This is amazing. In the wake of all this,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Verizon, the most calcified, corporate,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
conservative carrier of all,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
said, "You can use any phone you want on our network."

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I love the Wired headline:

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Pigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No. Really.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
So everything is changing. We've entered

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
a new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
customized the way you want it.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Can I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
(Applause)

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
It's only three pounds,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
or 12 if you install Microsoft Office.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
(Laughter)

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Sorry, that was mean.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Ladies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.537
it was the number one video on YouTube.

00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:28.883
(To the tune of "My Way")

00:24:28.883 --> 00:24:33.000
And now the end is near.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I'm sick to death

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
of this old cell phone.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Bad sound, the signal's weak,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
the software stinks.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
A made-in-Hell phone.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I've heard there's something new --

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
a million times more rad than my phone.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
I too will join the cult.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I want an iPhone.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws;

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
we may just face it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
No keys, no memory card,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the battery's sealed --

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
you can't replace it.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
But God, this thing is sweet.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
You had me from, "Hello."

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I want an iPhone.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I want to touch its precious screen.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I want to wipe the smudges clean.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I want my friends to look and drool.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I want to say, "Look -- now I'm cool"

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I stood in line and I'll get mine.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I want an iPhone.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
For what is a man?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
What has he got? If not iPhone,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
then he's got squat.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's all the things a phone should be.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Who cares if it's AT&amp;T?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I took a stand, paid half a grand!

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And I got an iPhone!

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
(Applause)

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
(Applause)
