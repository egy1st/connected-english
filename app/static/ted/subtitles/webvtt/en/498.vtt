WEBVTT

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.602
I coined my own definition
of success in 1934,

00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:07.563
when I was teaching at a high school
in South Bend, Indiana,

00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:12.347
being a little bit disappointed,
and [disillusioned] perhaps,

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:16.418
by the way parents of the youngsters
in my English classes

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.291
expected their youngsters
to get an A or a B.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:23.212
They thought a C was all right
for the neighbors' children,

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.203
because they were all average.

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:27.362
But they weren't satisfied
when their own --

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:31.354
it would make the teacher feel that they
had failed, or the youngster had failed.

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:32.561
And that's not right.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:35.578
The good Lord in his infinite
wisdom didn't create us all equal

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.339
as far as intelligence is concerned,

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:39.838
any more than we're equal
for size, appearance.

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:43.547
Not everybody could earn an A or a B,
and I didn't like that way of judging,

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:47.680
and I did know how
the alumni of various schools

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:51.339
back in the '30s judged
coaches and athletic teams.

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:56.389
If you won them all, you were considered
to be reasonably successful --

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:57.567
not completely.

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:58.964
Because I found out --

00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:02.351
we had a number of years at UCLA
where we didn't lose a game.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.874
But it seemed that we didn't win
each individual game

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.864
by the margin that some
of our alumni had predicted --

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:11.976
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.572
And quite frequently I really felt
that they had backed up their predictions

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.151
in a more materialistic manner.

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:19.333
(Laughter)

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:22.579
But that was true back
in the 30s, so I understood that.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.763
But I didn't like it,
I didn't agree with it.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:28.326
I wanted to come up with something
I hoped could make me a better teacher,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.470
and give the youngsters
under my supervision,

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:32.612
be it in athletics
or the English classroom,

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:34.102
something to which to aspire,

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.669
other than just a higher
mark in the classroom,

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:40.323
or more points in some athletic contest.

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:42.710
I thought about that for quite a spell,

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.955
and I wanted to come
up with my own definition.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.524
I thought that might help.

00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:48.976
And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.048
as the accumulation
of material possessions

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:55.429
or the attainment of a position of power
or prestige, or something of that sort,

00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:57.365
worthy accomplishments perhaps,

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.875
but in my opinion, not necessarily
indicative of success.

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.286
So I wanted to come up
with something of my own.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.173
And I recalled --

00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:07.524
I was raised on a small farm
in Southern Indiana,

00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:09.533
and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers

00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:12.856
that you should never try to be
better than someone else.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.325
I'm sure at the time he did
that, I didn't -- it didn't --

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.499
well, somewhere, I guess
in the hidden recesses of the mind,

00:02:19.523 --> 00:02:20.976
it popped out years later.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.976
Never try to be better than someone else,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.453
always learn from others.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.850
Never cease trying to be
the best you can be --

00:02:26.874 --> 00:02:28.491
that's under your control.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.976
If you get too engrossed
and involved and concerned

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.620
in regard to the things
over which you have no control,

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:37.359
it will adversely affect the things
over which you have control.

00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:39.860
Then I ran across
this simple verse that said,

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:41.877
"At God's footstool to confess,

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.224
a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.

00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:45.882
'I failed!' he cried.

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:49.976
The Master said, 'Thou didst
thy best, that is success.'"

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
From those things, and one other perhaps,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.753
I coined my own definition
of success, which is:

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:58.063
Peace of mind attained only
through self-satisfaction

00:02:58.087 --> 00:03:01.826
in knowing you made the effort to do
the best of which you're capable.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.134
I believe that's true.

00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:06.085
If you make the effort to do
the best of which you're capable,

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.742
trying to improve the situation
that exists for you,

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:09.919
I think that's success,

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:11.928
and I don't think others can judge that;

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:13.727
it's like character and reputation --

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.602
your reputation
is what you're perceived to be;

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:18.484
your character is what you really are.

00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:21.682
And I think that character
is much more important

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:23.476
than what you are perceived to be.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.254
You'd hope they'd both be good,

00:03:25.278 --> 00:03:27.975
but they won't necessarily be the same.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.976
Well, that was my idea that I was going
to try to get across to the youngsters.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.452
I ran across other things.

00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:38.586
I love to teach, and it was
mentioned by the previous speaker

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.761
that I enjoy poetry,
and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:43.976
There are some things
that helped me, I think,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.776
be better than I would have been.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.370
I know I'm not what I ought
to be, what I should be,

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.527
but I think I'm better
than I would have been

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:52.461
if I hadn't run across certain things.

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:56.311
One was just a little verse that said,

00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:00.387
"No written word, no spoken plea

00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:02.976
can teach our youth what they should be;

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.382
nor all the books on all the shelves --

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.634
it's what the teachers are themselves."

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:11.451
That made an impression
on me in the 1930s.

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:15.750
And I tried to use that
more or less in my teaching,

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:20.346
whether it be in sports, or whether
it be in the English classroom.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.174
I love poetry and always had
an interest in that somehow.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:29.976
Maybe it's because Dad
used to read to us at night,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.158
by coal oil lamp --

00:04:31.182 --> 00:04:34.534
we didn't have electricity
in our farm home.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.438
And Dad would read poetry to us.
So I always liked it.

00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:39.976
And about the same time
I ran across this one verse,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.667
I ran across another one.

00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:45.507
Someone asked a lady teacher
why she taught,

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:48.571
and after some time, she said
she wanted to think about that.

00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:50.475
Then she came up and said,

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.388
"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,

00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:55.912
'Where could I find
such splendid company?'

00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:58.976
There sits a statesman,
strong, unbiased, wise;

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.698
another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:04.976
A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,
steady hand may mend a bone,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.976
or stem the life-blood's flow.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.048
And there a builder; upward rise
the arch of a church he builds,

00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:13.508
wherein that minister
may speak the word of God,

00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:15.976
and lead a stumbling soul
to touch the Christ.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.975
And all about, a gathering of teachers,

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.317
farmers, merchants, laborers --

00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:21.993
those who work and vote and build

00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:24.388
and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.

00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:27.730
And I may say, I may not see the church,

00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:30.572
or hear the word, or eat
the food their hands may grow,

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.833
but yet again I may;

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.008
And later I may say,

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:37.087
I knew him once, and he was weak,
or strong, or bold or proud or gay.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:39.456
I knew him once, but then he was a boy.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.750
They ask me why I teach and I reply,

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:44.424
'Where could I find such
splendid company?'"

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.376
And I believe the teaching profession --

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.462
it's true, you have so many youngsters,

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:50.875
and I've got to think
of my youngsters at UCLA --

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.711
30-some attorneys,
11 dentists and doctors,

00:05:55.735 --> 00:05:58.976
many, many teachers and other professions.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.798
And that gives you
a great deal of pleasure,

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:04.426
to see them go on.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.514
I always tried to make the youngsters feel
that they're there to get an education,

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:11.742
number one; basketball was second,
because it was paying their way,

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:14.273
and they do need a little time
for social activities,

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:17.884
but you let social activities take
a little precedence over the other two,

00:06:17.908 --> 00:06:20.237
and you're not going
to have any very long.

00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:24.976
So that was the idea
that I tried to get across

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.427
to the youngsters under my supervision.

00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:29.257
I had three rules, pretty much,

00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:31.602
that I stuck with
practically all the time.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:35.554
I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,
and I decided they were very important.

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:39.478
One was "Never be late."

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:43.747
Later on I said certain things --

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:47.976
the players, if we were leaving
for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.976
There was a time when I made them
wear jackets and shirts and ties.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.785
Then I saw our chancellor coming
to school in denims and turtlenecks,

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.776
and thought, it's not right for me to keep
this other [rule] so I let them just --

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.380
they had to be neat and clean.

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:10.033
I had one of my greatest players
that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.

00:07:10.057 --> 00:07:13.750
He came to catch the bus; we were
leaving for somewhere to play.

00:07:13.774 --> 00:07:17.104
And he wasn't clean and neat,
so I wouldn't let him go.

00:07:17.128 --> 00:07:18.512
He couldn't get on the bus,

00:07:18.536 --> 00:07:20.446
he had to go home and get cleaned up

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.597
to get to the airport.

00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:24.976
So I was a stickler for that.
I believed in that.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.884
I believe in time; very important.

00:07:26.908 --> 00:07:30.556
I believe you should be on time,
but I felt at practice, for example --

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.596
we start on time, we close on time.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.017
The youngsters didn't have to feel
that we were going to keep them over.

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.033
When I speak at coaching clinics,
I often tell young coaches --

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:41.197
and at coaching clinics, more or less,

00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:44.205
they'll be the younger coaches
getting in the profession.

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:47.713
Most of them are young, you know,
and probably newly-married.

00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:50.752
And I tell them,
"Don't run practices late,

00:07:50.776 --> 00:07:52.805
because you'll go home in a bad mood,

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:56.177
and that's not good, for a young
married man to go home in a bad mood.

00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:59.168
When you get older, it doesn't
make any difference, but --"

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:02.976
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.267
So I did believe: on time.

00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:07.416
I believe starting on time,
and I believe closing on time.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.976
And another one I had was,
not one word of profanity.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.976
One word of profanity,
and you are out of here for the day.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.286
If I see it in a game, you're going
to come out and sit on the bench.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.976
And the third one was,
never criticize a teammate.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.976
I didn't want that. I used to tell
them I was paid to do that.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.976
That's my job. I'm paid to do it.
Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.976
Not like the coaches today,
for gracious sakes, no.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.388
It's a little different
than it was in my day.

00:08:34.412 --> 00:08:39.093
Those were three things that I stuck
with pretty closely all the time.

00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:41.735
And those actually came from my dad.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:46.656
That's what he tried to teach
me and my brothers at one time.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.554
I came up with a pyramid eventually,

00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:52.284
that I don't have the time to go on that.

00:08:52.308 --> 00:08:55.538
But that helped me, I think,
become a better teacher.

00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:57.483
It's something like this:

00:08:57.507 --> 00:08:59.705
And I had blocks in the pyramid,

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:02.976
and the cornerstones being
industriousness and enthusiasm,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.096
working hard and enjoying
what you're doing,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.976
coming up to the apex,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.976
according to my definition of success.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.333
And right at the top, faith and patience.

00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:14.762
And I say to you,
in whatever you're doing,

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:15.946
you must be patient.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.720
You have to have patience to --
we want things to happen.

00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:23.815
We talk about our youth
being impatient a lot, and they are.

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.981
They want to change everything.
They think all change is progress.

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.576
And we get a little older --
we sort of let things go.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.211
And we forget there is
no progress without change.

00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:33.625
So you must have patience,

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.635
and I believe that we must have faith.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:38.294
I believe that we must
believe, truly believe.

00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:40.278
Not just give it word service,

00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:42.976
believe that things
will work out as they should,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.314
providing we do what we should.

00:09:45.338 --> 00:09:50.007
I think our tendency is to hope things
will turn out the way we want them to

00:09:50.031 --> 00:09:51.294
much of the time,

00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:54.657
but we don't do the things
that are necessary

00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:57.976
to make those things become reality.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.976
I worked on this for some 14 years,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.976
and I think it helped me
become a better teacher.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.154
But it all revolved around that
original definition of success.

00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:09.223
You know, a number of years ago,

00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:12.976
there was a Major League Baseball
umpire by the name of George Moriarty.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.587
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.

00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.522
I'd never seen that before, but he did.

00:10:18.546 --> 00:10:20.363
Big league baseball players --

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:22.458
they're very perceptive
about those things,

00:10:22.482 --> 00:10:24.976
and they noticed he had
only one 'i' in his name.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.624
You'd be surprised how many also told him

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:30.976
that that was one more
than he had in his head

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.157
at various times.

00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:33.929
(Laughter)

00:10:33.953 --> 00:10:35.999
But he wrote something
where I think he did

00:10:36.023 --> 00:10:37.739
what I tried to do in this pyramid.

00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:40.166
He called it "The Road
Ahead, or the Road Behind."

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.976
He said, "Sometimes I think the Fates
must grin as we denounce them and insist

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.189
the only reason we can't win,
is the Fates themselves have missed.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:49.976
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.729
we win or lose within ourselves.

00:10:51.753 --> 00:10:54.976
The shining trophies on our shelves
can never win tomorrow's game.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.286
You and I know deeper down, there's
always a chance to win the crown.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.976
But when we fail to give our best,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.079
we simply haven't met the test,
of giving all and saving none

00:11:03.103 --> 00:11:04.826
until the game is really won;

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.244
of showing what is meant by grit;

00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:09.348
of playing through when others quit;

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.076
of playing through, not letting up.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.839
It's bearing down that wins the cup.

00:11:12.863 --> 00:11:16.220
Of dreaming there's a goal ahead;
of hoping when our dreams are dead;

00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:19.976
of praying when our hopes have fled;
yet losing, not afraid to fall,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.811
if, bravely, we have given all.

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:25.690
For who can ask more of a man
than giving all within his span.

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:29.976
Giving all, it seems to me,
is not so far from victory.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.286
And so the Fates are seldom wrong,
no matter how they twist and wind.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.976
It's you and I who make our fates --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.976
we open up or close the gates
on the road ahead or the road behind."

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.525
Reminds me of another set of threes
that my dad tried to get across to us:

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:46.642
Don't whine. Don't complain.
Don't make excuses.

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:47.904
Just get out there,

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:50.808
and whatever you're doing,
do it to the best of your ability.

00:11:50.832 --> 00:11:52.976
And no one can do more than that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.881
I tried to get across, too, that --

00:11:55.905 --> 00:11:58.985
my opponents will tell you --
you never heard me mention winning.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:00.538
Never mention winning.

00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:06.140
My idea is that you can lose
when you outscore somebody in a game,

00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:08.330
and you can win when you're outscored.

00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:11.976
I've felt that way on certain
occasions, at various times.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.286
And I just wanted them to be able
to hold their head up after a game.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.976
I used to say that when a game is over,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.381
and you see somebody
that didn't know the outcome,

00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:25.437
I hope they couldn't tell by your actions

00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:30.976
whether you outscored an opponent
or the opponent outscored you.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.547
That's what really matters:

00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:36.331
if you make an effort
to do the best you can regularly,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:39.042
the results will be
about what they should be.

00:12:39.066 --> 00:12:42.946
Not necessarily what you'd want them to be
but they'll be about what they should;

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.976
only you will know
whether you can do that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.648
And that's what I wanted
from them more than anything else.

00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:51.450
And as time went by,
and I learned more about other things,

00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:53.331
I think it worked a little better,

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.998
as far as the results.

00:12:55.022 --> 00:12:59.976
But I wanted the score of a game
to be the byproduct of these other things,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.976
and not the end itself.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.976
I believe it was one great
philosopher who said --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.938
no, no -- Cervantes.

00:13:09.962 --> 00:13:15.214
Cervantes said, "The journey
is better than the end."

00:13:15.238 --> 00:13:17.047
And I like that.

00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:19.302
I think that it is --
it's getting there.

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:22.017
Sometimes when you get there,
there's almost a let down.

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:24.065
But it's the getting there that's the fun.

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:28.843
As a basketball coach at UCLA,
I liked our practices to be the journey,

00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:32.157
and the game would be
the end, the end result.

00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:35.339
I liked to go up and sit in the stands
and watch the players play,

00:13:35.363 --> 00:13:39.976
and see whether I'd done
a decent job during the week.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.583
There again, it's getting the players
to get that self-satisfaction,

00:13:43.607 --> 00:13:50.162
in knowing that they'd made the effort
to do the best of which they are capable.

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:57.333
Sometimes I'm asked who was
the best player I had, or the best teams.

00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:59.976
I can never answer that.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.976
As far as the individuals are concerned --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.976
I was asked one time about that,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.168
and they said,

00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:12.007
"Suppose that you, in some way,
could make the perfect player.

00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:13.191
What would you want?"

00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:16.191
And I said, "Well, I'd want
one that knew why he was at UCLA:

00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:18.976
to get an education,
he was a good student,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.500
really knew why he was there
in the first place.

00:14:21.524 --> 00:14:23.390
But I'd want one that could play, too.

00:14:23.414 --> 00:14:27.579
I'd want one to realize that defense
usually wins championships,

00:14:27.603 --> 00:14:29.674
and who would work hard on defense.

00:14:29.698 --> 00:14:31.976
But I'd want one
who would play offense, too.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.277
I'd want him to be unselfish,

00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.444
and look for the pass first
and not shoot all the time.

00:14:37.468 --> 00:14:40.580
And I'd want one
that could pass and would pass.

00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:41.801
(Laughter)

00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:43.745
I've had some that could and wouldn't,

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:45.871
and I've had some that would and could.

00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.530
(Laughter)

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.976
So, yeah, I'd want that.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.777
And I wanted them to be able
to shoot from the outside.

00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:55.158
I wanted them to be good inside too.

00:14:55.182 --> 00:14:56.976
(Laughter)

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.976
I'd want them to be able
to rebound well at both ends, too.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.976
Why not just take someone like
Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.872
He had the qualifications.

00:15:06.896 --> 00:15:11.603
Not the only one, but he was one
that I used in that particular category,

00:15:11.627 --> 00:15:14.611
because I think he made the effort
to become the best.

00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:15.801
There was a couple.

00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:18.771
I mention in my book,
"They Call Me Coach,"

00:15:18.795 --> 00:15:21.096
two players that gave
me great satisfaction,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.842
that came as close as I think anyone
I ever had to reach their full potential:

00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:27.261
one was Conrad Burke,
and one was Doug McIntosh.

00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:30.779
When I saw them as freshmen,
on our freshmen team --

00:15:30.803 --> 00:15:33.653
freshmen couldn't play
varsity when I taught.

00:15:33.677 --> 00:15:36.977
I thought, "Oh gracious, if these
two players, either one of them" --

00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:40.953
they were different years, but I thought
about each one at the time he was there --

00:15:40.977 --> 00:15:42.976
"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.756
our varsity must be pretty miserable,
if he's good enough to make it."

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.711
And you know, one of them was
a starting player for a season and a half.

00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:57.976
The other one, his next year, played 32
minutes in a national championship game,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.705
Did a tremendous job for us.

00:15:59.729 --> 00:16:03.604
The next year, he was a starting player
on the national championship team,

00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:06.810
and here I thought he'd never
play a minute, when he was --

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:11.511
so those are the things
that give you great joy,

00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:12.976
and great satisfaction to see.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.976
Neither one of those youngsters
could shoot very well.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.191
But they had outstanding
shooting percentages,

00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:20.452
because they didn't force it.

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:23.158
And neither one could jump very well,

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:26.602
but they kept good position,
and so they did well rebounding.

00:16:26.626 --> 00:16:30.310
They remembered that every shot that's
taken, they assumed would be missed.

00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:33.268
I've had too many stand around
and wait to see if it's missed,

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:37.929
then they go and it's too late,
somebody else is in there ahead of them.

00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:40.567
They weren't very quick,
but they played good position,

00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:41.976
kept in good balance.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.531
And so they played
pretty good defense for us.

00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:47.708
So they had qualities that --
they came close to --

00:16:47.732 --> 00:16:51.149
as close to reaching
possibly their full potential

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:53.442
as any players I ever had.

00:16:53.466 --> 00:16:59.943
So I consider them to be as successful
as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:01.696
or many of the others that we had;

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.459
there were some outstanding players.

00:17:06.617 --> 00:17:08.682
Have I rambled enough?

00:17:08.706 --> 00:17:12.833
I was told that when he makes
his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.

00:17:12.857 --> 00:17:14.127
(Laughter)

00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:18.000
(Applause)
