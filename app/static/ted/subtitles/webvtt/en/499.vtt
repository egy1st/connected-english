00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When most people think about the beginnings

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the virus that causes it, HIV.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This photo was taken before the Great Depression

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in Brazzaville, Congo.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
At this time, there were thousands of individuals,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we think, that were infected with HIV.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If this virus was in thousands

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of individuals at this point,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
why was it the case that it took us until 1984

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to be able to discover this virus?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
OK now, more importantly,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
had we seen this disease, had we understood

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
viruses come from animals.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
from animals into human populations.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that are going to be very very difficult to address --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
as we've seen in the case of HIV.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So during the last 15 years,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
by my mentor Don Burke.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is the idea that we can study the sort of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
pinging of these viruses into human populations,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the movement of these agents over into humans;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and by capturing this moment,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
some pictures now from the field.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a picture of a central African hunter.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's actually a fairly common picture.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One of the things I want you to note from it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This was absolutely key for us. This is a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
very intimate form of connection.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And so we've been studying people like this individual.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We collect blood from them, other specimens.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
early on, as they're moving over into human populations.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And the basic objective of this work is not to just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
go out once and look at these individuals,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but to establish thousands of individuals

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in these populations that we would monitor

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
continuously on a regular basis.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We would actually enlist them --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
When they sample from animals,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
they collect the blood on the filter paper

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the ones that are actually being hunted.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
two hunters stalk their prey.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Their names are Patrice and Patee.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They're searching for bush meat;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
forest animals they can kill to feed their families.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
in the forest around their homes.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
rodents -- anything they can, really.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The animals are simply gone.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We stop for a drink of water.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Then there is a rustle in the brush.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
A group of hunters approach,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
their packs loaded with wild game.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There's at least three viruses

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that you know about, which are in this particular monkey.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Nathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that are present in these animals.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
These individuals are at specific risk,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and possibly infection with novel viruses.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Narrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
NW: So this is from this animal right here,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
at a minimum, been through our basic health education

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
about the risks associated with these activities,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which presumably, from our perspective,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
gives them the ability to decrease their own risk,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and then obviously the risk to their families,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the village, the country, and the world.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm going to be talking about this.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
When your children and grandchildren

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
sort of pose questions to you about this period of time,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
one of the things they're gonna ask you,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
some of the most valuable and endangered species

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
on our planet, to go extinct because we

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
weren't able to address some of the issues

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
of poverty in these parts of the world.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They're also going to ask you the question

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
into the human population,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
why did we let these behaviors continue?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Why did we not find some other solution to this?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
They're going to say, in regions of profound

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
instability throughout the world,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and you don't have sustainable resources like this,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this is going to lead to food insecurity.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But they're also going to ask you probably a different question.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
this is the individual that hunted the monkey

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
from the last picture that I showed you.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
OK, take a look at his shirt.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
You know, take a look at his face.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Bush meat is one of the central crises,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which is occurring in our population right now,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in humanity, on this planet.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
OK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There's no easy solutions,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
at our own peril.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So, in 1998, along with my mentors

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
we went to actually start this work

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in Central Africa, to work with hunters

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
in this part of the world.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and I was really tasked with setting this up.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So I said to myself, "OK, great --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
different locations. It's going to be wonderful."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I figured, no problem.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
(Laughter)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Needless to say, I was drastically wrong.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This is challenging work to do.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Fortunately, I had and continue to have

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and that's the only way that this work can really occur.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We have a whole range of challenges about this work.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
One of them is just obtaining trust

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
from individuals that we work with in the field.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Paul worked for years

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
on the Cameroonian national radio and television,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
be a great communicator.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is that no one had television,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
so they wouldn't recognize his face.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But -- when he began to speak

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
they would actually recognize his voice from the radio.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And this was somebody who had incredible

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
potential to spread aspects of our message,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
or health prevention.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
one of these very rural sites,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
with specimens from 200 individuals

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I like to show this shot -- this is

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Ubald Tamoufe, who's the lead

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
investigator in our Cameroon site.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because of course you can't see his face.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But the reason I like to show the shot

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
(Laughter)

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Which -- which he did, which he did.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Just a few quick before and after shots.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
This was our laboratory before.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is what it looks like now.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Early on, in order to ship our specimens,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Laughter)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
No comment.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
this work, we actually surprised ourselves.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We made a number of discoveries.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And what we've found is that if you look in the right place,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
you can actually monitor the flow

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
of these viruses into human populations.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
including new viruses in the same group

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
human population -- it's something we should be aware of.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It's something we should be following. It's not something

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that we should be surprised by.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Needless to say in the past

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
these viruses entering into these rural communities

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
might very well have gone extinct.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And critically, what happens in central Africa

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
doesn't stay in Central Africa.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So, once we discovered that it was really possible

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that we could actually do this monitoring,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
we decided to move this from research, to

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Through generous support and partnership

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and begin work in four different sites

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
in Africa and Asia.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
have different sorts of contact.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It's also working in live animal markets --

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
SARS emerged in Asia.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Our objective right now, in addition to

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
deploying to these sites and getting everything moving,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is to identify new partners

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because we feel like this effort needs to be extended

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
so that we can catch these things, ideally,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
before they make it to blood banks,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
sexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
There was a time not very long ago

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
when the discovery of unknown organisms

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
was something that held incredible awe for us.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and thought about ourselves.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Many people, I think, on our planet right now

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
despair, and they think

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
If an intelligent extra-terrestrial

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
27 out of 30 of these volumes

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
would be devoted to bacteria and virus,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
with just a few of the volumes left

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
for plants, fungus and animals,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
humans being a footnote;

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
This is honestly the most exciting period

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
The dominant things that exist here

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we know almost nothing about.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and understand them.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
(Applause)
