00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And at the time I was very superstitious.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So the plane landed in between the buildings

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I actually went to see some of the design companies

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in Hong Kong in my stay there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And it turned out that --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to have a good time working here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
(Laughter)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but they had put this one right next to it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
(Laughter)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000
However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as "moments that take your breath away."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I won't read them for you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Laughter)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So there are, of course, two different possibilities.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There's one from a consumer's point of view --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
where I was happy while experiencing design.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This is 1983.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that he was willing to borrow to me freely.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And The Police's "Synchronicity"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
cassette had just been released

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So you could drive up into the mountains

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
at least two of them being, you know, design objects.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
if you're happy while actually doing it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Laughter)

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
as well as the Mexicans

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
are very happy.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(Laughter),

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
don't seem to be doing all that well.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
well, also, with an eye on this conference.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Under "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
open as much room for the un-representable --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Then, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
maybe with the exception of the mandala

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and not about happiness.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that's a really easy thing to do.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
This is, you know, a book.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
if you actually want to do something with the subject

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
do it from a cynical point of view.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is, you know, the movie poster.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
familiar with these signs?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
True printed his own version of these signs.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
(Laughter)

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So this is one.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
(Laughter)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So you're

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And it takes you a while until it actually --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Laughter)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Laughter)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now, True is a real humanitarian.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
(Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
sort of like pretending that it's an art project

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Laughter)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Another New York project.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
You don't see the horizon.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And the room is truly something to be seen.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
after spending an hour in there.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud"

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
He's from Korea originally.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Laughter)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And other people go and fill them in.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
(Laughter)

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This one says, "Please let me die in peace."

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
(Laughter)

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I think that was --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is on a musician poster, that says:

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and that, as a result, my recoupable advance

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
from my label will be taken from me,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
after which, my contract will be cancelled,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Laughter)

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Jee gets to have his project;

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
the public gets a sweeter environment;

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and different public gets a place to express itself;

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
(Laughter)

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Which brought me back to my list making --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
You know, one is: just working without pressure.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing --

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
where the content is actually important for me.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And being able to enjoy the end results.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And the whole thing just fell together.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and we made these spreads right out of this.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So it was: "Everything

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I do

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
always

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
comes

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
back

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to me."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
A couple of weeks ago, a

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Laughter)

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
French company asked us to design five billboards for them.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Again, we could supply the content for it.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So I just picked another one.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And this was two weeks ago.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and photographed this one.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So it's: "Trying

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to look

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
good

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
limits

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
my life."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And then we did one more of these.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This is: "Having" --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
this is the same thing;

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
it's just, you know, photographed from the side.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
This is from the front.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Then it's: "guts."

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Then it's: "always

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
works out."

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Then it's "for," with the light on.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Laughter)

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And it's "me."

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Thank you so much.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
(Applause)
