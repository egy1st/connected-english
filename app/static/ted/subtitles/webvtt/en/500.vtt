00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of youth and age.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first one is dedicated to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My poem is called "Dirt."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
half a long century gone

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and still she comes at me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with that thick cruel yellow bar.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All because of a word I said,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
not even said really, only repeated.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But "Open," she says, "open up!"

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
her hand clawing at my head.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I know now her life was hard;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
she lost three children as babies,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
then her husband died too,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
leaving young sons, and no money.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
She'd stand me in the sink to pee

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because there was never room in the toilet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But oh, her soap!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Might its bitter burning have been

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
what made me a poet?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The street she lived on was unpaved,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where she stalked and caught me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Dare I admit that after she did it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I never really loved her again?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She lived to a hundred,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but I never, until now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
loved her again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When that was published in a magazine

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I got an irate letter from my uncle.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
"You have maligned a great woman."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It took some diplomacy.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is called "The Dress."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a longer poem.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In those days,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
those days which exist for me only

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as the most elusive memory now,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
would be a storm of birdsong,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
then the soft clop of the hooves

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the last sound at night as likely as not

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
would be your father pulling up in his car,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
having worked late again, always late,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to shake out the ashes and damp the draft

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
before he came upstairs to fall into bed --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in those long-ago days,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
women, my mother, my friends' mothers,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
our neighbors, all the women I knew --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
wore, often much of the day,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
what were called housedresses,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
cheap, printed, pulpy,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
seemingly purposefully shapeless

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and, when you had to go look for a child,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
hang wash on the line,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
or run down to the grocery store on the corner,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
under a coat,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the twisted hem of the nightgown

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
always lank and yellowed,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
dangling beneath.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
More than the curlers some of the women

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
seemed constantly to have in their hair

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in preparation for some great event --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
a ball, one would think --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that never came to pass;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
more than the way most women's faces

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
not only were never made up during the day,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but seemed scraped, bleached,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
more than all that it was those dresses

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that made women so unknowable and forbidding,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and boys no conception.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Only later would I see the dresses also

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as a proclamation:

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
your bleak concrete yard,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
what you revealed of yourself

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
was a fabulation;

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
your real sensual nature,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
veiled in those sexless vestments,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
was utterly your dominion.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In those days, one hid much else as well:

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
grown men didn't embrace one another,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
unless someone had died,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and not always then; you shook hands

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
once out of childhood you'd never again know

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
not until mores at last had evolved,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
then even kiss (your fathers bristles

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
white and stiff now).

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What release finally, the embrace:

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
how much unspoken joy there was

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in that affirmation of equality and communion,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
no matter how much misunderstanding

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and pain had passed between you by then.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We knew so little in those days,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
as little as now, I suppose

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
about healing those hurts:

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
even the women, in their best dresses,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
even in lipstick and mascara,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
their hair aflow,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
could only stand wringing their hands,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
begging for peace,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
while father and son, like thugs,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
like thieves, like Romans,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
simmered and hissed and hated,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
inflicting sorrows that endured,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the worst anyway,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
through the kiss and embrace,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
bleeding from brother to brother,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
into the generations.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In those days there was still countryside

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
even not far from our building

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you could find tracts with hills and trees

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
you could pretend were mountains and forests.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Or you could go out by yourself

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
even to a half-block-long empty lot,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
already there was wanting to be simpler,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
wanting, when they called you,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
never to go back.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Applause)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This is another longish one,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
about the old and the young.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It actually happened right at the time we met.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Part of the poem takes place in

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
space we shared and time we shared.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's called "The Neighbor."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Her five horrid, deformed little dogs

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
who incessantly yap on the roof under my window.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Her cats, God knows how many,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
who must piss on her rugs --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
her landing's a sickening reek.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
then the door slamming fearfully shut,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
only the barking and the music -- jazz --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
how it brought back my college sweetheart,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
my first real love, who -- till I left her --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
played the same record.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
she was too young for,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It startled, then bored, then repelled me.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in the Village, that my neighbor was her.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
her turning away, hiding her ravaged face

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
A man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
claws scrabbling, then her -- her voice

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
hoarse, harsh, hollow,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
almost only a tone,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
incoherent, a note, a squawk,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
bone on metal, metal gone molten,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
calling them back,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
My sweet angels, come back."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Medea she was, next time I saw her.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
stock-still on the sidewalk

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
ragged coat hanging agape,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
passersby flowing around her,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
her mouth torn suddenly open

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
as though in a scream,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
silently though, as though only in her brain

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
or breast had it erupted.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
A cry so pure, practiced, detached,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
it had no need of a voice,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
or could no longer bear one.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
These invisible links that allure,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The girl, my old love,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the last lost time I saw her

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when she came to find me at a party,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
her drunkenly stumbling, falling,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
swollen with tears, her shame,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
her dishonor.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
my secret pride, my turning away.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Still life on a rooftop,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
dogs, excrement, sky.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
What pathways through pain,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what junctures of vulnerability,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
what crossings and counterings?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Too many lives in our lives already,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
too many chances for sorrow,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
too many unaccounted-for pasts.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
"Behold me," the god of frenzied,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
inexhaustible love says,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Her making her way

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
down the littered vestibule stairs,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
one agonized step at a time.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
My holding the door.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Her crossing the fragmented tiles,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
faltering at the step to the street,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
droning, not looking at me,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Can you help me?"

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Her wavering step into the world.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000
(Applause)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I think I'll lighten up a little.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
(Laughter)

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It's called "Gas."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Wouldn't it be nice, I think,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
bends over the magazine table

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and farts, just a little,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and violently blushes.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
came embodied in visible clouds,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
had only barely grazed my face

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
before it drifted away.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Besides, for this to have happened now

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
while we were on our walk,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
my dog was startled by a backfire

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and jumped straight up like a horse bucking.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And that brought back to me the stable

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I worked on weekends when I was 12,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and a splendid piebald stallion,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
though more hugely of course,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
enormous, gleaming, resplendent.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And the woman, her face abashedly buried

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
in her "Elle" now, reminded me --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
consisted of the fact that with every jump he took

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the horse would powerfully fart.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Something never mentioned

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
in the dozens of books about horses

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and their riders I devoured in those days.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
All that savage grandeur,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the steely glinting hooves,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(Laughter)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
(Applause)

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
This is called "Thirst."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Many -- most of my poems actually

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"Thirst."

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
day and night, on a bench

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
in the 103rd Street subway station,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
until finally one day she vanished.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
We regarded each other, scrutinized one another.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I was afraid some repressed part of myself

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in the shocking seethe of her stench.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Not excrement merely, not merely surface

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and orifice going unwashed,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
rediffusion of rum,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
there was will in it,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and intention, power and purpose --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
a social, ethical rage and rebellion --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
despair too, though, grief, loss.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
bathe her, comfort her, dress her.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Instead, I'd step into my train.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
How rich I would think, is the lexicon

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
of our self-absolving.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
How enduring, our bland fatal assurance

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that reflection is righteousness being accomplished.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The dance of our glances,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the clash, pulling each other through

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
our perceptual punctures,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
then holocaust, holocaust,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
host on host of ill, injured presences,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
squandered, consumed.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Her vigil somewhere I know continues.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
effacement, the perfume of our consternation.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
(Applause)

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The title is "This Happened."

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
A student, a young woman

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
perched on the ledge of an open window

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
chatting with friends between classes;

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a teacher passes and chides her,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
"Be careful, you might fall,"

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
almost banteringly chides her,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
"You might fall,"

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and the young woman, 18, a girl really,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
though she wouldn't think that,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
as brilliant as she is, first in her class,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
smiles back, and leans into the open window,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
which wouldn't even be open if it were winter --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
leans into the window, farther, still smiling,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
farther and farther, though it takes less time

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Herself fall.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
A casual impulse, a fancy,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
No, more than impulse or fancy,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
the girl knows what she's doing,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
the girl means something,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
the girl means to mean,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
because it occurs to her in that instant,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
she's not who she is,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
she's not the person she is,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and the reason, she suddenly knows,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
is that there's been so much premeditation

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
where she is, so much plotting and planning,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
there's hardly a person where she is,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
it's a self inhabited, lived in by her,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and seemingly even as she thinks it

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
she knows what's been missing:

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
grace,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
not premeditation but grace,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
a kind of being in the world spontaneously,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
with grace.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Weightfully upon me was the world.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Weightfully this self which graced the world

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
yet never wholly itself.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the release from which is what I desire

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and what I achieve.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
already now so many times divided,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
the sadness she felt once,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
hardly knowing she felt it,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
to merely inhabit herself.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
even the earth with its compulsion

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
to take unto itself all that falls

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
must know that falling is absurd,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
yet the girl falling isn't myself,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
or she is myself,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Forever. With grace.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
This happened.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
(Applause)

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I like to just end.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and shake his fist at me.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
"Special: big tits,"

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
on our neighborhood newsstand.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But forget her breasts.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
A lush, fresh-lipped blond,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
skin glowing gold, sprawls there,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
resplendent.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
hardly better than harlots, can still stir me.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Maybe a coming of age in the

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
American sensual darkness,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
never seeing an unsmudged nipple,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
an uncensored vagina,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
has left me forever infected

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
with an unquenchable lust of the eye.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Always that erotic murmur,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I'm hardly myself

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
if I'm not in a state of incipient desire.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
God knows though,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
there are worse twists your obsessions can take.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
forbade them to look in one room.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Because there were images in it he said were licentious.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
some trying to cover their genitals,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
others too frightened to bother,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
lined up in snow

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
The girls, to my horror,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
averted their gaze.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Even that though. Another confession:

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Once in a book on pre-war Poland,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
a studio portrait, an absolute angel,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I kept finding myself at her page.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
That she died in the camps made her --

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I didn't dare wonder why --

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
more present, more precious.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Died in the camps, that too people --

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
or Jews anyway --

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
kept from their children back then.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Sex and death, how close they can seem.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
sometimes I think I confound them.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
My wife's loveliness almost consumes me.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
When we make love, her holding me

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
everywhere all around me,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I'm there and not there.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I live my life over, as though I were drowning.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Then I am drowning, in despair

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
at having to leave her,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
this, everything, all,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
unbearable, awful.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Still, to be able to die

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
with no special contrition,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
not having been slaughtered, or enslaved.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And not having to know history's next

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
mad rage or regression,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
it might be a relief.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
No. Again, no.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I don't mean that for a moment.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
the good and the bad --

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
my own follies and weakness

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
that even this counterfeit Venus

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
with gel, so moves me

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
my breath catches.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Vamp. Siren. Seductress.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
How much more she reveals

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
in her glare of ink than she knows.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
How she incarnates

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
our desperate human need for regard,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
our passion to live in beauty,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
to be beauty, to be cherished by glances,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
if by no more, of something like love,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
or love.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Thank you.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
(Applause)
