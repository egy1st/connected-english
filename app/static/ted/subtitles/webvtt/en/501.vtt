00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Your iPhone, your laptop,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And we should save trees in the end.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So it's enough to bury any industry.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Some people say it should be free;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it should be local, run by communities,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or niche, for some smaller groups like business --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but then it's not free; it's very expensive.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It should be opinion-driven;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
less news, more views.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And we'd rather read it during breakfast,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because later we listen to radio in a car,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Because in the long run,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I think there is no reason, no practical reason

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for newspapers to survive.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So what can we do?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let me tell you my story.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They were run by an inexperienced staff,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in many places there were not even art directors.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
"What are you doing for a living?"

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I said, "I'm designing newspapers."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(Laughter)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I had a revelation. I thought,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
"These guys took some creepy,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
run-down entertainment,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and put it to the highest possible level of performance art."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The front page became our signature.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My approach was very egotistic.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I wanted my artistic statement,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
my interpretation of reality.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Not even magazines: posters.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We were experimenting with type,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with illustration, with photos. And we had fun.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Soon it started to bring results.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
In Poland, our pages were named

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Other examples you can see here are from

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and central European countries.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But it's not only about the front page.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The secret is that we were treating

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the whole newspaper as one piece,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as one composition -- like music.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And design is responsible for this experience.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Flipping through pages is readers experience,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and I'm responsible for this experience.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because that's how readers perceive it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
on biggest infographic competition in Spain.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And two years later,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the same award came to Estonia.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Isn't amazing?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
were growing too.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Just some examples:

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in Russia, plus 11 after one year,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
plus 29 after three years of the redesign.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
raise of circulation after three years.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You can see on a graph,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
just after redesign.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But the real hit was in Bulgaria.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And that is really amazing.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Did design do this?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Design was just a part of the process.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And the process we made was not about changing the look,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
it was about improving the product completely.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I took an architectural rule about function and form

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and translated it into newspaper content and design.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I put strategy at the top of it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Then we adjust the content accordingly.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And then, usually after two months, we start designing.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Why am I asking all of these business questions,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
instead of just showing them pages?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So what is the lesson behind it?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company;

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
it can turn your company upside down.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It can even change you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And who's responsible? Designers.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Give power to designers.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Applause)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But the second is even more important.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You can live in a small poor country, like me.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You can work for a small company,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in a boring branch.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You can have no budgets, no people --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but still can put your work to the highest possible level.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And everybody can do it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
You just need inspiration, vision and determination.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And you need to remember that to be good

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is not enough.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Thank you.
