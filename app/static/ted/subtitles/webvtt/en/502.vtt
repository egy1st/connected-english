00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I started with paragliding.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Paragliding is taking off from mountains

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a paraglider, with the possibility to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
fly cross-country, distance,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
just with the use of thermals to soar.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
with a paraglider.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
From there I started with skydiving.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this picture you can see

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
there is a four-way skydive,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
four people flying together,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and on the left hand side it's the camera flier

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with the camera mounted to his helmet

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so he can film the whole jump,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for the film itself and also for the judging.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
From regular, relative skydiving

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I went on to freeflying.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can see the skydiver with the red suit,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
he's in a stand-up position.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The one with the yellow-green suit,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
he's flying head-down.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in freefall also, with the helmet cam

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to film this jump.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You can imagine with this big surface

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of a skysurfing board,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
there is a lot of force, a lot of power.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Of course I can use this power

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Wingsuit flying is a suit,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that I can make fly, just only with my body.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I can make it fly. And as you see

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the fall rate is much much slower

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
because of the bigger surface.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to gain quite some distance.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
From there with all the skills and knowledge

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
from paragliding and all the different disciplines

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
meaning mountains, cliffs.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of being in free fall,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
with all the visual references.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So my goal soon was to discover new places

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that nobody had jumped before.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
a very famous mountain that probably

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
everybody knows in here.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
three very famous mountains in Switzerland.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The special thing on these three jumps were,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So with all this knowledge, I also

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
wanted to get into stunts.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So with some friends we started to do different tricks,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
like for example this jump here,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I jumped from a paraglider.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because it was very cold in Austria

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
where we did this filming.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Everybody sitting in a basket,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I was on top of the balloon,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
ready to slide down with my skysurf board.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Laughter)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Extreme sports on top level like this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is only possible if you practice step by step,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
if you really work hard on your skills

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and on your knowledge.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
so I'm training a lot.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You need to have the best possible equipment.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And probably the most important is

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And all this to come as close as possible

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to the human dream of being able to fly.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So for 2009,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm training hard for my two new projects.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The first one, I want to set a world record

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And I want to set a new record,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
with the longest distance ever flown.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
For my second project,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I have a sensational idea

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
of a jump that never has been done before.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So now, on the following movie you will see

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
than speaking in English.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Enjoy, and thank you very much.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Applause)

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Applause)

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
June Cohen: I have some questions.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I think we all might have some questions.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Question one: so does that actually feel

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the way the flying dream does?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Because it looks like it might.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
just seconds before, I would say, impact.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
We're still working on it and we're

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
developing the wingsuits to get better performance,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to get more knowledge.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And I believe soon.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
What is the -- there was exhaust coming

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
UE: Nope. It's just smoke.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
JC: Coming off of you?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
UE: Hopefully not.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Laughter)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
JC: That seems dangerous.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
you can see the speed, you can see the way

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
where I was flying.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That's reason number one. And reason number two:

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it's much easier for the camera guy to film

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If I'm using smoke.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
so that you can be tracked. One more question.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
What do you do to to cover your face?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and having your whole face smushed backwards.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
JC: And is that how you usually fly?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
because of landings -- usually it's difficult --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So you have to be prepared.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Laughter)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
JC: ...a round of applause...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Applause)

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
UE: Thank you very much.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Applause)
