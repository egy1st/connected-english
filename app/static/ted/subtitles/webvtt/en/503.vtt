00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was asked by Wilsonart International,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a plastic laminate company, which is

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the largest plastic laminate company in the world --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they asked me to design

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a trade show booth

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in New York, in 2000.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So looking at their three main markets

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for their product which were basically

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
transportation design,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
interiors and furniture,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we came up with the solution of taking

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
an old Airstream trailer and gutting it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and trying to portray laminate,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and a trailer, in kind of a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
fresh, new contemporary look.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When this trailer showed up at my shop

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I can be somebody that can look at this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I decided I had to do some research

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and really figure out what had gone wrong

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
somewhere along the history of Airstream.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What I discovered in these interiors is that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
there was a disconnect between the exterior shell

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the interior architecture of the pieces.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In that the shell was originally conceived

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a lightweight, modern, futuristic,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the interiors were completely out of sync with that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In fact it appeared like they

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
referenced a mountain cabin.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That seemed really like a crisis to me,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that they had never been able to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
develop a vocabulary

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
about escape, and about travel, and modernity

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We really needed to do some archeology

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in an Airstream trailer,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We stripped out all the vinyl

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and zolatone paint that was covering up

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
this just fantastic aluminum shell.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We took off all the visible hardware and trim

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
mocked it up in cardboard,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
pull it out, put it back in.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The main goal was to smooth out the interior,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and begin to speak about motion,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and mobility, and independence.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is that when you're designing there's actually no

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
logical place to stop and start materials

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because of the continuous form of the trailer.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So that became a challenge.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Compounding that,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the material of choice, laminate,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that I was trying to highlight,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
only bends in two dimensions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's a compound curve interior.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What I had to devise was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a way of fooling the eye

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
into believing that all these panels

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
are curved with the shell.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What I came up with was

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a series of second skins

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that basically float over the aluminum shell.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And what I was trying to do there was

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
direct your eye in the space,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They also gave us a way to run power

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
so they function as an electrical chase.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
That trailer led to another commission,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
He said one he would like to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We came up with a fantasy scenario

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of a DJ traveling around the States,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that would collect records and go on tours.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This trailer housed two turntables,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and basically we'd had a great time with this.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
A lot of these ideas migrated into

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the production trailers for Airstream.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They came to me and said,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
rock climbers, would use these things?"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Anyway, I went out to Airstream

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
about six times during the process of building this prototype,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and it's called the Bambi prototype.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
for tooling and molding."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I walked in their prototype facility, and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
it's exactly like my shop, only bigger --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
same tools, same things.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and there's no money for tooling or molding.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
(Applause)
