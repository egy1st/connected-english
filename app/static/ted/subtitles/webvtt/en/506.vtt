00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this idea that there is a narrative line,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that music exists in time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A film also exists in time; it's an experience

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that you should go through emotionally.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
were all about learning something,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and really to follow my journey.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we meet people along the way.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We only meet them once.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's something like life, that once you get in it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you can't get out.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are two clips I want to show you,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the first one is a kind of hodgepodge,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
its just three little moments, four little moments

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with three of the people who are here tonight.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's not the way they occur in the film,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because they are part of much larger scenes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They play off each other in a wonderful way.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
talking about something that is very dear to him,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is the accidents of life.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and perhaps not planned at all.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And those three clips will be followed by a scene of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He built the capital over there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We were the first film crew in there.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it was built entirely by hand,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I think they got a crane the last year.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
dumping them in the forms.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It is the capital of the country,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and it took 23 years to build,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It took as long as the Taj Mahal.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
He died in 1974.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The building was finished in 1983.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So it continued on for many years

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
after he died.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Think about that when you see that building,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And that really struck me about my father,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the sense that he had such belief

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that somehow, doing these things

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the construction stopped totally and he kept working,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because he felt, "Well when the war is done

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
they'll need this building."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Roll that tape.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I came home and I said to my father and mother,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and he's sort of ugly, funny voice,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and he's a teacher at school.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that someday you will hear of him,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because he's really an amazing man."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Frank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Laughter)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
NK: Did you hear that, really?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it was so consistent with his life, you know?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
or I'm going to die in an airport,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
or die jogging without an identification on me.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't know why I sort of carry that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
from that memory of the way he died.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But he was a sort of a nomad at heart.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and how full of influence by circumstance.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We are proud of it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
NK: You're proud of it?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
NK: Do you know anything about the architect?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
he was my father.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Man: Louis Kahn, yes!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Laughter)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Man: Your father, is he alive?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Man: Very pleased to welcome you back.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
NK: Thank you.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
No, he never saw this.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Shamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and since we invited him here,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
he felt that he has got a responsibility.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
He is not a political man,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
but in this guise he has given us

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
the institution for democracy, from where we can rise.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
In that way it is so relevant.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
He didn't care for how much money this country has,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
or whether he would be able to ever finish this building,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
NK: It cost him his life.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
SW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and that is why he is great and we'll remember him.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But he was also human.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now his failure to satisfy the family life,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
is an inevitable association of great people.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But I think his son will understand this,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and will have no sense of grudge,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
or sense of being neglected, I think.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
He cared in a very different manner,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but it takes a lot of time to understand that.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
In social aspect of his life

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
He could not say no to anything,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and that is why, that he cannot say no to things,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we got this building today.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You see, only that way you can be able to understand him.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There is no other shortcut,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
no other way to really understand him.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000
But I think he has given us this building

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and we feel all the time for him,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that's why, he has given love for us.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
He could not probably give the right kind of love for you,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that is important.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You have to understand that.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He had an enormous amount of love,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
he loved everybody.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
To love everybody, he sometimes did not see

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the very closest ones,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and that is inevitable for men of his stature.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
(Applause)
