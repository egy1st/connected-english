00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
They've been here for billions of years,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So they are one cell and they have this special property

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that they only have one piece of DNA.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They have very few genes,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And the way bacteria make a living

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is that they consume nutrients from the environment,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
they grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except that what I would argue is that you have

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
an amazing interaction with these critters.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This man is supposed to represent

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a generic human being,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
who we are and able to do all the things that we do,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in you or on you at any moment in your life.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, 10 times more bacterial cells

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
than human cells on a human being.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And of course it's the DNA that counts,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You have about 30,000 genes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
playing a role in you or on you all of your life.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
At the best, you're 10 percent human,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but more likely about one percent human,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
depending on which of these metrics you like.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I know you think of yourself as human beings,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Laughter)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
These bacteria are not passive riders,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
these are incredibly important, they keep us alive.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
They cover us in an invisible body armor

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that keeps environmental insults out

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so that we stay healthy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
They digest our food, they make our vitamins,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they actually educate your immune system

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to keep bad microbes out.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So they do all these amazing things

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that help us and are vital for keeping us alive,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and they never get any press for that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
terrible things as well.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that have no business being in you or on you at any time,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and if they are, they make you incredibly sick.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The question we had is how could they do anything at all?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I mean they're incredibly small,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you have to have a microscope to see one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on the environment

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
if they simply act as individuals.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
way that bacteria live.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
named Vibrio fischeri.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
so it makes bioluminescence,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
like fireflies make light.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We're not doing anything to the cells here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and this is what we see.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What was actually interesting to us

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
was not that the bacteria made light,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but when the bacteria made light.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But when they grew to a certain cell number

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
tell the difference from times when they're alone,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and times when they're in a community,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then all do something together.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and they talk with a chemical language.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When it's alone it doesn't make any light.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that you can think of like hormones,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
the molecules just float away and so no light.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But when the bacteria grow and double

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and they're all participating in making these molecules,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
increases in proportion to cell number.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And when the molecule hits a certain amount

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
they recognize that molecule

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
That's how bioluminescence works --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
they're talking with these chemical words.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and it's been turned on its back,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
they live in there, at high cell number

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that molecule is there, and they're making light.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is because it wants that light.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The way that this symbiosis works

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The squid is nocturnal, so during the day

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
it buries itself in the sand and sleeps,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
but then at night it has to come out to hunt.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that light can penetrate the depth of the water

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
What the squid has developed is a shutter

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Then it has detectors on its back

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And it opens and closes the shutter

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
so the amount of light coming out of the bottom --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which is made by the bacterium --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so the squid doesn't make a shadow.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It actually uses the light from the bacteria

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
so predators can't see its shadow,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
calculate its trajectory, and eat it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and it can't sustain that.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
so they're not making light --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And as the day goes by the bacteria double,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
they release the molecule, and then light comes on

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
at night, exactly when the squid wants it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
First we figured out how this bacterium does this,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to figure out really what's the mechanism.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that's the red box -- it's an enzyme that makes

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that little hormone molecule, the red triangle.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
When the molecule increases to a certain amount --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
which says something about the number of cells --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
it locks down into that receptor

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and information comes into the cells

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that tells the cells to turn on

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
this collective behavior of making light.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we have found that this is not just some anomaly

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
all bacteria have systems like this.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They make chemical words, they recognize those words,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and they turn on group behaviors

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
They vote with these chemical votes,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
What's important for today's talk

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and they start secreting some toxins --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What they do, we now understand,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they count themselves with these little molecules,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and they recognize when they have the right cell number

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
That's how it works.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We also then went to look at what are these molecules --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
these were the red triangles on my slides before.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is the word that it talks with.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So then we started to look at other bacteria,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
What I hope you can see

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
is that the molecules are related.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
in every single species of bacteria.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
What that does is to confer

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
exquisite species specificities to these languages.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So these are private, secret conversations.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
These conversations are for intraspecies communication.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that allows it to count its own siblings.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Once we got that far we thought

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and it's about counting your neighbors,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There has to be a way to take a census

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of the rest of the bacteria in the population.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So we went back to molecular biology

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and started studying different bacteria,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and what we've found now is that

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
in fact, bacteria are multilingual.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
They all have a species-specific system --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
they have a molecule that says "me."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But then, running in parallel to that is a second system

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that we've discovered, that's generic.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and it has its own receptor,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It's used by all different bacteria

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and it's the language of interspecies communication.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
What happens is that bacteria are able to count

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
how many of me and how many of you.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
They take that information inside,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and they decide what tasks to carry out

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
of any given population.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Then again we turn to chemistry,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and we figured out what this generic molecule is --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What the important thing is that we learned

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and makes exactly the same molecule.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So they're all using this molecule

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for interspecies communication.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
This is the bacterial Esperanto.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Laughter)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Once we got that far, we started to learn

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
practical that we can do here as well.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
they communicate with these molecules.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We thought, what if we made these bacteria

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
so they can't talk or they can't hear?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Of course, you've just heard and you already know

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that we're running out of antibiotics.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
They either pop the bacterial membrane,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and that selects for resistant mutants.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And so now of course we have this global problem

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in infectious diseases.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and they don't know to launch virulence.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The first one is we've targeted

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
the intraspecies communication system.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
which you saw -- but they're a little bit different.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And so they lock into those receptors,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and they jam recognition of the real thing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
By targeting the red system,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
what we are able to do is to make

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
so that we've made antagonists

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
of the interspecies communication system.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that work against all bacteria.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
but the logic is exactly the same.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in this case, a mouse,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
its quorum sensing molecules.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that now they're going to launch their attack,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and the animal dies.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What we now know is that if we treat the animal

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
in fact, the animal lives.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and it's going to get us around, at least initially,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
this big problem of resistance.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
they use chemicals as their words,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that we're just now starting to learn about.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Of course what that allows bacteria to do

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
is to be multicellular.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
because it makes a difference.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and they can carry out tasks

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that they could never accomplish

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
if they simply acted as individuals.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
What I would hope that I could further argue to you

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is that this is the invention of multicellularity.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
humans, couple hundred thousand.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We think bacteria made the rules

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
for how multicellular organization works.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We think, by studying bacteria,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
We know that the principles and the rules,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the hope is that they will be applied

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I hope that what you've learned

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
By using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Again of course that's what we do,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
both in a molecular way,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and also in an outward way,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but I think about the molecular stuff.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is exactly what happens in your body.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and what their tasks should be.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Again, we think that bacteria invented that,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that live on the Earth,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
in you or on you, keeping you healthy.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in the hopes of making you more healthy,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
making those conversations better,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
so bacteria can do things that we want them to do

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
better than they would be on their own.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Finally, I wanted to show you

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I hope when you learn things,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
like about how the natural world works --

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
it was done by a child.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Science is done by that demographic.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
It's a really lucky demographic to work with.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and it's just a crazy delightful job.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I want to thank you for inviting me here.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
(Applause)

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Thanks.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:54.000
(Applause)
