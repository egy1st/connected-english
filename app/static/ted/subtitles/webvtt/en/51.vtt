00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The old story about climate protection is that it's costly,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
or it would have been done already.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The new story about climate protection

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is that it's not costly, but profitable.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This was a simple sign error,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as is well known to companies that do it all the time --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for example, Dupont, SD micro electronics.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and they get their money back in two or three years.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's called a profit.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it would be expensive, or we would have done it already,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because markets are essentially perfect.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and nobody could make any money.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But the new story about oil

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
not just incrementally, but completely --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
quite the contrary. The United States, for example,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
can completely eliminate its use of oil

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and rejuvenate the economy at the same time,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
led by business for profit,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
than to keep on buying it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This process will also be catalyzed by the military

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
particularly over oil.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that four colleagues and I wrote

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
about 170,000 downloads so far.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it's independent, it's peer-reviewed

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Around 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And whale oil lit practically every building.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to which the whalers had not been paying attention.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
before they ran out of whales.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and profit-maximizing capitalists.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We've been spending the last few decades

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
for saving and substituting for oil,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and no one had bothered to add them up before.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So when we did, we found some very surprising things.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
On the competitiveness front,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And serious competition from Europe, from Korea,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Maybe a decade, according to my friends in Detroit.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
China has an energy policy

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They're not going to export your uncle's Buick.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And after that comes India.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The point here is, these cars are going to be made super efficient.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The question is, who will make them?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That seems to make more sense.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the more we face a very obvious array of problems.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but nothing is not the right number.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And one of the worst of these

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
is what it does to our standing in the world

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
if other countries think that everything we do is about oil,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
if we have to treat countries that have oil

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
differently than countries that don't have oil.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And our military get quite unhappy

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
when what they actually signed up for

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
was to protect American citizens.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They don't like fighting over oil,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they don't like being in the sands

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and they don't like where the oil money goes

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and what sort of instability it creates.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now, in order to avoid these problems,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
whatever you think they're worth, it's actually not that complicated.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And then we can replace the other half

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And compared with the official forecast,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which is half of what we've been paying lately,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars:

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
half of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
In the process, we will gain about a million good jobs, mainly rural.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So that's a very handsome return.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It's financeable in the private capital market.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to happen sooner and with higher confidence,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
then you might like some light-handed public policies

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And these policies work fine without taxes, subsidies or mandates.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
They make a little net money for the treasury.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They have a broad trans-ideological appeal,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and because we want them actually to happen,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
we figured out ways to do them

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that do not require much, if any, federal legislation,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and can, indeed, be done administratively or at a state level.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
namely, light vehicles,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You can sort of have it all with these things.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
For example, this Opel two-seater

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and taking out weight so you can put it into payload.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Then you can go even further, almost tripling efficiency

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
with some operational improvements,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
double the big haulers' margins.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
In the airplane business, it's again a similar story

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But then the next generation of planes saves about half.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
kind of a flying wing with internal engines,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
at comparable or lower cost.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
because we all know the most about those;

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
probably everybody here drives one.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
of all the fuel energy you feed into the car,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
seven-eighths never gets to the wheels;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the power train and accessories.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So then of the energy that does get to the wheels,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
or to heat the air the car pushes aside.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And only this little bit, only six percent

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
actually ends up accelerating the car

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and then heating the brakes when you stop.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
In fact, since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This is not very gratifying

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
after more than a century of devoted engineering effort.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(Laughter)

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Applause)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Moreover, three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
getting that energy to the wheels.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
is there was a common assumption in the industry that --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and it would cost a lot more to make,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
in sporting goods.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
The Golf was totaled.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the entire crash energy would be absorbed

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
weighing a total of 15 pounds, hidden in the front end.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Because these materials could actually absorb

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and do so a lot more smoothly.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We could make cars bigger, which is protective, but make them light.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And when you make them light in the right way,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that can be simpler and cheaper to make.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
You can end up saving money, and lives, and oil, all at the same time.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I showed here two years ago

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
(Laughter)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
-- and this is a complete virtual design

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that is production-costed manufacturable.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And the process needed to make it

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is actually coming toward the market quite nicely.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and then ways to thermoform it,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
because it's a combination of carbon and nylon,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
into whatever complex shapes you want,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
They snap together like a kid's toy.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So you got rid of the body shop.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The plant also gets smaller.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you find that of the 28 million barrels a day

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the government says we will need in 2025,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
instead of 26 for buying the oil.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So much, in fact, that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
from areas already approved,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you have only this little bit left, and let's see how we can meet that,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We could, of course, buy more efficiency.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Or wait to capture the second half of it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
we'd get rid of the domestic oil too.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And that doesn't even count, for example,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So we have lots of options.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Now, to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
there is a few ways government could help.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
For example, fee-bates, a combination of a fee and a rebate

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in any size class of vehicle you want,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
can increase the price of inefficient vehicles

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You're not paid to change size class.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
rather than just the first two or three.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
This expands choice rapidly in the market,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and actually makes more money for automakers as well.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
to get efficient, reliable, warranted new cars

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that they could otherwise never get.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And for each car so financed, scrap almost one clunker,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
preferably the dirtiest ones.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
from customers they weren't going to get otherwise,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And Detroit will make money on every unit.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It turns out that if, say, African-American and white households

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
had the same car ownership,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
it would cut employment disparity about in half

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
by providing better access to job opportunities.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So this is a huge social win, too.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that's worth stretching further for.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
they desperately need to cut their fuel bills,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
there are ways to finance it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
they would waste more oil,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and block the uptake of efficient, new planes.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Those part inefficient planes

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
are worth more to society dead than alive.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We ought to take them out back and shoot them,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and put bounty hunters after them.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Then there's an important military role.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
That in creating the move to high-volume,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
or for that matter, ultra-light steels

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that are a good backup technology,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
the military can do the trick it did

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
in turning DARPAnet into the Internet.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Just turn it over to the private sector, and we have an Internet.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
The same for GPS.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
That is, military science and technology that they need

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and advancing national and global security.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and get out of our own way in other ways.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
But here's how the whole thing fits together.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Instead of official forecasts of oil use

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and oil imports going forever up,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
In this eight-year period, 1977 to 85, when we last paid attention,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
the economy grew 27 percent, oil use fell 17 percent,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
oil imports fell 50 percent, oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Well, that was with very old technologies and delivery methods.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We could rerun that play a lot better now.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Ours is on the demand side.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter)

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
(Applause)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Whatever your reason for wanting to do this,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility --

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
(Laughter)

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
-- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
it seems to me that this is an oil endgame

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that we should all be playing to win.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Please download your copy, and thank you very much.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
(Applause)
