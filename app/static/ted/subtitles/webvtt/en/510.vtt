00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am going to talk about myself,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which I rarely do, because I --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So it's actually drearier than self-love;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it's unrequited self-love.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But I want to, though, explain

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because I've been through so many different forms of it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I started with improvisation,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which had one rule,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you could only build on it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And of course we live in a society that's all about

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
contradicting other peoples' reality.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's all about contradiction,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I see it everywhere.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that in public opinion polls

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
is always two percent.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
75 percent of Americans

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
think Alaska is part of Canada.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But only two percent don't know the effect

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
seems a contradiction.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Buying it from us screams good taste."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"Don't use big words."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
"Learn the lingua franca."

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
(Laughter)

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And I suppose it's a contradiction that I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
talk about science when I don't know math.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
for pointing out that one of the reasons,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that there are cultural reasons

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I was taught to do math and read at the same time.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and it becomes rapidly obvious

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that there are only two kinds of men in the world:

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
dwarves and Prince Charmings.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Laughter)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Laughter)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Of course, by talking about science

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I also may, as I did the other night,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
incur the violent wrath of some scientists

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
who were very upset with me.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And they got very upset.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in a serious argument.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But I don't engage in serious arguments.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I don't approve of them

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well rationality is constructed

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that mind-body split, you know?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The head is good, body bad.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Head is ego, body id.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
"I think therefore I am," --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
we mean the head.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
"I ain't got no body."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
That's how you get rationality.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And that's why so much of humor

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is the body asserting itself against the head.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
whacking Richard in the genital area.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And we're laughing doubly then

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
because he's the body, but it's also --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Voice offstage: Richard.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Richard. Yes but it's also the head,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the head of the conference.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That's the other way that humor --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
which is, as much as we revere the head,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
we are very anti-intellectual.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I know this because I read in the New York Times,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
after September 11,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the problem in this country, facing this country

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is the university professors and their spawn."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Laughter)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I don't know how many of you have read it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
(Laughter)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"The act of a master

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
taking painful contemptuous possession of her,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
was the kind of rapture she wanted.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
When they lay together in bed it was,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
an act of violence.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The agony as an act of passion."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So you can imagine my surprise

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
on reading in The New Yorker

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
(Laughter)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
(Laughter)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
"Whip inflation now."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
(Laughter)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which is objectivity.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Objectivity basically is constructed

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
in that same S&amp;M way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's the subject subjugating the object.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
That's how you assert yourself.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You make yourself the active voice.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And the object is the passive no-voice.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I don't know if you know this but --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
but in many hospital nurseries across the country,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the signs over the little boys cribs read,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
"I'm a boy,"

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and the signs over the little girls cribs read,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
"It's a girl." Yeah.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So the passivity was culturally

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
projected onto the little girls.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
There's a poll that proves --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with a woman you actively disliked?"

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And well, yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Well, 58 percent said yes,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
which I think is overinflated though

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
because so many men if you just say,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
They don't even wait for the rest of it.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
(Laughter)

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That's the first callback,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
of my attempted quadruple.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So this subject-object thing,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
is part of something I'm very interested in

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I do. I think it can go too far.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
(Laughter)

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Maybe too far. But you know --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I don't think that

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
a person of color making fun of white people

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
which is why you don't see me making fun of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
What's funny about being down to four houses?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And I really learned this lesson

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Or as I call them, the good ol' days.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and everything else,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Basically, they were making fun of them for being

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
trailer trash or white trash.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and that you're not really hurting anybody.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
"For sale: White trash compactor."

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Laughter)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So this whole subject-object thing

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
has relevance to humor in this way.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."


00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And she says that Roman humor

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
mirrors the construction of Roman society.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So that Roman society was very top/bottom,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
as ours is to some degree.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And so was humor.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
There always had to be the butt of a joke.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So it was always the satirist,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
like Juvenal or Martial,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
represented the audience,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and he was going to make fun of the outsider,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the person who didn't share that subject status.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And in stand-up of course,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
A lot of heckling is the tension

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of trying to make sure that the

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
comedian is going to be able to dominate,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and overcome the heckler.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But I always hated it because they were

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
dictating the terms of the interaction,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the same way that engaging in a serious argument

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
determines the content, to some degree,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of what you're talking about.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I was looking for a form

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that didn't have that.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I know that word is so debased now

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
by the use of it by Internet marketers.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Laughter)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I used to actually hang up on them.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So the next time that one called

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
"You sound sexy."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
(Laughter)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He hung up on me!

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
(Laughter)

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But the interactivity allows the audience

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
to shape what you're going to do as much as

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
you shape their experience of the world.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And that's really what I'm looking for.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
what exactly it is that I do,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I mean he had laid it all out.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And then coming to this conference,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I realized that most everybody here

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
shared those same qualities

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
because really what trickster is

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is an agent of change.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Trickster is a change agent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And the qualities that I'm about to describe

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
are the qualities that make it possible

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to make change happen.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And one of these is boundary crossing.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
But I like to cross boundaries.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Phone Ringing)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I hope that's my agent,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
because you aren't paying me anything.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Laughter)

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I'm able to see the contradiction

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that you may not be able to see.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Like for instance a mime once --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
or a meme as he called himself.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
He was a very selfish meme.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And he said that I had to show more respect

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because it took up to 18 years

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to learn how to do mime properly.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
(Laughter)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
(Applause)

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And you know people, this is the problem with

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
quote, objectivity, unquote.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
When you're only surrounded by people

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
who speak the same vocabulary as you,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or share the same set of assumptions as you,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
you start to think that that's reality.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Well, look at Michael Hawley,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
or look at Dean Kamen,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
or look at my grandmother.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
whether they wanted her to or not.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Laughter)

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
my grandmother would have lost on purpose.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
"No, you take the prize.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Laughter)

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So that's one -- this boundary crossing,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
this go-between which --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Fritz Lanting, is that his name,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
actually said that he was a go-between.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
That's an actual quality of the trickster.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And this is instead of contradiction.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Where you deny the other person's reality,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
you have paradox

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
where you allow more than one reality to coexist,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I think there's another philosophical construction.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I'm not sure what it's called.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Laughter)

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
(Laughter)

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
around five, if that's OK with you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
(Laughter)

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And another attribute of the trickster

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
is smart luck.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
this is another quality of the trickster.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That, and I will say this to the scientists,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that the trickster has the ability to hold

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
his ideas lightly

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
so that he can let room in for new ideas

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
with his ideas.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I had no joke for that.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
(Laughter)

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
But here's how I think I like to make change,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
and that is in making connections.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
This is what I tend to see

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
almost more than contradictions.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
You know, the toes of the gecko,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I love connections.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Like I'll read that one of the two attributes

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
of matter in the Newtonian universe --

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
(Laughter)

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And the other one though is impenetrability.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
was the criterion of masculinity.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Masculinity depended on you

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
being the active penetrator.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And then, in economics, there's an active producer

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and a passive consumer,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
which explains why business always has to

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
penetrate new markets.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
to open her markets.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And didn't that feel good?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
(Laughter)

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And now we're being penetrated.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and planting their little flags on our genes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
You know we're being penetrated.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
(Laughter)

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
That's the second of the quadruple.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I still have a way to go.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
(Laughter)

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
is short circuit people's thinking.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
You know, make you not follow your usual

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
train of association,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
but make you rewire.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000
it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
the woman in that joke about --

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And the mother is elderly.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And the mother goes right through a red light.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And the mother goes through a second red light.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
(Laughter)

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And that's the shock of recognition

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
at the shock of recognition.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
That completes the quadruple.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
(Laughter)

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I just want to say two more things.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
One is, another characteristic of trickster

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
is that the trickster has to

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
walk this fine line.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
He has to have poise.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And you know the biggest hurdle for me,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
in doing what I do,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
is constructing my performance

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
so that it's prepared and unprepared.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Finding the balance between those things

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
is always dangerous

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
But being too prepared doesn't leave room

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
for the accidents to happen.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
said yesterday about beauty

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
because in his book, Hyde says that

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
But to do that you have to

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
lose all the other qualities

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
because once you're into beauty

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
you're into a finished thing.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
You're into something that

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
occupies space and inhabits time.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
It's an actual thing.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
But if you don't do that,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
When you go into beauty the probability wave

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
collapses into one possibility.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And I like to explore all the possibilities

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
that he doesn't have a home.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
He's always on the road.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I want to say to you Richard, in closing,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
that in TED you've created a home.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And thank you for inviting me into it.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
(Applause)
