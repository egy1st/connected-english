00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one, the rise of a culture of availability;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and two, a request.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we're seeing a rise of this availability

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
being driven by mobile device proliferation,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
globally, across all social strata.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
an expectation of availability.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And, with that, comes the third point,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the problem is, we're still working through,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
from a societal standpoint,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
how we allow people to be available.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's a significant delta, in fact,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
between what we're willing to accept.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Apologies to Hans Rosling --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but the big delta there

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to cover up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This first one's called "the lean."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and then quickly checking the device.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
"The stretch."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm going to check my device."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But the guy, here, on the right,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
he's doing the stretch.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to get that device just below the tabletop.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Nothing says "I love you"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Or, this one, coming to us from India.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You can find this on YouTube,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
while text messaging.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That is actually the device.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What this is doing is, we find a --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a direct collision --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we find a direct collision between availability --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and what's possible through availability --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the need to create shared narratives.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We're very good at creating personal narratives,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And when you're standing with someone,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and you're on your mobile device,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
effectively what you're saying to them is,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
"You are not as important as, literally,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
almost anything that could come to me through this device."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Look around you.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There might be somebody on one right now,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
participating in multi-dimensional engagement.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Our reality right now is less interesting

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
than the story we're going to tell about it later.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This one I love.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This poor kid, clearly a prop --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
don't get me wrong, a willing prop --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is the sound of one hand clapping.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, as we lose the context of our identity,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
it becomes incredibly important

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
becomes the context in which we live.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
becomes who we are.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
People aren't simply projecting identity,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
they're creating it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We are creating the technology

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that is going to create the new shared experience,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which will create the new world.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And so my request is,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
please, let's make technologies

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that make people more human,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and not less.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Thank you.
