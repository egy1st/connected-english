00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So how would you run a whole country without oil?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That's the question that sort of hit me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It never left my brain.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So I went out and researched ethanol,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is, you actually use more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
clean electrons than the ones you get

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
inside a car, if you use hydrogen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So that is not going to be the path to go.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then sort of through a process of

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
wandering around, I got to the thought

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in a way that is convenient and affordable,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you could get to a solution.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now I started this from a point of view that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it has to be something that scales en masse.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Not how do you build one car,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but how do you scale this so that it can become

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
something that is used by 99 percent of the population?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
as any car that you would have today.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we're bound with the laws of physics

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and the laws of economics.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And so the thought that I started with was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
how do you do this, still within the boundary

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of the science we know today --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or waiting for the magic battery to show up.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
How do you do it within the economics that we have today?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And not from the power of an edict down.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I actually found out that the answer comes

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
from separating between the car ownership

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and the battery ownership.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
"batteries not included."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now if you separate between the two,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you could actually answer the need for a convenient car

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by creating a network,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
by creating a network before the cars show up.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The network has two components in them.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And so the first thought that came to mind is,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
everywhere we park we have electric power.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
like Scandinavia, you already have that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now that last mile,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
last foot, in a sense,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is the first step of the infrastructure.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of the range extension.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
reasonable space and weight limitations.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But you never want to get stuck.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So what we added is a second element to our network,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
which is a battery swap system.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
within two minutes you're back on the road

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and you can go again.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you had charge spots everywhere,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and you had battery swap stations everywhere,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
how often would you do it? And it ends up

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
we start paying you money

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because it's an inconvenience.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Then we looked at the question of the affordability.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
disconnected from the car.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
What is the cost of that battery?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
something interesting happens.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You have the crude oil.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
as what we call petrol or gasoline.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
as the gas tank.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
step after step after step.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And so it's sort of a mini well.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
In a sense what we've done is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
we've created a new consumable.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You, today, buy gasoline miles.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And we created electric miles.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Today 2010, in volume,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in the average consumer

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
environment we're in in the U.S.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In Europe where taxes are in place,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to four cents a mile in 2015,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to two cents a mile by 2020.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So in a sense this is

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
by 2020, which is our desire.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That is an 80 cent gallon.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
would convert to crude oil,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
they still can't compete with two cents a mile.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
That's a new economic factor,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
which is fascinating to most people.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Now this would have been a wonderful paper.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And some governments told me that it's fascinating

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that the younger generation actually thinks about these things.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Laughter)

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Until I got to the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
200 million dollars,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and if you can find a car company

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that will build that car in mass volume,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Peres thought that was a great idea.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We sent letters to all the car companies.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
He said hybrids are like mermaids.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
When you want a fish you get a woman and

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
when you need a woman you get a fish.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
(Laughter)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And Ghosn came up and said,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that will come into the market in mass volume --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's the first mass-volume electric car,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
zero-emission electric car in the market.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I was running, as Chris said,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that you would go and do?"

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We then decided to scale it up.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And Denmark set this beautiful policy;

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
it's called the IQ test.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It's inversely proportional to taxes.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and zero tax on zero-emission cars.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Laughter)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
We then were sort of coined as the guys

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
who run only in small islands.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
(Laughter)

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's got three centers --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The next island

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We decided to come into the U.S.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and pick the two best places --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the one where you didn't need any range extension.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And if you really have a long day you can switch,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and keep on driving around the island.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
He decided that he's going to take over

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the state, unofficially, and then officially,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and then created this beautiful Region One policy.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the highest concentration of Priuses,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but you also have the perfect range extender.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It's called the other car.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
As we stared scaling it up

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Why is this a big issue?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
when you have small problems on the individual level,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
you're dead. Alright?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So the price of oil, much like

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
lots of other curves that we've seen,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
goes along a depletion curve.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You think, well it's been up, it's been down,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Here is the problem:

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Now we're running a stimulus package.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
somewhere in that space.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
What happens when the economy recovers?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
even at the pace we're going at right now.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
That is another 25 million barrels a day.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That's all the U.S. usage today.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
also known as 200 dollars a barrel.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
We take our money and we give it away.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
You know what happens at that point?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And the downs are going to be much longer

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and the ups are going to be much shorter.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And that's the difference between problems that are additive,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and problems that are depletive,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
in which we lose what we have,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
which oscillate, and they oscillate until

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
we lose everything we've got.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Right? Remember in the campaign: one million

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
hybrid cars by 2015.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That won't do much difference.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We looked at an MIT study:

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
ten million electric cars on the global roads.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It's also the most optimistic number

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
because it means we will scale this industry

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
from 100 thousand cars is 2011,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to 10 million cars by 2016 --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
100 x growth in less than five years.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We have 10 million cars by region.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
That's an enormous amount of cars.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
China is adding those cars --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
India, Russia, Brazil.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We have all these regions.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They'll be the first in line to get off

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because their prices are high.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We don't have the industry set right.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
across the U.S.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now where is the car industry on that?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we'll solve everything within the car itself."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
No infrastructure, no problem.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We forgot about the entire chain around us.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
All this stuff that happens around.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
a whole new market, a whole new business model.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to drive the car --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the minutes, the miles if you want,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
that you are all familiar with --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
subsidize the price of the car,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And some of it will go back to the car maker.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
from windmills, not from oil.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in the south of Israel.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
instead of digging down.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
These are perfect matches to one another.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Now all you need is about 10 percent

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
of the electricity generated.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That's one percent a year.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Now when we're looking at solving big problems,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
we need to start thinking in two numbers.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and scale it infinity.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that are willing to go to this kind of scale.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
One car emits four tons.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And actually 700 and change million cars today

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We have to come and attack this problem

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
with a focus, with an effort that actually says,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
we're going to go to zero before the world ends.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I told him one of the reasons that

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
his uncle was remembered

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and we'll do it by the end of the decade.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
(Laughter)

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
there was a long argument

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
over economy versus morality.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
25 percent of their energy

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
for the entire industrial world in the U.K.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
came from a source of energy that was immoral:

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
human slaves.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And what would it do to our economy?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and keep the slaves.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
We have to make the right moral decision.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
We have to make it immediately.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
We need to have presidential leadership

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
but within this presidential term

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
because if we don't, we will lose our economy,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
right after we'd lost our morality.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Thank you all very much.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:41.000
(Applause)
