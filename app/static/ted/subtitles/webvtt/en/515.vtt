00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm just going to talk --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
about where that's likely to carry us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you know, I saw all the visions

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of the first couple of sessions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about the future.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It felt wrong to do that in some way.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And yet, I don't really think it is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because when it comes down to it,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
what people in the future are going to remember about this period.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I want to talk to you a little bit about

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm focusing on biology,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the biological sciences.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the areas that are the most significant to us.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The reason for that is really very simple.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's because we're flesh and blood.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We're biological creatures.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And what we can do with our biology

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is going to shape our future

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and that of our children and that of their children --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
whether we gain control over aging,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and heart disease, and cancer.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He said, "And so from hour to hour

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we ripe and ripe.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And thereby hangs a tale."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Life is short, you know.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And we need to think about planning a little bit.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
going to have to lose everything that we love.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
When you're beginning to rot a little bit,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
all of the videos crammed into your head,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
all of the extensions that extend your various powers,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
are going to being to seem a little secondary.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so is Eric Drexler.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This is where it's really central to our lives.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
about our power to control biology.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It wasn't two years ago

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that everybody was talking about --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we've found the Holy Grail of biology.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We're deciphering the code of codes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We're reading the book of life.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we'll look back at this instant in time,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and all of the sort of talk about

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the Human Genome Project,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and what all this is going to mean to us --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
well, it will really mean precious little.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
we're talking about changing ourselves.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And this is very critical stuff.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
you just have to go to any major city.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is not the stomping ground

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of our Pleistocene ancestors.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What's happening is we're taking this technology --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
it's becoming more precise, more potent --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and we're turning it back upon ourselves.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Before it's all done

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we are going to alter ourselves

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's going to happen a lot sooner

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
than people imagine.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
On the way there it's going to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's going to change the way we have children.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's going to change the way we manage

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and alter our emotions.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's going to probably change the human lifespan.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It will really make us question

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
what it is to be a human being.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
The larger context of this is that are

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The first of them is the obvious one,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the silicon revolution,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which you all are very, very familiar with.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It's changing our lives in so many ways,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and it will continue to do that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What the essence of that is, is that we're taking

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and we're breathing a level of complexity into it

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that rivals that of life itself,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and may even surpass it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
is the revolution in biology.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The genomics revolution,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
proteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
What we're doing is we are

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
seizing control of our evolutionary future.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I mean we're essentially using technology

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to just jam evolution into fast-forward.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's not at all clear where it's going to take us.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But in five to ten years we're going to start see

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
some very profound changes.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The most immediate changes that we'll see

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
are things like in medicine.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
as we start to be able to identify

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But who is going to pay for all this?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And how are we going to understand all this complex information?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That is going to be the IT challenge

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
of the next generation, is communicating all this information.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
There's pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and genetics:

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That's going to have amazing impacts.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And it's going to be used for diet as well,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and nutritional supplements and such.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But it's going to have a big impact because

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
we're going to have niche drugs.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And we aren't going to be able to support

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It's too slow.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's too risk-averse.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And it is really not suited for the future

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that we're moving into.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's really wonderful when we hear,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?"

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And look around you and know

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that what we really care about is

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that little bit of difference.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but not to each other

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
because we compete with each other all time.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and between subpopulations of humans as well.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
A generation or so away

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Now I don't mean extra gills or something --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
something we care about, like aging.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
What if we could unravel aging and understand it --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
begin to retard the process or even reverse it?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It would change absolutely everything.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it's obvious to anyone,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
whatever the consequences are.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The second is modifying our emotions.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I mean Ritalin, Viagra,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
things of that sort, Prozac.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
What if you could take a little

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
concoction of pharmaceuticals

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that would make you feel really contented,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
just happy to be you.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Probably not.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And if you don't, who are you going to be?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Why do you do what you do?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It's going to be very challenging to deal with.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The third area is reproduction.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and the challenges it's going to present to society.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
There are three obvious ways of doing this.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The first is cloning.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It didn't happen.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It's a total media circus.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It will happen in five to 10 years.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The birth of a delayed identical twin

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is not going to shake western civilization.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But there are more important things that are already occurring:

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
embryo screening.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You take a six to eight cell embryo,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and depending on the results of that test

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
you either implant that embryo or you discard it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's already done to avoid rare diseases today.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And pretty soon it's going to be possible

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
As that becomes possible

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
this is going to move from something that is used by those who

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to the wealthy who want to protect their children,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to just about everybody else.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And in that process that's going to morph

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
from being just for diseases,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to being for lesser vulnerabilities,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
like risk of manic depression or something,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to picking personalities,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The way I suspect it will happen

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
is using artificial chromosomes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to 47 or 48.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And one that is not heritable

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
because who would want to pass on to their children

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the archaic enhancement modules

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They'll want the new release.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Those kinds of loose analogies with

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
(Laughter)

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
computers, and with programming,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
are actually much deeper than that.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
They are really going to come to operate in this realm.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Now not everything that can be done should be done.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And it won't be done.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But when something is feasible in thousands of

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
laboratories all over the world,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which is going to be the case with these technologies,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
which is already the case,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and when they're almost impossible to police,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
it's not a question of if this is going to happen,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
it's when and where and how it's going to happen.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Humanity is going to go down this path.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it's going to do so for two reasons.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The first is that all these technologies

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that everybody wants to see happen.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It is being funded very very --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in a big way.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The second is, we're human.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
That's what we do.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
We try and use our technology to

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
improve our lives in one way or another.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
when they become available,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
is as much a denial of who we are

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
as to imagine

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that we'll use these technologies and not fret

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and worry about it a great deal.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The lines are going to blur. And they already are

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
between therapy and enhancement,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
between treatment and prevention,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
between need and desire.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
That's really the central one, I believe.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
People can try and ban these things.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
They undoubtedly will. They have.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But ultimately all this is going to do

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is just shift development elsewhere.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's going to drive these things from view.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
because they are in the best position

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it's going to deny us

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
the information that we need to make wise decisions

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
about how to use these technologies.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So, sure, we need to debate these things.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And I think it's wonderful that we do.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But we shouldn't kid ourselves

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
That is simply not going to happen.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They touch us too deeply.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Some people are going to see this

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
as an abomination,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
as the worst thing, as just awful.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Other people are going to say, "This is great.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
This is the flowering of human endeavor."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
The one thing though that is really dangerous

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
about these sorts of technologies,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is that it's easy to become seduced by them.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And to focus too much on all

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the high-technology possibilities that exist.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And to lose touch

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is going to keep them, save them,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
from overeating,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
from eating a lot of fast foods,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
from not getting any exercise.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
It's not going to happen.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
In the midst of all this amazing technology,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
like to brand as non-science.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But this whole effort is generated,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
is driven, by IT as well

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
because that is how we're gathering all this information,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and linking it, and integrating it together.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And that's where about half of our drugs come.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So we shouldn't dismiss this

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
because it's an enormous opportunity to use

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
these sorts of results,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
or these random loose trials from the last thousand years

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
about what has impacts on our health.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And to use our advanced technologies

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to pull out what is beneficial from this

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
sea of noise, basically.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
In fact this isn't just abstract.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I just formed a biotechnology company

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that is using

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
this sort of an approach to develop

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and we're making some real progress.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So here we are.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's the beginning of a new millennium.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
If you look forward,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I mean future humans,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
far before the end of this millennium,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And from the beginning of today's sessions

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
difficult, painful period

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that we struggled through.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I don't think that's what's going to happen.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
They are going to think about it

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
as this glorious instant

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
when we laid down

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the very foundations of their lives,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
of their society, of their future.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You know it's a little bit like a birth.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And then what comes out of it? New life.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Actually as was pointed out earlier,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So to me,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
it's clear that one of the foundations of that future

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
is going to be the reworking of our biology.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We're going to make lots of errors.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
That's the way these things work.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
To me it's an incredible privilege

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to be alive now

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and to be able to witness this thing.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
It is something that is a unique instant

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
in the history of all of life.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It will always be remembered.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And what's extraordinary is that

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
we're not just observing this,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
we are the architects of this.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I think that we should be proud of it.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What is so difficult and challenging

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
is that we are also the objects of these changes.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
who would pull back in fear.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I think that our choice

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
in the choice of life,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
is not whether we're going to go down this path.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
We are, definitely.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
It's how we hold it in our hearts.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
It's how we look at it.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
"The bravest are surely those

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
who have the clearest vision of what is before them,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
both glory and danger alike.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it."

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thank you.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(Applause)
