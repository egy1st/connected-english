00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in an echo-free chamber.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Think of the AlloSphere as a large,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
dynamically varying digital microscope

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that's connected to a supercomputer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
20 researchers can stand on a bridge

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
suspended inside of the sphere, and be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
completely immersed in their data.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Imagine if a team of physicists

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
could stand inside of an atom

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and watch and hear electrons spin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Imagine if a group of sculptors

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
could be inside of a lattice of atoms

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and sculpt with their material.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
into the brain, as though it was a world,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and see tissues as landscapes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and hear blood density levels as music.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is some of the research that you're going to see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But first a little bit about this group

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of artists, scientists, and engineers

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that are working together.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and the inventor of the AlloSphere.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
With my visual artist colleagues, we map

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
visually and sonically.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the information.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And our engineering colleagues are making

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for this kind of data exploration.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm going to fly you into five research projects

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
biological macroscopic data

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
all the way down to electron spin.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This first project is called the AlloBrain.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
by finding which regions of the brain

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Our narrative here is real fMRI data

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that's mapped visually and sonically.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You see 12 intelligent computer agents,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They're mining blood density levels.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Higher density levels mean

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
more activity in that point of the brain.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They're actually singing these densities to you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We're now going to move from real biological data

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in our next artistic and scientific installation.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
are helping us to understand

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
self-generation and growth:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
For artists, we're making new worlds

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that we can uncover and explore.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
These generative algorithms grow over time,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Our researchers are interacting with this data

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by injecting bacterial code,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
which are computer programs,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that allow these creatures to grow over time.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We're going to move now from the biological

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the macroscopic world,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
down into the atomic world,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as we fly into a lattice of atoms.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
They've discovered a new bond,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a new material for transparent solar cells.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You view the bond in the triangle.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's four blue zinc atoms

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
bonding with one white hydrogen atom.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You see the electron flow with the streamlines

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we as artists have generated for the scientists.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The sound that you're hearing are the actual

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
emission spectrums of these atoms.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We've mapped them into the audio domain,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
so they're singing to you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We're going to actually move even further down

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
as we go from this lattice of atoms

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to one single hydrogen atom.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're working with our physicist colleagues

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that have given us the mathematical calculations

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of the n-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation in time.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The white dots are the probability wave

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that will show you where the electron is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in any given point of time and space

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in this particular three-orbital configuration.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and you're going to notice a pulsing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
This is actually a light emitter.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
As the sound starts to pulse and contract,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They're starting to find new mathematical structures

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
in these calculations.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We're going to move even further down,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and go to one single electron spin.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
This will be the final project that I show you.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
decoherence in a single electron spin.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
We've taken this information and we've

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
made a mathematical model out of it.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
You're actually seeing and hearing

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
quantum information flow.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
This is very important for the next step in simulating

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
quantum computers and information technology.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So these brief examples that I've shown you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to bring together, arts, science

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and engineering

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
into a new age of math, science and art.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Applause)
