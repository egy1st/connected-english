00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and not without reason.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I had a very charming routine at the time,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which was to wait until late in the evening

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
scream at the top of my lungs and run out

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because I was the Incredible Hulk.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Obviously, you see the resemblance.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this routine went on for some time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When I was seven I went to summer camp.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And at noon each day

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the campers would go to a pond,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
where they had floating docks.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You could jump off the end into the deep end.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was born premature. I was always very small.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I've always had buoyancy problems.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So water was something that scared me to begin with.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But I would go in on occasion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And on one particular day,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So I dove through the inner tube,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I tried to come up for air,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That is something that I did not get over.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My inability to swim has been

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But there is a happy ending to this story.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At age 31 -- that's my age now --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And went from swimming one lap --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I measured it --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to going to Montauk on Long Island,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
close to where I grew up,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And I came out,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in my Speedos, European style,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a world-class language learner,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and a tango champion.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I would like to share my art.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that really scare the living hell out of me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So, moving onward.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Swimming, first principles.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
First principles, this is very important.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I find that the best results in life

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the turnaround in swimming came

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So the clock started ticking.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I started seeking out triathletes

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I tried kickboards.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
My feet would slice through the water like razors,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Hand paddles, everything.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And he introduced me to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So here are the new rules of swimming,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The problem is hydrodynamics.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So what you want to focus on instead

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The only way you can do that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is to not swim on top of the water.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
at least, submerged naturally.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So you end up, number three,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But actually rotating from streamlined right

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to streamlined left,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And you can see that he's extending his right arm

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
below his head and far in front.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And so his entire body really is underwater.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The arm is extended below the head.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The head is held in line with the spine,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Here is an example of the stroke.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You can see this is the left extension.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Then you see his left leg.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Small flick, and the only purpose of that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Rather, he is entering the water

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Not their fault, honestly.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Below is what most swimmers

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
will find enables them to do what I did,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to 11 strokes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to turn with body roll,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And that will get you very far.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
That's it. That's really all you need to know.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Languages. Material versus method.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I, like many people, came to the conclusion

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that I was terrible at languages.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and the sum total of my knowledge

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
all things considered.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
My first evening, before my first day of school,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I said to my mother, very politely,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So, (Japanese)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
(Laughter)

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
(Laughter)

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I walked in to school.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
because it was Kanji,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Asked him what this said.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Traditional Japanese." And so on.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And so it came to me in waves.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There had been something lost in translation.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And that's pretty much my response.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
(Laughter)

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Nothing worked until I found this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
As soon as I focused on this material,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I took off.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and have continued to apply this material

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Someone who was terrible at languages,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This brings us to the point,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You can also do this with grammar.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
will show you subject, object, verb,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
From that point, you can then, if you want to,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And now I love languages.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
very important.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But no, you'd be wrong

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And so I ended up walking like this.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Not very good for ballroom dancing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I found myself in Argentina in 2005,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Went in, paid my ten pesos,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The instructor says, "You are participating."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Immediately: death sweat.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Laughter)

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that it exploded in my face,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
never to return to the ballroom dancing club.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
"Okay, come on, grab me."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Gorgeous assistant instructor.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And she pulled back, threw down her arms,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Laughter)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
which I found encouraging.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
"Of Mice and Men" style.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And she looked up and said,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
"Now that's better."

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So I bought a month's worth of classes.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And proceeded to look at --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Parkinson's Law,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I got a female instructor first,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to teach me the female role, the follow,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
along with her, of the

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I compared the two lists,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and what you find is that there is explicitly,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
expertise they recommended, certain training methods.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Then there were implicit commonalities

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
that none of them seemed to be practicing.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the tango dancers will use very short steps.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So you can have --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and you can do it in a very small space in fact.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Secondly, different types of pivots.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Thirdly, variation in tempo.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
That photo is of the

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Then one month later, went to the world championships,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
two weeks later.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I want you to see part of what I practiced.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I'm going to jump forward here.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
His name is Gabriel Misse.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and his pivots.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now what I like about this video

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the strength in my feet, to do that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So he uses a lead that focuses on

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
his shoulder girdle and his arm.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
That's just one benefit of that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So then we broke it down.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
This would be an example of one pivot.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
This is a back step pivot.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
There are many different types.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I have hundreds of hours of footage --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
all categorized, much like George Carlin

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
categorized his comedy.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So using my arch-nemesis,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And the best results that I've had in life,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
what's the worst that can happen?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Take the analytical frameworks,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Apply them to very big dreams.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
When I imagine my life,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
what my life would have been like

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
without the educational opportunities that I had,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
it makes me wonder.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
the American public school system,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to either fix it or replace it.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
my readers, at this point.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And if any of you are interested in that,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I would love to speak with you.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(Applause)
