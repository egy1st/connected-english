00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Most of them are pretty basic.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Number one: don't let go --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
very sure success method.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But really, truly -- often you think about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
letting go way before your body does.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So hang in there,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Number two: hesitation is bad.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in the Yosemite high country.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The most friction you have is when you first put your hand

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or your foot on the rock.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And then from that point on, you're basically falling.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So momentum is good. Don't stop.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Rule number three: have a plan.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a climb called the Naked Edge,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This climber is on the last pitch of it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He's actually right about where I fell.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And all the hard pitches are actually below him.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Often what happens is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you're planning so hard for like,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then what happens?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You get to the last pitch. It's easy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But you also can't forget that each individual move

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
you have to be able to complete.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a climb called the Dike Route,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But if you're the leader on it,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
onto some low angle slabs.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So you've got to focus.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You don't want to stop in the middle like

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You've got to keep going.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Rule number five: know how to rest.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's amazing. The best climbers

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
are the ones that in the most extreme situations

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
can get their bodies into some position

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
where they can rest,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
regroup, calm themselves, focus,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and keep going.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Fear really sucks because what it means is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you're not focusing on what you're doing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You're focusing on the consequences of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
failing at what you're doing

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
because any given move should require

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
all your concentration and thought processes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to execute it effectively.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
One of the things in climbing is, most people

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which is a columnar basalt formation

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
With this, typically crack climbers

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
would put their hands in and their toes in

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and just start climbing.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The cracks are too small to get your toes into

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
so the only way to climb is using your fingertips

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in the cracks,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and using opposing pressure

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and forcing yourself up.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the most important thing I've learned

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they get 15 feet up --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And then they just flame out.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Women are much more in balance

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
because they don't have that idea

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They think about how to get the weight over their feet

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So balance is really critical,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and keeping your weight on your feet,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
which is your strongest muscle.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And of course there is rule number nine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I came up with rule number nine after

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I actually didn't plan for a fall,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because that is the critical piece

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of not getting hurt --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
how you're going to fall onto the rope,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or if you're climbing without a rope,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So don't hang on till the bitter end.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Applause)
