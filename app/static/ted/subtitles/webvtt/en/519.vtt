WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here today, as June said,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to talk about a project

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're crocheting a coral reef.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's a project that we've actually

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
have actually been involved in this project,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in many of its different aspects.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's a project that now reaches across three continents,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
marine biology, feminine handicraft

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and environmental activism.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's true.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's also a project

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that in a very beautiful way,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the development of this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
right here in February 2009 --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which, as one of our previous speakers told us,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is the 200th anniversary

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of the birth of Charles Darwin.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But let me first begin by showing you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
some pictures of what this thing looks like.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Just to give you an idea of scale,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that installation there is about six feet across,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is some more images of it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That one on the right is about five feet high.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
have contributed all over the world as part of this.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The totality of this project

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
involves tens of thousands of hours

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
of human labor --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
99 percent of it done by women.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that is about 12 feet long.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My sister and I started this project in 2005

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because in that year, at least in the science press,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
there was a lot of talk about global warming,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Corals are very delicate organisms,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It causes these vast bleaching events

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that are the first signs of corals of being sick.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And if the bleaching doesn't go away --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
particularly in coral reefs all over the world.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which is a little organization we started

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to promote, to do projects about the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
asking for people to join us in this enterprise.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
To our surprise, one of the first people who called

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
was the Andy Warhol Museum.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And they said they were having an exhibition

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
about artists' response to global warming,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you can have a little bit of it."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So in 2007 we had an exhibition,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a small exhibition of this crochet reef.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and we want you to fill it with your reef."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Now I say "naively" because actually

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
my profession is as a science writer.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I've written books about the history of space,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the history of physics and religion,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So I said yes to this proposition.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And she nearly had a fit

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because Christine is a professor at one of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
She thought I'd gone off my head.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But she went into crochet overdrive.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And to cut a long story short, eight months later

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
3,000 square foot gallery.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
By this stage the project had taken on

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
a viral dimension of its own,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
which got completely beyond us.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The people in Chicago decided

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
was have the local people there make a reef.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And it was exhibited alongside ours.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
There were hundreds of people involved in that.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We got invited to do the whole thing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in New York, and in London,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and in Los Angeles.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
In each of these cities, the local citizens,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And more and more people get involved in this,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
most of whom we've never met.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So the whole thing has sort of morphed

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
into this organic, ever-evolving creature,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now some of you are sitting here thinking,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
"What planet are these people on?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
two concepts that go together.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Cast it in bronze."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But it turns out there is a very good reason

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
why we are crocheting it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
because many organisms in coral reefs

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
have a very particular kind of structure.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The frilly crenulated forms that you see

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And the only way that mathematicians know

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
how to model this structure

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So what is this hyperbolic geometry

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that corals and sea slugs embody?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to the level of a sea slug.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
when it was first discovered in the 19th century.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
how they could model it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In 1997 a mathematician

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
at Cornell, Daina Taimina,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
made the discovery that this structure

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
could actually be done in knitting and crochet.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The first one she did was knitting.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
crochet was the better thing.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But what she was doing was actually making a model

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
had thought it was actually impossible to model.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
was impossible per se.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
trying to prove that this structure was impossible.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
about two kinds of space:

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Euclidean space, and spherical space.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And they have different properties.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And what they do is, they do it through the concept

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of parallel lines.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So here we have a line and a point outside the line.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the point but never meet the original line?"

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
One. Great. Okay.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
That's our definition of a parallel line.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's a definition really of Euclidean space.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But there is another possibility that you all know of:

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
spherical space.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Think of the surface of a sphere --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
can I draw through the point

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but never meet the original line?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
What do we mean to talk about

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
a straight line on a curved surface?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now mathematicians have answered that question.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They've understood there is a generalized concept

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
of straightness, it's called a geodesic.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And on the surface of a sphere,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So we ask the question again,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
but never meet the original line?"

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Does someone want to guess?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Zero. Very good.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Zero and one.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
To a mathematician if there are two answers,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and the first two are zero and one,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
there is another number that immediately suggests itself

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
as the third alternative.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Does anyone want to guess what it is?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
There is, there's a third alternative.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
This is what it looks like.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that go through the point and never meet the original line.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is the drawing.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
flat surface.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Mathematicians for several hundred years

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
had to really struggle with this.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
How could they see this?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What did it mean to actually have a physical model

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that looked like this?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Then our mathematicians come along

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and said, "There's this thing called a sphere,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and the lines come together at the north and south pole."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But you don't know what a sphere looks like.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I can touch it. I can play with it."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And that's exactly what happened

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
when Daina Taimina

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in 1997, showed that you could crochet models

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in hyperbolic space.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Here is this diagram in crochetness.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And the lines look curved.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But look, I can prove to you that they're straight

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
because I can take any one of these lines,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and I can fold along it.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And it's a straight line.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So here, in wool,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
through a domestic feminine art,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is the proof that the most famous postulate

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
in mathematics is wrong.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
(Applause)

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
theorems onto these surfaces.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that is called non-Euclidean geometry.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And this is actually the field of mathematics

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that underlies general relativity

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and is actually ultimately going to show us

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
about the shape of the universe.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So there is this direct line

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
between feminine handicraft,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Euclid and general relativity.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
didn't know it was impossible to violate,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and they're simply getting on with it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I once asked the mathematicians why it was

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Their answer was interesting.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
sitting around looking at sea slugs."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It also says a whole lot of things

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
about what mathematicians thought mathematics was,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
what they thought it could and couldn't do,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
what they thought it could and couldn't represent.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Even mathematicians, who in some sense

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
are the freest of all thinkers,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
literally couldn't see

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
not only the sea slugs around them,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
but the lettuce on their plate --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And so in some sense they literally,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
they had such a symbolic view of mathematics,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
they couldn't actually see what was going on

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
on the lettuce in front of them.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And so, too, we've discovered

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that there is an infinite taxonomy

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
of crochet hyperbolic creatures.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
doing the simple mathematically perfect models.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But we found that when we deviated from the specific

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
setness of the mathematical code

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that underlies it -- the simple algorithm

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
crochet three, increase one --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the models immediately started to look more natural.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
collection of people around the world,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
do their own embellishments.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
As it were, we have this ever-evolving,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
crochet taxonomic tree of life.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Just as the morphology

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and the complexity of life on earth is never ending,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
little embellishments and complexifications

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
in the DNA code

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
lead to new and wondrous creatures

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So this project really has

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
taken on this inner organic life of its own.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And their individual visions,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and their engagement with this mathematical mode.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
We have these technologies. We use them.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
is that these things suggest

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the importance and value of embodied knowledge.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We live in a society

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that completely tends to valorize

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
symbolic forms of representation --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
algebraic representations,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
equations, codes.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
We live in a society that's obsessed

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
with presenting information in this way,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
teaching information in this way.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But through this sort of modality,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
crochet, other plastic forms of play --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
people can be engaged with the most abstract,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
high-powered, theoretical ideas,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to university departments to study in higher mathematics,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But you can do it through playing with material objects.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
One of the ways that we've come to think about this

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and projects like this, we're trying to have

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
kindergarten for grown-ups.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
system of education,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
established by a man named Friedrich Froebel,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
He believed that the crystal was the model

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
for all kinds of representation.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
He developed a radical alternative system

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
of engaging the smallest children

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
with the most abstract ideas

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
through physical forms of play.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
The value of education

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
is something that Froebel championed,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
through plastic modes of play.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We live in a society now

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
where we have lots of think tanks,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
where great minds go to think about the world.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
They write these great symbolic treatises

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
called books, and papers,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and op-ed articles.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We want to propose, Chrissy and I,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which is the play tank.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And the play tank, like the think tank,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is a place where people can go

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and engage with great ideas.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
But what we want to propose,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
is that the highest levels of abstraction,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
all of this can be engaged with,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
not just through purely cerebral algebraic

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
symbolic methods,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
but by literally, physically playing with ideas.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
(Applause)
