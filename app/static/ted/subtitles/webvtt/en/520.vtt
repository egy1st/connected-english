00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was five years old

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I fell in love with airplanes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now I'm talking about the '30s.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the '30s an airplane had two wings

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a round motor,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and was always flown

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He had high leather boots,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a wonderful helmet

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and those marvelous goggles --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and, inevitably, a white scarf,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to flow in the wind.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He'd always walk up to his airplane

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in a kind of saunter,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
devil-may-care saunter,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
flick the cigarette away,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And then mount his airplane,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
maybe for the last time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Of course I always wondered what would happen

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
if he'd kissed the airplane first.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But this was real romance to me.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Everything about flying in those years,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
was probably the most advanced

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
technological thing going on at the time.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So as a youngster,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I tried to get close to this

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by drawing airplanes,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
constantly drawing airplanes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's the way I got

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a part of this romance.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And of course, in a way, when I say romance,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean in part

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the aesthetics of that whole situation.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I think the word is the holistic experience

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
revolving around a product.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The product was that airplane.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But it built a romance.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Even the parts of the airplane

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
had French names.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You know, from a romance language.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So that it was something that just got into your spirit.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It did mine.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And I decided I had to get closer than

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
just drawing fantasy airplanes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I wanted to build airplanes.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I built model airplanes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I found that in doing the model airplanes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the appearance drawings were not enough.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You couldn't transfer those

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to the model itself.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If you wanted it to fly

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you had to learn the discipline

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of flying.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You had to learn about aeronautics.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You had to learn what made an airplane

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
stay in the air.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So it had to be self-righting,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and stay up without crashing.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So I had to give up

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the approach of drawing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
the fantasy shapes

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and convert it to technical drawings --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and build an airplane over these drawings

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that I knew followed some of the principles

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of flying.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And in so doing, I could produce

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
a model that would fly, stay in the air.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And it had, once it was in the air,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
some of this romance that I was in love with.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Well the act of drawing airplanes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
led me to,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
when I had the opportunity to choose

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a course in school,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And when I was sitting in classes --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to my surprise.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and all this sort of thing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in the class.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
One day a young man looked over my shoulder,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
he said, "You draw very well.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You should be in the art department."

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And I said, "Why?"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So my romance was temporarily shifted.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
(Laughter)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And I went into art

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because they appreciated drawing.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Went through design,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
some architecture.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Eventually hired myself out as a designer.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And for the following 25 years,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
living in Italy,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
living in America,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I doled out a piece of this romance

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to anybody who'd pay for it --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
this sense, this aesthetic feeling,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
for the experience revolving around

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a designed object.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And it exists.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Any of you who rode the automobiles --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
was it yesterday? --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
at the track, you know the romance

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
revolving around those high performance cars.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Well in 25 years

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I was mostly putting out

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
pieces of this romance

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and not getting a lot back in

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because design on call

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
doesn't always connect you with a circumstance

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in which you can produce things of this nature.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So after 25 years I began to feel

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
as though I was running dry.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And I quit.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I started up a very small operation --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
went from 40 people

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to one,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in an effort to rediscover my innocence.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I wanted to get back

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
where the romance was.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And I couldn't choose airplanes

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
because they had gotten sort of unromantic

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
at that point,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
on the interiors.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I chose furniture.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I chose chairs specifically

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because I knew something about them.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
for tractors and trucks

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and submarines --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
all kinds of things.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But not office chairs.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So I started doing that.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I found that there were ways

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
to duplicate the same approach

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that I used to use on the airplane.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Only this time,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
instead of the product being shaped by the wind,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
it was shaped by the human body.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So the discipline was --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
as in the airplane you learn a lot about

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
how to deal with the air,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
for a chair

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you have to learn a lot about how to deal

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
with the body,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and what the body needs, wants,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
indicates it needs.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And that's the way, ultimately

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
after some ups and downs,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I should say one more thing. When I was doing those

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
model airplanes,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I did everything.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I conceived the kind of airplane.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I basically engineered it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I built it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I flew it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And that's the way I work now.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
When I started this chair

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
it was not a preconceived notion.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Design nowadays, if you mean it,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
you don't start with styling sketches.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I started with a lot of loose ideas,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
roughly eight or nine years ago.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And the loose ideas had something

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
to do with what I knew happened with

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
people in the office,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
at the work place -- people who worked,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and used task seating,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
a great many of them sitting in front of a computer

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
all day long.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I felt,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the one thing they don't need,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
is a chair that interferes

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
with their main reason for sitting there.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So I took the approach

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that the chair should do as much for them

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
as humanly possible

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
or as mechanistically possible

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
so that they didn't have to fuss with it.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So my idea was that,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
instead of sitting down and reaching

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
for a lot of controls,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that you would sit on the chair,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and it would automatically balance your weight

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
against the force required

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to recline.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But you know most good chairs do recline

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
because it's beneficial to open up this joint

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
between your legs and your upper body

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
for better breathing

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and better flow.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So that if you sit down

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
on my chair,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
whether you're five feet tall

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
or six foot six,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
it always deals with your weight

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and transfers the amount of force required

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
to recline

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in a way that you don't have to look

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
for something to adjust.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I'll tell you right up front,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
this is a trade off.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There are drawbacks to this.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
One is: you can't

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
accommodate everybody.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
There are some very light people,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
some extremely heavy people,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
They begin to fall off the end of your chart.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But the compromise, I felt,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
was in my favor

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
because most people don't adjust their chairs.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They will sit in them forever.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
tell me about his sister calling him.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
He said she had one of the new, better chairs.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
She said, "Oh I love it."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
She said, "But it's too high."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
(Laughter)

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
He came over and looked at it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And he showed her the lever.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Well, that's typical

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of a lot of us working in chairs.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And why should you

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
get a 20-page manual

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
about how to run a chair?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
(Laughter)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Anyway, I felt that it was important

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that you didn't have to make an adjustment

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
in order to get this kind of action.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The other thing I felt was that armrests

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
had never really been properly approached

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
from the standpoint of how much

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
of an aid they could be

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to your work life.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But I felt it was too much to ask

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
to have to adjust each individual armrest

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in order to get it where you wanted.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So I spent a long time.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I said I worked eight or nine years on it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And each of these things went along

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
sort of in parallel

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
but incrementally were a problem of their own.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I worked a long time on figuring out

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
how to move the arms over a much greater arc --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that is up and down --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and make them a lot easier,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
so that you didn't have to use a button.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And so after many trials, many failures,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
we came up with a very simple arrangement

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
in which we could just move

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
one arm or the other.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And they go up easily.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And stop where you want.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You can put them down, essentially out of the way.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
No arms at all.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Or you can pull them up where you want them.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And this was another thing that I felt,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
while not nearly as romantic

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
as Cary Grant,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
nevertheless begins to

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
grab a little bit of aesthetic

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
operation, aesthetic performance

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
into a product.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The next area that was of interest to me

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
was the fact that reclining

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
was a very important factor.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And the more you can recline,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
in a way, the better it is.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The more the angle between here and here opens up --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
so we keep it at more or less the same level --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but you transfer weight

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
off your tailbones.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and feel their tailbone?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
(Laughter)

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You feel that bone under there?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
(Laughter)

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Just your own.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
(Laughter)

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
There's two of them, one on either side.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
All the weight of your upper torso --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
your arms, your head --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
goes right down through your back,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
your spine, into those bones when you sit.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And that's a lot of load.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Just relieving your arms with armrests

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
takes 20 percent of that load off.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So to unload

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that great weight --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
if that indeed exists --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
you can recline.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
When you recline you take away a lot of that load

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And breathability is good.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But to do that, if you have any

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
amount of recline,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
it gets to the point where you need a headrest

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
because nearly always,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
automatically hold your head

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
in a vertical position, see?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Well if you're reclined a great deal,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
you have to use muscle force

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to hold your head there.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So that's where a headrest comes in.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now headrest is a challenge

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
because you want it to adjust

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
enough so that it'll fit,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
you know, a tall guy and a short girl.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So here we are.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I've got five inches of adjustment here

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
in order to get the headrest in the right place.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But then I knew from experience

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and looking around in offices

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
where there were chairs with headrests

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
that nobody would ever bother

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to reach back and turn a knob

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and adjust the headrest to put it in position.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And you need it in a different position

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
when you're upright, then when you're reclined.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So if you watch this chair

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
as I recline, the headrest comes up

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to meet my neck.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Ideally you want to put the head support

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
in the cranial area, right there.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So that part of it took a long time

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
to work out.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the gel we put.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
We stole the idea from bicycle seats,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and put gel in the cushions

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and in the armrests

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to absorb point load --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You cant hit your elbow

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
on bottom.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I did want to demonstrate

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the fact that the chair can accommodate people.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
While you're sitting in it you can adjust it

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
down for the five-footer,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
or you can adjust it

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
for the six-foot-six guy --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
(Applause)
