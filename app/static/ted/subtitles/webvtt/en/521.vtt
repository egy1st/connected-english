WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about the election.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
voted for an African-American candidate for President.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He won 375 electoral votes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And he won about 70 million popular votes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
more than any other presidential candidate --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of any race, of any party -- in history.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Democrats really like seeing this transition here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
even states Obama lost, like out west,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
those states became more blue.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but with a couple of exceptions here and there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
One exception is in Massachusetts.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That was John Kerry's home state.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Obama didn't have much improvement.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you see real big differences in this part of the country right here,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
20 or 30 point swings

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in 2008.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He lost badly but every Democrat does.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He lost no worse than most people do.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is because we asked those people.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
exit polls in every state,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in 37 states, out of the 50,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They asked this question.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of the candidate a factor?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
moreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and people who voted for John McCain

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
as a result of that factor,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We're looking for this behavior among white voters

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or, really, non-black voters.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So you see big differences in different parts

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of the country on this question.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is because he was an African-American."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
If those people had voted for Obama,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
admitted, I suppose,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
manifestation of racially-based voting.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Here is the same data on a map.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You kind of see the relationship between

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the redder states of where more people responded and said,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This really seems to explain

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
why Barack Obama did worse

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in this one part of the country.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So we have to ask why.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Is racism predictable in some way?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Is there something driving this?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that we don't understand, and Kentucky?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Or are there more systematic factors at work?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
things like income, and religion, education.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Which of these seem to drive

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
this manifestation of racism

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And there are a couple of these that have

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
strong predictive relationships,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
one of which is education,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
per adult are in red,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is less educated. It's just a fact.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And you see the relationship there

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
with the racially-based voting patterns.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The other variable that's important is

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the type of neighborhood that you live in.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
States that are more rural --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
they exhibit a little bit of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and the type of neighbors that you have,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
which we'll talk about more in a moment.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is that they're both very rural,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they are educationally impoverished.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So yes, racism is predictable.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
These things, among maybe other variables,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but these things seem to predict it.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We're going to drill down a little bit more now,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
into something called the General Social Survey.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is conducted by the University of Chicago

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
every other year.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And they ask a series of really interesting questions.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
about racial attitudes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
One simple question they asked is,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In cites, about 80 percent of people

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
who are unlike you.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and split them between those who have black neighbors --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
or, really, some neighbor of another race --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and people who have only white neighbors.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And we see in some variables

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But you see Democrats versus Republican,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
not a big difference based on who your neighbors are.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And even some questions about race -- for example

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
affirmative action, which is kind of a political question,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a policy question about race, if you will --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
not much difference here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
feel no differently about it really.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
There is a big difference.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
People who don't have neighbors of a different race

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
are about twice as likely

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's about who you live with.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So if you want to address it,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
ideas for maybe how to do that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I'm a big fan of cities.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So we can think more about things like street grids.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And you interact a lot with your neighbors --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
people you like, people you might not know.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And as a result it's a very tolerant community,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
which is different, I think, than something like this,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
which is in Schaumburg, Illinois,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I think that actually this type of urban design,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
more conservative under Ronald Reagan.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But also here is another idea we have --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
is an intercollegiate exchange program

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where you have students going from New York abroad.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and might never interact in a positive affirmative way

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I think part of the education variable we talked about before

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
is the networking experience you get when you go to college

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But the point is, this is all good news,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
because when something is predictable,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
it is what I call designable.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If we understand the root causes of the behavior

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
we can start to design solutions to it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
