00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A year and a half ago,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
four of the five people who are full time members

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at Ushahidi,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which means "testimony" in Swahili,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
were TED Fellows.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And in that time we prototyped and built,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in about three days, a system that would allow

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
anybody with a mobile phone

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to send in information and reports on what was happening around them.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We took what we knew about Africa,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the default device,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the mobile phone, as our common denominator,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and went from there.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We got reports like this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and we put it on our map.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But then we decided we needed to do something more.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We needed to take what we had built

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And so there is a team of developers

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
from all over Africa, who are part of this team now --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There is even some from the U.S.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as well as the developing world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We are realizing that this is true.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And so we build for it in Africa first

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and then we move to the edges.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
small NGOs doing their own little projects.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Just this last month it was deployed by

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Al Jazeera in Gaza.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm here to talk about the next big thing,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because what we're finding out is that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we have this capacity to report

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
where it's so much easier to report now

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
than it is to consume it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
There is so much information; what do you do?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is the Twitter reports for over three days

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
just covering Mumbai.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
How do you decide what is important?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So what we find is that there is this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
great deal of wasted crisis information

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because there is just too much information for us to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
actually do anything with right now.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And what we're actually really concerned with

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is this first three hours.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What we are looking at is the first three hours.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
How do we deal with that information that is coming in?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You can't understand what is actually happening.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
On the ground and around the world

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
people are still curious,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So what we built of course, Ushahidi,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is crowdsourcing this information.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So you've got a lot of information. That's great.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But now what?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And we have a small team who is working on this.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We think that we can actually create

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
a crowdsourced filter.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Take the crowd and apply them to the information.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And by rating it and by rating

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the different people who submit information,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we can get refined results

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and weighted results.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So that we have a better understanding

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of the probability of something being true or not.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This is the kind of innovation that is,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
From young, smart developers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And it's a community around it that has decided to build this.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So, thank you very much.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Applause)
