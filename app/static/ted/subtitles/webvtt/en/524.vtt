WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to read a few strips.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
These are, most of these are

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
from a monthly page I do

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in and architecture and design magazine

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
called Metropolis.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the first story is called

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
"The Faulty Switch."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Another beautifully designed new building

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's fine during the day

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But at dusk

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
everything changes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The architect spent hundreds of hours

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
designing the burnished brass switchplates

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for his new office tower.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And then left it to a contractor

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to install these 79-cent switches behind them.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We know instinctively where to reach

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
when we enter a dark room.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But the sound we are greeted with,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
as the room is bathed in the simulated glow

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of late-afternoon light,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
recalls to mind

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a dirty men's room

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This sound colors our first impression of any room;

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it can't be helped.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But where does this sound,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
commonly described as a click, come from?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Is it simply the byproduct of a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
crude mechanical action?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Or is it an imitation

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of one half the set of sounds we make

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to express disappointment?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The often dental consonant

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of no Indo-European language.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Or is it the amplified sound

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of a synapse firing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in the brain of a cockroach?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In the 1950s they tried their best

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to muffle this sound

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with mercury switches

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and silent knob controls.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But today these improvements

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
seem somehow inauthentic.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The click is the modern

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
triumphal clarion

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
proceeding us through life,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
announcing our entry into every lightless room.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The sound made flicking a wall switch off

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is of a completely different nature.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It has a deep melancholy ring.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Children don't like it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Adults find it comforting.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But wouldn't it be an easy matter

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to wire a wall switch

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Or the distant peel of thunder?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Thomas Edison went through

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
thousands of unlikely substances

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
before he came upon the right one

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
for the filament of his electric light bulb.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Why have we settled so quickly

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for the sound of its switch?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's the end of that.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The next story is called

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
"In Praise of the Taxpayer."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
have survived yet another commercial building boom,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is cause for celebration.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
These one or two story structures,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
designed to yield only enough income

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to cover the taxes on the land

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
on which they stand,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
were not meant to be permanent buildings.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Yet for one reason or another

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
they have confounded the efforts of developers

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
to be combined into lots

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
suitable for high-rise construction.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Although they make no claim to architectural beauty,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
they are, in their perfect temporariness,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
a delightful alternative

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to the large-scale structures

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that might someday take their place.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The most perfect examples

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
occupy corner lots.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They offer a pleasant respite

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
from the high-density development around them.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
A break of light and air,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
an architectural biding of time.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So buried in signage

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
are these structures,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that it often takes a moment

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
to distinguish the modern

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
specially constructed taxpayer

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
from its neighbor:

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the small commercial building

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
from an earlier century,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
whose upper floors have been sealed,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and whose groundfloor space

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
now functions as a taxpayer.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The few surfaces not covered by signs

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
are often clad in a distinctive, dark

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
green-gray, striated aluminum siding.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Take-out sandwich shops,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
film processing drop-offs,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
peep-shows and necktie stores.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now these provisional structures have,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in some cases,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
remained standing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
for the better part of a human lifetime.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The temporary building

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is a triumph of modern industrial organization,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
a healthy sublimation

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
of the urge to build,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and proof that not every

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
architectural idea

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
need be set in stone.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That's the end.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Laughter)

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
For the ancient Egyptians

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the lap was a platform

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
upon which to place

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the earthly possessions of the dead --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
30 cubits from foot to knee.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It was not until the 14th century

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that an Italian painter

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
recognized the lap

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
as a Grecian temple,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
upholstered in flesh and cloth.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Over the next 200 years

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we see the infant Christ

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
go from a sitting to a standing position

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
on the Virgin's lap,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and then back again.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Every child recapitulates this ascension,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
straddling one or both legs,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
sitting sideways,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
or leaning against the body.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is but a brief moment in history.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You were late for school again this morning.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The ventriloquist must first make us believe

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that a small boy is sitting on his lap.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The illusion of speech follows incidentally.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
As adults we admire the lap

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
from a nostalgic distance.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We have fading memories

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
of that provisional temple,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
erected each time an adult sat down.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It is children and teenage girls

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
who are most keenly aware

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
of its architectural beauty.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They understand the structural integrity

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of a deep avuncular lap,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
as compared to the shaky arrangement

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
of a neurotic niece in high heels.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The relationship between the lap and its owner

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is direct and intimate.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I envision a 36-story,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
450-unit residential high-rise --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
a reason to consider the mental health

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of any architect before granting

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
an important commission.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The bathrooms and kitchens will,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of course, have no windows.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The lap of luxury

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
is an architectural construct of childhood,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
which we seek, in vain,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
as adults, to employ.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
That's the end.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Laughter)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
A nondescript warehouse,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
visible for a moment

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
serves as the temporary resting place

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for the Haverpiece collection

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
of European dried fruit.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The profound convolutions

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
on the surface of a dried cherry.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Do you remember wandering as a child

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
through those dark wooden

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
storefront galleries?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Where everything was displayed

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Pears dried in the form

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of genital organs.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Apricot halves

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
like the ears of cherubim.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
In 1962 the unsold stock

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
a wealthy prune juice bottler,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and consolidated to form the core collection.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
As an art form it lies somewhere between

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
still-life painting and plumbing.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Upon his death in 1967,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
a quarter of the items were sold off for compote

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to a high-class hotel restaurant.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
(Laughter)

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Unsuspecting guests were served

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
stewed turn-of-the-century

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Turkish figs for breakfast.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Laughter)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The rest of the collection remains here,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
stored in plain brown paper bags

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
until funds can be raised
