00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first half of the 20th century

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
was an absolute disaster in human affairs,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a cataclysm.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We had the First World War,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the Great Depression,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the Second World War

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the rise of the communist nations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And each one of these forces

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
split the world, tore the world apart,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
divided the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they threw up walls --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
political walls, trade walls,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
transportation walls,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
communication walls, iron curtains --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which divided peoples and nations.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It was only in the second half of the 20th century

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that we slowly began to pull ourselves

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
out of this abyss.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Trade walls began to come tumbling down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here are some data on tariffs:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We globalized the world. And what does that mean?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It means that we extended cooperation

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
across national boundaries;

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we made the world more cooperative.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Transportation walls came tumbling down.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it can be manned with a smaller crew;

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and unloaded faster than ever before.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
have come tumbling down.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And of course the iron curtains,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
political walls have come tumbling down.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Trade has increased.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Here is just a little bit of data.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In 1990, exports from China to the United States:

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
15 billion dollars.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And perhaps most remarkably,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
at the beginning of the 21st century,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
really for the first time in modern history,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
growth extended to almost all parts of the world.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So China, I've already mentioned,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
growth -- ten percent a year.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Year after year after year,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
absolutely incredible.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Never before in human history

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have so many people been raised out of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
such great poverty as happened in China.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
over the last three decades.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
India, starting a little bit later,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Incomes at that time

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
less than $1,000 per year.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And over the next 18 years

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
have almost tripled.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
has been the area of the world

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
most resistant to growth.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And we can see the tragedy of Africa

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the first few bars here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Growth was negative.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
People were actually getting poorer than their parents,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But at the end of the 20th century,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the beginning of the 21st century,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we saw growth in Africa.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because I believe that the best is yet to come.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now why.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
On the cutting edge today

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it's new ideas which are driving growth.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And by that I mean it's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
products for which the research and development costs

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
More than ever before it is these types of ideas

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
which are driving growth on the cutting edge.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now ideas have this amazing property.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
He said, "He who receives an idea from me

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
As he who lights his candle at mine

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
receives light without darkening me."

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Or to put it slightly differently:

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
one apple feeds one man,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but an idea can feed the world.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is practically the model of TED.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is going to drive growth even more than ever before.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This provides a reason why

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
trade and globalization

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
are even more important, more powerful than ever before,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and are going to increase growth more than ever before.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And to explain why this is so, I have a question.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Suppose that there are two diseases:

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
one of them is rare, the other one is common,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but if they are not treated they are equally severe.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
If you had to choose, which would you rather have:

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the common disease or the rare disease?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
than there are to treat rare diseases.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The reason for this is incentives.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It costs about the same to produce a new drug

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
whether that drug treats 1,000 people,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
100,000 people, or a million people.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So the incentives are much larger

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to produce drugs which treat more people.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
To put this differently: larger markets save lives.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
In this case misery truly does love company.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Now think about the following:

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
As other countries become richer

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the demand for these pharmaceuticals

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is going to increase tremendously.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which benefits everyone in the world.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Larger markets increase the incentive

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to produce all kinds of ideas,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
whether it's a new design.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
For the Hollywood people in the audience,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
this even explains why action movies

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
have larger budgets than comedies:

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
it's because action movies translate easier

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
into other languages and other cultures,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
so the market for those movies is larger.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
People are willing to invest more,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and the budgets are larger.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to produce new ideas,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
how do we maximize that incentive?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The way I like to put this is:

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
so one idea can serve one world, one market.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
One idea, one world, one market.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Well how else can we create new ideas?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
That's one reason.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Globalize trade.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
How else can we create new ideas?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Well, more idea creators.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
of the world's population are scientists and engineers.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Laughter)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The United States has been an idea leader.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
A large fraction of those people are in the United States.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And for that I am very grateful.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
That is a good thing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because for too long the United States,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and a handful of other developed countries,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
have shouldered the entire burden

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
of research and development.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But consider the following:

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
contributing to ideas which benefit everyone,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
which are shared by everyone.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
How many Ramanujans are there in India today

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
when they could be feeding the world?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Now we're not there yet.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But it is going to happen in this century.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
The real tragedy of the last century is this:

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
if you think about the world's population

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
then the great tragedy has been

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that billions of our processors have been off line.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But in this century China is coming on line.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
India is coming on line.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Africa is coming on line.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Here is just some data. This is China.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
1996: less than one million

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
new university students in China per year;

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
2006: over five million.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Now think what this means.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
That is something that we should embrace --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We need a greater demand for ideas --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
those larger markets I was talking about earlier --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and a greater supply of ideas for the world.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Globalization is increasing the demand

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
In fact if you look at world history

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
you can see some reasons for optimism.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
From about the beginnings of humanity

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but less in a century

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
than you expect to see in a year today.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
1900s: maybe one percent.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Even at that rate,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
by 2100 average GDP per capita

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in the world will be $200,000.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
That's not that far.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We won't make it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But some of our grandchildren probably will.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I should say,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I think this is a rather modest prediction.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Laughter)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Alright what about problems?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
What about a great depression?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Here is GDP per capita

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
from 1900 to 1929.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
trying to forecast future growth for the United States,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
not knowing that we were about to enter

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
What would you have predicted, not knowing this?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
If you had based your prediction, your forecast

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
on 1900 to 1929

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
you'd have predicted something like this.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
If you'd been a little more optimistic --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So what actually happened?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We went off a cliff but we recovered.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
In fact in the second half of the 20th century

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
based upon the first half of the 20th century.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So growth can wash away

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
even what appears to be a great depression.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Alright. What else?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So people were asking a question. They were saying,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
"Is China drinking our milkshake?"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Laughter)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And there is some truth to this,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But I think I don't have to tell this audience

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Moreover, as everyone knows,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And higher oil prices mean

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
a greater incentive to invest in energy R&amp;D.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
You can see this in the data.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The world is much better equipped

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
to overcome an increase in the price of oil

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
today, than ever in the past,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
because of what I'm talking about.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
One idea, one world, one market.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So I'm optimistic

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
so long as we hew to these two ideas:

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to keep globalizing world markets,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and keep investing in education.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now the United States has a particularly important role

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
to play in this:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to keep our education system globalized,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
because our education system

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is the candle

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that other students come to light their own candles.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now remember here what Jefferson said.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Jefferson said, "When they come

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and light their candles at ours,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
they gain light, and we are not darkened."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Because the truth is,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
when they light their candles at ours,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
there is twice as much light available for everyone.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So my view is: Be optimistic.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Thank you.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
(Applause)
