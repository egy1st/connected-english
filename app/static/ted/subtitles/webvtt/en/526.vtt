00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
reminds me of an aphorism, of a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
comment of Woody Allen

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And it's this machine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
things today that we couldn't do yesterday.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And of course it's born stupid.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The last time you were in the presence of a baby --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Isn't she fabulous?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But nonetheless when she popped out

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in its development for several months before

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on the basis of her experiences in the womb --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
nonetheless she had very limited abilities,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as does every infant

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In fact there is little evidence that there is any

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
cognitive ability in a very young infant.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Infants don't respond to much.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
control their movements.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It would be several months before this infant

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
could do something as simple as reach out and grasp

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
under voluntary control an object and retrieve it,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
usually to the mouth.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And it will be some months beforeward,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we see a long steady progression

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
of the evolution from the first wiggles,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
standing, walking,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
before we get to that magical point

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in which we can motate in the world.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And yet, when we look forward in the brain

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we see really remarkable advance.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
By this age the brain can actually store.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It has stored, recorded,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
can fastly retrieve

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the meanings of thousands,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
tens of thousands of objects,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
actions, and their relationships in the world.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
potentially millions of ways.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This brain is very much a thinking machine.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And by this age there is absolutely no question

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that this brain, it has a person on board.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
in its capacity to control movement.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now movement has advanced to the point

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
where it can actually control movement simultaneously,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in a complex sequence, in complex ways

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as would be required for example

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for playing a complicated game,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
like soccer.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You could go out into the community in Monterey,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
(Laughter)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That's all another way of saying

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that our individual skills and abilities

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
are very much shaped by our environments.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That environment extends into our contemporary culture,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the thing our brain is challenged with.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that are specific to our own individual histories.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And in fact they result in a wonderful

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
differentiation in humankind,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in the way that, in fact, no two of us

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
are quite alike.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that all derive out of the plasticity,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In an adult brain of course we've built up

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that we can perform more or less automatically from memory,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Now we study this,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
by engaging the brains

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
of animals like rats, or monkeys,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
or of this particularly curious creature --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And we try to track the changes that occur

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
as the new skill or ability is acquired.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In fact we do this in individuals

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of any age, in these different species --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that is to say from infancies,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
infancy up to adulthood and old age.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So we might engage a rat, for example,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to acquire a new skill or ability

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that might involve the rat using its paw

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to master particular manual grasp behaviors

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
just like we might examine a child

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and their ability to acquire the sub-skills,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
or the general overall skill of accomplishing something

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
like mastering the ability to read.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Or you might look in an older individual

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
who has mastered a complex set of abilities

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that might relate to reading musical notation

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
or performing the mechanical acts of performance

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that apply to musical performance.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
From these studies we defined two great epochs

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of the plastic history of the brain.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in its initial form its basic processing machinery.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
This is actually a period of dramatic change

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
All it takes for example in the sound domain,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is exposure to sound.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the brain actually is at the mercy

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of the sound environment in which it is reared.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So for example I can rear an animal

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
a repertoire of sound that I make up,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that I make, just by exposure, artificially important

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to the animal and its young brain.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
its initial processing of that sound

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to represent it in an organized and orderly way.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
like the sounds that simulate

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the sounds of a native language of a child.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I can raise an animal under conditions

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that would be equivalent to raising a baby

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
under a moderately loud ceiling fan,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in the presence of continuous noise.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And I frustrate its ability

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Such things in the early history of babies

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
occur in real babies.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And they account for, for example

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in every normally developing baby.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And so they also account for

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
development of defective processing

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in a substantial population of children

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
who are more limited, as a consequence,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in their language abilities at an older age.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Now in this early period of plasticity

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
so that it can act differentially,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
so that it can act selectively,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
so that the creature that wears it, that carries it,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
can begin to operate on it in a selective way.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the brain is actually refining its machinery

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And in this epoch,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
which extends from late in the first year of life to death;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
it's actually doing this under behavioral control.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And that's another way of saying

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the brain has strategies that define

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the significance of the input to the brain.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And it's focusing on skill after skill,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
or ability after ability,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
under specific attentional control.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
This is actually very powerful.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is powerfully expressed.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It is the basis of our real differentiation,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
one individual from another.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You can look down in the brain of an animal

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that's engaged in a specific skill,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So here is a very simple experiment.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It was actually conducted about five years ago

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in Marseilles.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
in a task that involves it manipulating a tool

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that's equivalent in its difficulty

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The monkey actually mastered the task

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in about 700 practice tries.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Those tries were elaborate.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And 700 or so tries later

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
At this point the task is being performed

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
in a beautifully stereotyped way:

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
We can look down in the brain of the monkey.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And we see that it's distorted.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in many such behaviors across time.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And here we see the distortion

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
location by location,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We see here a reconstruction of how

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
the hand is represented in the brain.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
If we look at the selectivity of responses

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in the cortex of the monkey,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
which represents input from the skin

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
of the fingertips that are engaged.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in this most organized of cortical areas

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
of the surface of the skin of the body.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Monkey has like you have.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you --

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
part of acquiring the skill or ability.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
in the monkey learning this task.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to the skill or ability.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So for example we can look to the cortical area

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and the sequences of movements

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that are required in the behavior, and so forth.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when you learn a simple skill like this.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And that represents in your brain, really massive change.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It represents the change in a reliable way

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of the responses of tens of millions,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It represents changes

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
of hundreds of millions, possibly billions

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
of synaptic connections in your brain.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
This is constructed by physical change.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Or acquiring their native language abilities.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The changes are massive.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
What it's all about is the selective representations

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of things that are important to the brain.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Because in most of the life of the brain

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
this is under control of behavioral context.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's what you pay attention to.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's what's rewarding to you.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
It's what the brain regards, itself,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
as positive and important to you.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It's all about cortical processing

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and forebrain specialization.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And that underlies your specialization.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
That is why you, in your many skills and abilities,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
are a unique specialist:

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
a specialist that's vastly different

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in your physical brain in detail

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
than the brain of an individual 100 years ago;

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
enormously different in the details

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
is that information is always related

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to other inputs or information that is occurring

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
in immediate time, in context.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that are correlated in little moments of time

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
The brain is recording all information

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and driving all change

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
in temporal context.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that's occurred in your brain is you.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Billions of events have occurred in your history

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that are related in time to yourself

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as the receiver,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
yourself as the mover.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
from the surface of your body

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that are always associated with you as the receiver,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and that result in

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the embodiment of you.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You are constructed, your self is constructed

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
from these billions of events.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And it's created in the brain via physical change.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
This is a marvelously constructed thing

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that results in individual form

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
because each one of us has vastly different histories,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and vastly different experiences,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
of personhood.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Now we've used this research

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to try to understand not just how a normal person develops,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and elaborates their skills and abilities,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but also try to understand

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the origins of impairment,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and the origins of differences or variations

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I'm going to talk about using these strategies

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to actually design brain plasticity-based

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
that increases the competence of the child

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
as a language receiver and user

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and, thereafter, as a reader.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
actually using this brain science,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And then, by using it in a targeted approach

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
we're going to try to differentiate

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the machinery to recover function in old age.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So the first example I'm going to talk about

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
relates to children with learning impairments.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We now have a large body of literature

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that demonstrates that the fundamental

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
problem that occurs in the majority of children

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that have early language impairments,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and that are going to struggle to learn to read,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
is that their language processor

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is created in a defective form.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And the reason that it rises in a defective form

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
is because early in the baby's brain's life

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the machine process is noisy.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's that simple.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
There are numerous inherited faults

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that could make the machine process noisier.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
on the basis of information provided

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in the world from the ears.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
was born with what we called mental retardation.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
That's disappeared. That no longer applies.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
That inherited weakness, that inherited condition

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
has evaporated.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
about 35 years ago,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
that if you simply fix the problem early enough,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
when the brain is still in this initial plastic period

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
so it can set up this machinery adequately,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in this initial set up time in the critical period,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
none of that happens.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You're basically opening up

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
which have had them reliably full.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It's degraded.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
The child's native language is such a case is not English.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It's not Japanese.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It's crap.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And the brain specializes for it.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
It creates a representation of language crap.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And then the child is stuck with it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
It can also happen in the brain.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And the native language for a child with such a brain

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is degraded.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's not English. It's noisy English.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
not normal -- a different strategy,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
They are about an order of magnitude longer,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
about 11 times longer in duration on average,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
than in a normal child.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Space constants are about three times greater.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
in this domain.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
they are receiving it and representing it,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and in information it's representing crap.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And they are going to have poor reading skills.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
into this orthographic or visual

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
representational form.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
that translation makes no sense.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Then these children increasingly

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
in evaluation after evaluation,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
in their operations in language, and their operations in reading --

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
we document that abnormal neurology.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
the processing capacity of the machinery

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
by changing it.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So here we're looking at the normal distribution.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
This is from about 3,000 children.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
are moving into the middle or the right.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
This is like an IQ test for language.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and narrow the distribution.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
This is a substantially large impact.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
We have the potential to move most of those children

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to the middle or to the right side.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
In addition to accurate language training

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
it also fixes memory and cognition

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
speech fluency and speech production.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
that is to say reading.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And to a large extent it fixes the brain.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
You can look down in the brain of a child

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And children operating in various language behaviors,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
or in various reading behaviors,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
you see for the most extent,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
for most children, their neuronal responses,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
complexly abnormal before you start,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
are normalized by the training.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Now you can also take the same approach

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
to address problems in aging.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
from competent machinery, it's going south.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Noise is increasing in the brain.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and witness a change in the time constants and space constants

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
it's going back into chaos in the end.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
This results in declines in memory

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
this is a small population of such individuals --

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
train equally intensively for about 30 hours.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
of their ability to remember things after a delay,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
of their ability to control their attention,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
The overall neuropsychological index

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
of these trained individuals in this population

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
is about two standard deviations.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
the average person has moved to the middle

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
or the right side of the distribution.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
It means that most people who are at risk for senility,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
more or less immediately,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
are now in a protected position.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
My issues are to try to get to rescuing

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
older citizens more completely and in larger numbers,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and the same for kids.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I'm specifically interested in things like autism,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Your issues as it relates to this science,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And of course, a well-ordered life

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
But also in your future is brain aerobics.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
not too far in the future,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
just like physical exercise

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
literature and the science that is important to you

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Now that you know, now that science is telling us

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
that you are in charge,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
that it's under your control,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
that your happiness, your well-being,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
your abilities, your capacities,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
are capable of continuous modification,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
continuous improvement,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
and you're the responsible agent and party.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
It will be a long time before they really understand it.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
(Laughter)

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Now that's another issue and not my fault.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Okay. Thank you.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
(Applause)
