WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I thought to myself that well, it's TED.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to justify my participation in something like that?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
might help things a bit.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and just talk the way I really talk

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because I am from Queens, New York.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I suppose it's fair to say

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But then what?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And well, they're very excited.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What I should tell you --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Laughter)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Oh, wonderful.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Good evening everybody.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Thank you so very much for having me here today.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh my! There's so many of you.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Hi sweetheart. Okay.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Laughter)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She's a very nice, young black girl.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Well you know, she calls herself black --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But anyway.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
She has me here because she puts me in her show,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what she calls her one-woman show.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And you know what that means, of course.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But I don't mind.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Really, it's amazing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but the celebrities.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
There are so many celebrities running around here.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Isn't that adorable?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You know, she's only half Jewish.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Did you know that about her?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yeah, she's lovely.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you're all so young.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You know, your parents must be very proud.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I noticed it's very multicultural.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It's like a rainbow.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
What are you allowed to say or not say?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But anyway, you know,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I just think that to be here with all of you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
accomplished young people --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You know, it's heartening to me.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
absolutely horrifying.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's true. It's true.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You know, between the environmental degradation

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Anyway.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
(Laughter)

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to get us out of this mess.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Thank you for all that you do.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, happy continued success.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Congratulations. Mazel tov.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
(Applause)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Hi. Hi.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Thank you everybody.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
My name is Noraida. And I'm just --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that you're doing and everything like that.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I am Dominican-American.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And I think he's Mexican, so that's --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
(Laughter)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I just -- I'm sorry.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
as you can imagine.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that this even exists.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I like that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which is like a leadership thing,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And the organization is called DA BOMB,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
but with the war on terror and everything,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So, basically like DA BOMB --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and who also happen to be mothers like me.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Right now it's very exciting actually for me

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that's my new title.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
like something like this is so vital

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, I think all people, we need that,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
making the talks available online.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
That's very good. I love that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Applause)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, that was Noraida,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
friends, neighbors, family members.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I come from a multicultural family.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
In fact, the older lady you just met:

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It's a long story, believe me.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But on top of my family background,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
where I encountered a plethora of new characters,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
you know, she was kind of typically French.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But [German].

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Yes, I took German for three years, [German],

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
even in the UN school.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Although, you know, it was wonderful.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Never. He always, always treated each of us,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you know, equally unbearably during the class.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
classmates from everywhere,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And they've inspired many characters as well.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
For example, a friend of mine.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But, you know, I am originally from India,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and I wanted to start by telling you

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to come here to TED in California,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
trying to make me feel comfortable

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So, you can just imagine -- right.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Applause)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I'm trying to behave myself,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
it's my first time here.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Uh, well, thank you.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Good evening.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
My name is Pauline Ning,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and first I want to tell you that I'm --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
much less like this

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
because I did not like to give speeches

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I try anyway.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But my background --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I want to tell you story only briefly.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and they would always answer me back in English.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But when they got older,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But that's where we had some problems.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But I think he will change his mind soon.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But first, she said she's not interested.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
She only wants to spend time with her friends.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And then at college, it's like she never came home.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
because I don't like them."

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I am lesbian."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Laughter) --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Laughter)

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
but from my son, not my daughter.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Laughter)

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But at first I did not know what to do.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So, even though sometimes it's still hard,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I will share with you that it helps me to realize

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
because of ideas like this,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and people like you, with an open mind.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
in the ways maybe even you don't realize.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So, for my daughter's sake,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Thank you. Xie xie.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
to be last today.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I am originally from Jordan.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It is not Harvard.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
But I am very proud of my students.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I do like to make the point that we in global society,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
So, back in the ancient times.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:45.000
[Arabic]

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And this roughly translates:

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
"Please, let me hold your hand.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I want to hold your hand.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I want to hold your hand.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
listening to the Beatles.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Okay? Great.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
(Applause)

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Thank you for having me.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
(Applause)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Thank you very, very much. I love you.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
(Applause)

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Well, you have to let me say this.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I just -- thank you.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And I know I've performed for some of your companies

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
or some of you have seen me elsewhere,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
(Applause)
