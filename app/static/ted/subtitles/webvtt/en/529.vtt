WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the first question is, why do we need to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
even worry about a pandemic threat?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is it that we're concerned about?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're concerned in the national security community,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and of course in the biology community and the public health community.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
While globalization has increased travel,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
all the time, all over the world.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Katrina showed us

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we cannot completely depend on government

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
some of you call it bird flu --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but we didn't know about it until 1997.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
have had this virus emerge,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in either birds, or people or both.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In the bird outbreaks we now can see

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
except the Americas.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In domestic birds, especially chickens,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it's 100 percent lethal.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in circulation in the world

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in any recent centuries.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with the result that there's cover-up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's also carried on migration patterns

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of wild migratory aquatic birds.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There has been this centralized event

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Two years ago the migrating birds

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
had a multiple event

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where thousands died because of a mutation occurring

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in the virus,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
which made the species range broaden dramatically.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so far, fortunately, small events,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to form two distinct families, if you will,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of the H5N1 viral tree

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
with branches in them,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and with different attributes that are worrying.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at no time in history have we succeeded in making

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for more than 260 million people.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
if we have a real outbreak.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So one thought is:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
after 9/11, when the airports closed,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
our flu season was delayed by two weeks.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
let's shut down the airports.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
However, huge supercomputer analyses,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
done of the likely effectiveness of this,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
show that it won't buy us much time at all.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
For example, all masks are made in China.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
How do you get them mobilized around the world

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if you've shut all the airports down?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of the infected animals.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and now also domestic pet dogs.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It mimics what we now understand

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the last great pandemic,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We had evolution over time,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
55 percent of people who have become infected

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we don't have a huge number of people

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
who got infected and never developed disease.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In experimental feeding in monkeys

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you can see that it actually downregulates

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
a specific immune system modulator.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The result is that what kills you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The result: most of the deaths

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
have been in people under 30 years of age,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
robustly healthy young adults.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We have seen human-to-human transmission

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in at least three clusters --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
fortunately involving very intimate contact,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Alright, so I've got you nervous.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And we have spent a lot of money.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Most of the spending in the Bush administration

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
has actually been more related to the anthrax results

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and bio-terrorism threat.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to look at infectious diseases.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
End result: only 15 states

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
have been certified to be able to do mass distribution

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Half the states would run out of hospital beds

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in the first week, maybe two weeks.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So what have people been doing with this money?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Exercises, drills, all over the world.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Let's everybody run around and play your role.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Nobody knows the chain of command.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the Principle Federal Officer,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
who happens to be with TSA.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The government says

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the federal responsibility will basically be

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and then to mitigate the impact

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
primarily on our economy.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The rest is up to your local community.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Everything is about your town, where you live.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Well how good a city council you have,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Most local facilities would all be competing

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
to try and get their hands on their piece

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of available vaccines, and any other treatments,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And you'll have massive competition.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
made by Sanofi-Aventis.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The vaccine will probably be useless.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So here's where the decisions come in.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You're the mayor of your local town.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
in order to minimize the spread

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
between households by household cats, dogs and so on.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to take care of patients?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
What about quarantine?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We have no uniform policies

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
regarding quarantine across the United States.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And some states have differential policies, county by county.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
if their kids aren't in school.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
pretend a pandemic was underway.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
What they found was, the core functions --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you know you still sort of had banks,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Nobody was processing the credit cards.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Your insurance payments didn't go through.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And that's just office workers, bankers.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But actually in scientific community there is great debate

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
about what percentage of flu transmission between people

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is from sneezing and coughing

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and what percentage is on your hands.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because we don't make them in America anymore,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they're all made in China --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that most of transmission was because

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
people were removing their masks improperly.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It wasn't flying microbes.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We don't actually have a standard

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for what should be the protective gear for the first responders,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the people who will actually be there on the front lines.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
There is some indication

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
A public health survey analyzed the effect

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
actually shows it counteractive

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to public health measures, making matters worse.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And here is the other interesting thing:

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is metabolized appropriately

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to be an active compound in the human being.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The rest turns into a stable compound,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
which survives filtration into the water systems,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and providing them a chance

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to breed resistant strains.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So I personally think that our life expectancy

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
for Tamiflu as an effective drug

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is very limited -- very limited indeed.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Nevertheless most of the governments

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
have based their whole flu policies

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Russia has actually stockpiled enough

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
for 95 percent of all Russians.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then you're on your own because

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Some of the poorer countries

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
they're already expired. They are already out of date.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
What do we know from 1918,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
the last great pandemic?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
all over America.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Every city, county, state did their own thing.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And the rules

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the belief systems were wildly disparate.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In some cases all schools, all churches,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
all public venues were closed.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
in the absence of commercial air travel.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But by the time the second wave hit

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
it took such a toll among the healthcare workers

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Overall we lost 700,000 people.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and we don't actually know why.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
robustly healthy young adults.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It was likened to the plague.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We don't actually know how many people died.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
This was based on European and North American data.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
shows that if you look at the databases that were kept

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
by the Brits in India,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
the death toll was far higher.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And that a more likely toll

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
before we had commercial air travel.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So are we ready?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
As a nation, no we're not.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And I think even those in the leadership

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
would say that is the case,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that we still have a long ways to go.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
for yourself, your family, or your employees --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
unless you've really done your homework.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
How many masks do you need?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The Institute of Medicine study felt that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
you could not recycle masks.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
for every single person in your family?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We don't know -- again with Tamiflu,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the number one side effect of Tamiflu is

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
flu-like symptoms.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So then how can you tell

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
who in your family has the flu

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
if everybody is taking Tamiflu?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
If you expand that out to think of a whole community,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
or all your employees in your company,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
you begin to realize how limited

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the Tamiflu option might be.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Everybody has come up to me and said,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But really? Do you really have a place

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Do you want to view the pandemic threat

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the way back in the 1950s

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
people viewed the civil defense issue,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I don't think that's rational.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I think it's about having to be prepared

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
as communities, not as individuals --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
being prepared as nation,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
being prepared as state, being prepared as town.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And right now most of the preparedness

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
is deeply flawed.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And I hope I've convinced you of that,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
which means that the real job is go out and

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
say to your local leaders,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and your national leaders,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
"Why haven't you solved these problems?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Why are you still thinking that

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But I guess the other thing to add is,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
if you do have employees, and you do have a company,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I think you have certain responsibilities

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and you are trying to plan.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
At a minimum the British banking plan showed that

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
telecommuting can be helpful.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It probably does reduce exposure

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
or touching common objects

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and sharing things via their hands.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
But can you sustain your company that way?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Otherwise you're in trouble.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Happy to take your questions.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
(Applause)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But I would say that honestly we don't know.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Clearly the bottom line is

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the virus eventually attenuates,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and finds other hosts.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But we don't really know how and why that happens.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It's a very complicated ecology.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You know way more than any of us.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
LG: The moment that you see any evidence

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of serious human-to-human to transmission.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Not just intimately between family members

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
who took care of an ailing sister or brother,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
but a community infected --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
spread within a school,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Then I think that there is universal agreement

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
now, at WHO all the way down:

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Send out the alert.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Can you talk about that?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and other common statins for cholesterol control

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
may decrease your vulnerability

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
to influenza.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But we do not completely understand why.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The mechanism isn't clear.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And I don't know that there is any way

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
responsibly for someone to start

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
medicating their children

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in your children, doing such a thing.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
before the symptoms are full-blown?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
LG: Right. So I have for a long time said

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And our Centers for Disease Control

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
has labeled a test they developed

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
a rapid diagnostic.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in highly skilled hands.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I'm thinking dipstick.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It tells you if you have H5N1.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
In terms of where we are in science

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
with DNA identification capacities and so on,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
it's not that far off.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
they theorized that there was some attenuation

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
of the virus when it made the leap into humans.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Is that likely, do you think, here?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I mean 100 percent death rate

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
is pretty severe.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
what the lethality was

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
of the 1918 strain to wild birds

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
before it jumped from birds to humans.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
It's curious that there is no evidence

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
of mass die-offs of chickens

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
or household birds across America

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
before the human pandemic happened.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
That may be because those events

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
were occurring on the other side of the world

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
where nobody was paying attention.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But the virus clearly

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
went through one round around the world

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
in a mild enough form

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
that the British army in World War I

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
actually certified that it was not a threat

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and would not affect the outcome of the war.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And after circulating around the world

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
What percentage of infected people were killed by it?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Again we don't really know for sure.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
you had a weakened immune system,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
you lived in poverty in India or Africa,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
your likelihood of dying was far greater.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
But we don't really know.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and that a pneumonia vaccine

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
on the grounds that

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And that most people who die of regular flu --

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
which in regular flu years

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
is about 360,000 people worldwide,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
most of them senior citizens --

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And along comes pneumococcus

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
or another bacteria, streptococcus

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
similarly bacterial infection

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
has not been an issue at all.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
that is the key to why people die of this virus.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And I would just add

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
we saw the same thing with SARS.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So what's going on here is your body says,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
"I don't know what the heck this is.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
because those antibodies aren't here.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
because those T-cells don't recognize it either.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
stimulate the total cytokine cascade.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
(Applause)
