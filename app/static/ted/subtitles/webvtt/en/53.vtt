00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.406
If you're here today --

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.364
and I'm very happy that you are --

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:06.741
you've all heard about
how sustainable development

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.727
will save us from ourselves.

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:12.250
However, when we're not at TED,
we are often told

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:16.183
that a real sustainability policy agenda
is just not feasible,

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:18.976
especially in large urban areas
like New York City.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.665
And that's because most people
with decision-making powers,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.919
in both the public and the private sector,

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:27.229
really don't feel
as though they're in danger.

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:31.671
The reason why I'm here today,
in part, is because of a dog --

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.973
an abandoned puppy I found
back in the rain, back in 1998.

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.976
She turned out to be
a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.

00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:42.406
When she came into my life, we were
fighting against a huge waste facility

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.892
planned for the East River waterfront

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:47.426
despite the fact that
our small part of New York City

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.808
already handled more than 40 percent
of the entire city's commercial waste:

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:56.976
a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,
a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.335
the world's largest
food-distribution center,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.541
as well as other industries that bring
more than 60,000 diesel truck trips

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:04.721
to the area each week.

00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:09.086
The area also has one of the lowest ratios
of parks to people in the city.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.403
So when I was contacted
by the Parks Department

00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:15.585
about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative
to help develop waterfront projects,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.523
I thought they were really
well-meaning, but a bit naive.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:22.214
I'd lived in this area all my life,
and you could not get to the river,

00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:25.531
because of all the lovely facilities
that I mentioned earlier.

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:27.815
Then, while jogging
with my dog one morning,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.950
she pulled me into what I thought
was just another illegal dump.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:35.383
There were weeds and piles of garbage
and other stuff that I won't mention here,

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:36.621
but she kept dragging me,

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:39.517
and lo and behold, at the end
of that lot was the river.

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.642
I knew that this forgotten
little street-end,

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.670
abandoned like the dog that brought
me there, was worth saving.

00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:47.290
And I knew it would grow
to become the proud beginnings

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:50.298
of the community-led revitalization
of the new South Bronx.

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:54.301
And just like my new dog, it was an idea
that got bigger than I'd imagined.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:56.460
We garnered much support along the way,

00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:59.644
and the Hunts Point Riverside Park
became the first waterfront park

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:02.067
that the South Bronx had had
in more than 60 years.

00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.457
We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant
more than 300 times,

00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:07.721
into a $3 million park.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:12.673
And in the fall, I'm going to exchange
marriage vows with my beloved.

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:13.697
(Audience whistles)

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.989
Thank you very much.

00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:19.555
(Applause)

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.976
That's him pressing my buttons
back there, which he does all the time.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.464
(Laughter)

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:28.805
(Applause)

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.607
But those of us living
in environmental justice communities

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:33.186
are the canary in the coal mine.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.621
We feel the problems right now,
and have for some time.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.976
Environmental justice, for those of you
who may not be familiar with the term,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
goes something like this:

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.215
no community should be saddled
with more environmental burdens

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.905
and less environmental benefits
than any other.

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.976
Unfortunately, race and class
are extremely reliable indicators

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.037
as to where one might find the good stuff,
like parks and trees,

00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:58.793
and where one might find the bad stuff,
like power plants and waste facilities.

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:02.052
As a black person in America,
I am twice as likely as a white person

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:05.673
to live in an area where air pollution
poses the greatest risk to my health.

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.480
I am five times more likely
to live within walking distance

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:10.413
of a power plant or chemical facility,

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:11.594
which I do.

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.780
These land-use decisions
created the hostile conditions

00:03:14.804 --> 00:03:17.796
that lead to problems like obesity,
diabetes and asthma.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.721
Why would someone leave their home to go
for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:24.656
Our 27 percent obesity rate
is high even for this country,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.093
and diabetes comes with it.

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:28.625
One out of four South Bronx
children has asthma.

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.464
Our asthma hospitalization rate

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:32.771
is seven times higher
than the national average.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.746
These impacts are coming everyone's way.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.976
And we all pay dearly
for solid waste costs,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.976
health problems associated
with pollution and more odiously,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.989
the cost of imprisoning
our young black and Latino men,

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:45.768
who possess untold amounts
of untapped potential.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.872
Fifty percent of our residents
live at or below the poverty line;

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.651
25 percent of us are unemployed.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:54.698
Low-income citizens often use
emergency-room visits as primary care.

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:58.621
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers
and produces no proportional benefits.

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:02.488
Poor people are not only still poor,
they are still unhealthy.

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:06.297
Fortunately, there are many people
like me who are striving for solutions

00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:07.821
that won't compromise the lives

00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:10.345
of low-income communities of color
in the short term,

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.475
and won't destroy us all in the long term.

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.985
None of us want that,
and we all have that in common.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.648
So what else do we have in common?

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.450
Well, first of all,
we're all incredibly good-looking.

00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:20.661
(Laughter)

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.472
Graduated high school, college,
post-graduate degrees,

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.808
traveled to interesting places,
didn't have kids in your early teens,

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:29.450
financially stable, never been imprisoned.

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:31.848
OK. Good.

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.211
(Laughter)

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:34.842
But, besides being a black woman,

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:37.528
I am different from most of you
in some other ways.

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:40.943
I watched nearly half of the buildings
in my neighborhood burn down.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:42.930
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.859
only to be gunned down
a few blocks from our home.

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:50.247
Jesus.

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:53.217
I grew up with a crack house
across the street.

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:57.495
Yeah, I'm a poor black child
from the ghetto.

00:04:58.784 --> 00:05:00.951
These things make me different from you.

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:02.838
But the things we have in common

00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:05.601
set me apart from most
of the people in my community,

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.451
and I am in between these two worlds

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:10.362
with enough of my heart
to fight for justice in the other.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:13.323
So how did things get so different for us?

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:16.678
In the late '40s, my dad --
a Pullman porter, son of a slave --

00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:19.569
bought a house in the Hunts Point
section of the South Bronx,

00:05:19.593 --> 00:05:21.608
and a few years later, he married my mom.

00:05:21.632 --> 00:05:25.113
At the time, the community was a mostly
white, working-class neighborhood.

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:26.663
My dad was not alone.

00:05:26.687 --> 00:05:30.124
And as others like him pursued
their own version of the American dream,

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:32.677
white flight became common
in the South Bronx

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:34.701
and in many cities around the country.

00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:38.651
Red-lining was used by banks,
wherein certain sections of the city,

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:42.664
including ours, were deemed
off-limits to any sort of investment.

00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:46.156
Many landlords believed it was more
profitable to torch their buildings

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.351
and collect insurance money rather
than to sell under those conditions --

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.815
dead or injured former tenants
notwithstanding.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.681
Hunts Point was formerly
a walk-to-work community,

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:59.631
but now residents had neither
work nor home to walk to.

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:02.841
A national highway construction boom
was added to our problems.

00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:04.016
In New York State,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.823
Robert Moses spearheaded
an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.

00:06:07.847 --> 00:06:10.043
One of its primary goals was
to make it easier

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:15.092
for residents of wealthy communities
in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:18.191
The South Bronx, which lies in between,
did not stand a chance.

00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:20.765
Residents were often given
less than a month's notice

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.419
before their buildings were razed.

00:06:22.443 --> 00:06:24.767
600,000 people were displaced.

00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:26.101
The common perception was

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:29.976
that only pimps and pushers
and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.930
And if you are told
from your earliest days

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.571
that nothing good is going to come
from your community,

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:36.746
that it's bad and ugly,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.860
how could it not reflect on you?

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.853
So now, my family's property
was worthless,

00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:44.519
save for that it was our home,
and all we had.

00:06:44.543 --> 00:06:48.269
And luckily for me, that home
and the love inside of it,

00:06:48.293 --> 00:06:53.435
along with help from teachers, mentors
and friends along the way, was enough.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.148
Now, why is this story important?

00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:56.982
Because from a planning perspective,

00:06:57.006 --> 00:07:00.723
economic degradation
begets environmental degradation,

00:07:00.747 --> 00:07:03.263
which begets social degradation.

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:06.350
The disinvestment that began
in the 1960s set the stage

00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:08.976
for all the environmental
injustices that were to come.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.976
Antiquated zoning and land-use
regulations are still used to this day

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.043
to continue putting polluting
facilities in my neighborhood.

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:19.845
Are these factors taken into consideration
when land-use policy is decided?

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.465
What costs are associated
with these decisions?

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.725
And who pays? Who profits?

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:28.368
Does anything justify
what the local community goes through?

00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:30.686
This was "planning" -- in quotes --

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.978
that did not have
our best interests in mind.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:36.417
Once we realized that, we decided
it was time to do our own planning.

00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:38.385
That small park I told you about earlier

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:41.687
was the first stage of building
a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:45.063
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million
dollar federal transportation grant

00:07:45.087 --> 00:07:47.195
to design the plan
for a waterfront esplanade

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:48.949
with dedicated on-street bike paths.

00:07:48.973 --> 00:07:52.431
Physical improvements help inform
public policy regarding traffic safety,

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:54.700
the placement of the waste
and other facilities,

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:58.196
which, if done properly, don't compromise
a community's quality of life.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.934
They provide opportunities
to be more physically active,

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.391
as well as local economic development.

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:04.987
Think bike shops, juice stands.

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:07.882
We secured 20 million dollars
to build first-phase projects.

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.780
This is Lafayette Avenue --

00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:12.961
and that's redesigned
by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:16.006
And once this path is constructed,
it'll connect the South Bronx

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.379
with more than 400 acres
of Randall's Island Park.

00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:22.377
Right now we're separated by about 25 feet
of water, but this link will change that.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:26.665
As we nurture the natural environment,
its abundance will give us back even more.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:30.500
We run a project called the Bronx
[Environmental] Stewardship Training,

00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:33.831
which provides job training in the fields
of ecological restoration,

00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:36.656
so that folks from our community
have the skills to compete

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.019
for these well-paying jobs.

00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:41.380
Little by little, we're seeding
the area with green-collar jobs --

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:44.263
and with people that have both
a financial and personal stake

00:08:44.287 --> 00:08:45.444
in their environment.

00:08:45.468 --> 00:08:48.111
The Sheridan Expressway
is an underutilized relic

00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:49.334
of the Robert Moses era,

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:52.734
built with no regard for the neighborhoods
that were divided by it.

00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:55.527
Even during rush hour,
it goes virtually unused.

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:58.223
The community created
an alternative transportation plan

00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.873
that allows for the removal
of the highway.

00:09:00.897 --> 00:09:04.020
We have the opportunity now to bring
together all the stakeholders

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.632
to re-envision how this 28 acres
can be better utilized

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:09.698
for parkland, affordable housing
and local economic development.

00:09:09.722 --> 00:09:14.549
We also built New York City's first green
and cool roof demonstration project

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:15.961
on top of our offices.

00:09:15.985 --> 00:09:19.450
Cool roofs are highly-reflective
surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,

00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:21.577
and pass it on to
the building or atmosphere.

00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.633
Green roofs are soil and living plants.

00:09:23.657 --> 00:09:26.904
Both can be used instead
of petroleum-based roofing materials

00:09:26.928 --> 00:09:29.699
that absorb heat, contribute
to urban "heat island" effect

00:09:29.723 --> 00:09:31.048
and degrade under the sun,

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:32.294
which we in turn breathe.

00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:34.976
Green roofs also retain
up to 75 percent of rainfall,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.659
so they reduce a city's need to fund
costly end-of-pipe solutions --

00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:40.503
which, incidentally, are often located

00:09:40.527 --> 00:09:42.748
in environmental justice
communities like mine.

00:09:42.772 --> 00:09:46.072
And they provide habitats
for our little friends!

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:47.253
[Butterfly]

00:09:47.277 --> 00:09:48.500
(Laughter)

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:49.707
So cool!

00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:52.237
Anyway, the demonstration
project is a springboard

00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.385
for our own green roof
installation business,

00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:57.911
bringing jobs and sustainable
economic activity to the South Bronx.

00:09:57.935 --> 00:09:59.311
[Green is the new black ...]

00:09:59.335 --> 00:10:03.478
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.153
I like that, too.

00:10:05.177 --> 00:10:08.873
Anyway, I know Chris told us
not to do pitches up here,

00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:10.777
but since I have all of your attention:

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.388
We need investors. End of pitch.

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:14.800
It's better to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:15.980
Anyway --

00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:17.464
(Laughter)

00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:22.407
(Applause)

00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:24.694
OK. Katrina.

00:10:25.884 --> 00:10:28.908
Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx
and New Orleans' Ninth Ward

00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:30.121
had a lot in common.

00:10:30.145 --> 00:10:32.899
Both were largely populated
by poor people of color,

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:36.218
both hotbeds of cultural innovation:
think hip-hop and jazz.

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:39.576
Both are waterfront communities
that host both industries and residents

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.486
in close proximity of one another.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.558
In the post-Katrina era,
we have still more in common.

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:48.060
We're at best ignored,
and maligned and abused, at worst,

00:10:48.084 --> 00:10:51.431
by negligent regulatory agencies,
pernicious zoning

00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:53.628
and lax governmental accountability.

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:58.080
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward
nor the South Bronx was inevitable.

00:10:58.104 --> 00:11:00.240
But we have emerged with valuable lessons

00:11:00.264 --> 00:11:02.537
about how to dig ourselves out.

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:06.363
We are more than simply
national symbols of urban blight

00:11:06.387 --> 00:11:09.693
or problems to be solved
by empty campaign promises

00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:11.327
of presidents come and gone.

00:11:11.351 --> 00:11:14.170
Now will we let the Gulf Coast
languish for a decade or two,

00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:15.456
like the South Bronx did?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.964
Or will we take proactive steps

00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:19.925
and learn from the homegrown resource
of grassroots activists

00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:22.795
that have been born of desperation
in communities like mine?

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:25.462
Now listen, I do not expect individuals,

00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:28.271
corporations or government
to make the world a better place

00:11:28.295 --> 00:11:30.119
because it is right or moral.

00:11:30.596 --> 00:11:34.876
This presentation today only represents
some of what I've been through.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.976
Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.096
But I'll tell you later,
if you want to know.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.185
(Laughter)

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:44.499
But -- I know it's the bottom line,
or one's perception of it,

00:11:44.523 --> 00:11:46.259
that motivates people in the end.

00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:49.205
I'm interested in what I like to call
the "triple bottom line"

00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:51.453
that sustainable development can produce.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:55.399
Developments that have the potential
to create positive returns

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:58.525
for all concerned:
the developers, government

00:11:58.549 --> 00:12:00.985
and the community
where these projects go up.

00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:03.549
At present, that's not happening
in New York City.

00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:07.976
And we are operating with a comprehensive
urban-planning deficit.

00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:10.453
A parade of government subsidies

00:12:10.477 --> 00:12:14.029
is going to propose big-box and stadium
developments in the South Bronx,

00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:17.136
but there is scant coordination
between city agencies

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.910
on how to deal with the cumulative effects
of increased traffic, pollution,

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:23.459
solid waste and the impacts on open space.

00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:27.863
And their approaches to local economic
and job development are so lame

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:29.058
it's not even funny.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.281
Because on top of that,

00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:35.728
the world's richest sports team
is replacing the House That Ruth Built

00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:38.569
by destroying two
well-loved community parks.

00:12:38.593 --> 00:12:41.704
Now, we'll have even less
than that stat I told you about earlier.

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:45.046
And although less than 25 percent
of South Bronx residents own cars,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.744
these projects include
thousands of new parking spaces,

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.022
yet zip in terms of mass public transit.

00:12:52.046 --> 00:12:54.078
Now, what's missing from the larger debate

00:12:54.102 --> 00:12:56.031
is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis

00:12:56.055 --> 00:12:59.454
between not fixing an unhealthy,
environmentally-challenged community,

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:03.085
versus incorporating structural,
sustainable changes.

00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:06.340
My agency is working closely
with Columbia University and others

00:13:06.364 --> 00:13:07.950
to shine a light on these issues.

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.173
Now let's get this straight:
I am not anti-development.

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:13.605
Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:16.668
And I've embraced my inner capitalist.

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:18.169
And, but I don't have --

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:19.818
(Laughter)

00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:22.438
You probably all have,
and if you haven't, you need to.

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:26.232
(Laughter)

00:13:26.256 --> 00:13:29.672
So I don't have a problem
with developers making money.

00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:32.646
There's enough precedent out there
to show that a sustainable,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.061
community-friendly development
can still make a fortune.

00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:40.157
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough
and Amory Lovins --

00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:44.150
both heroes of mine by the way --
have shown that you can actually do that.

00:13:44.174 --> 00:13:46.976
I do have a problem
with developments that hyper-exploit

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.167
politically vulnerable
communities for profit.

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:52.039
That it continues is a shame upon us all,

00:13:52.063 --> 00:13:55.004
because we are all responsible
for the future that we create.

00:13:55.028 --> 00:13:58.275
But one of the things I do
to remind myself of greater possibilities,

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:00.433
is to learn from visionaries
in other cities.

00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.489
This is my version of globalization.

00:14:02.513 --> 00:14:04.046
Let's take Bogota.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.863
Poor, Latino, surrounded by
runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;

00:14:07.887 --> 00:14:10.725
a reputation not unlike
that of the South Bronx.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:13.976
However, this city was blessed
in the late 1990s

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.024
with a highly-influential
mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.

00:14:18.048 --> 00:14:19.829
He looked at the demographics.

00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:21.584
Few Bogotanos own cars,

00:14:21.608 --> 00:14:25.646
yet a huge portion of the city's resources
was dedicated to serving them.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.055
If you're a mayor, you can
do something about that.

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:32.335
His administration narrowed key municipal
thoroughfares from five lanes to three,

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:34.622
outlawed parking on those streets,

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:37.425
expanded pedestrian walkways
and bike lanes,

00:14:37.449 --> 00:14:39.380
created public plazas,

00:14:39.404 --> 00:14:42.271
created one of the most efficient
bus mass-transit systems

00:14:42.295 --> 00:14:43.777
in the entire world.

00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:47.575
For his brilliant efforts,
he was nearly impeached.

00:14:48.186 --> 00:14:51.892
But as people began to see
that they were being put first

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:54.126
on issues reflecting
their day-to-day lives,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.481
incredible things happened.

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:56.897
People stopped littering.

00:14:56.921 --> 00:15:00.806
Crime rates dropped, because the streets
were alive with people.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.709
His administration attacked several
typical urban problems at one time,

00:15:04.733 --> 00:15:06.844
and on a third-world budget, at that.

00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:09.567
We have no excuse
in this country, I'm sorry.

00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:12.432
But the bottom line is:
their people-first agenda

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:16.370
was not meant to penalize
those who could actually afford cars,

00:15:16.394 --> 00:15:20.259
but rather, to provide opportunities
for all Bogotanos to participate

00:15:20.283 --> 00:15:21.905
in the city's resurgence.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:24.089
That development should not come

00:15:24.113 --> 00:15:26.700
at the expense of the majority
of the population

00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:29.494
is still considered
a radical idea here in the U.S.

00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:31.976
But Bogota's example
has the power to change that.

00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:35.820
You, however, are blessed
with the gift of influence.

00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:39.566
That's why you're here and why you
value the information we exchange.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.940
Use your influence

00:15:40.964 --> 00:15:44.264
in support of comprehensive,
sustainable change everywhere.

00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:46.262
Don't just talk about it at TED.

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:51.095
This is a nationwide policy agenda
I'm trying to build,

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:53.722
and as you all know,
politics are personal.

00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:56.092
Help me make green the new black.

00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:58.729
Help me make sustainability sexy.

00:15:58.753 --> 00:16:02.150
Make it a part of your dinner
and cocktail conversations.

00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:05.277
Help me fight for environmental
and economic justice.

00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:07.976
Support investments
with a triple-bottom-line return.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.540
Help me democratize sustainability
by bringing everyone to the table,

00:16:12.564 --> 00:16:15.913
and insisting that comprehensive
planning can be addressed everywhere.

00:16:15.937 --> 00:16:17.845
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!

00:16:17.869 --> 00:16:21.814
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore
the other day after breakfast,

00:16:21.838 --> 00:16:26.586
I asked him how environmental justice
activists were going to be included

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.836
in his new marketing strategy.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.168
His response was a grant program.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:36.434
I don't think he understood
that I wasn't asking for funding.

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:40.508
I was making him an offer.

00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:48.745
(Applause)

00:16:49.983 --> 00:16:54.347
What troubled me was that this
top-down approach is still around.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.150
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.

00:16:57.174 --> 00:16:58.586
(Laughter)

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.717
But grassroots groups
are needed at the table

00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.559
during the decision-making process.

00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:09.627
Of the 90 percent of the energy
that Mr. Gore reminded us

00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.073
that we waste every day,

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:14.267
don't add wasting our energy, intelligence

00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:18.134
and hard-earned experience to that count.

00:17:18.158 --> 00:17:23.621
(Applause)

00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:30.113
I have come from so far
to meet you like this.

00:17:31.436 --> 00:17:33.811
Please don't waste me.

00:17:35.628 --> 00:17:36.782
By working together,

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:41.784
we can become one of those small,
rapidly-growing groups of individuals

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.015
who actually have the audacity and courage

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:46.670
to believe that we actually
can change the world.

00:17:47.238 --> 00:17:49.008
We might have come to this conference

00:17:49.032 --> 00:17:51.564
from very, very different
stations in life,

00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:56.188
but believe me, we all share
one incredibly powerful thing.

00:17:58.517 --> 00:18:02.047
We have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:04.851
Ciao, bellos!

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:11.343
(Applause)
