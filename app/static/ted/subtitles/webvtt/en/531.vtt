00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And I promised to come back and give you an update

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
on how that machine worked.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
27 kilometers in circumference.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Its job is to recreate the conditions

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
up to 600 million times a second.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's nothing if not ambitious.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is the machine below Geneva.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so you can see the scale.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It caused immense celebration in the control room.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's a picture of the first beam particle

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
going all the way around the LHC,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and showering particles into the detector.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we knew the machine worked,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which is a great triumph.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or this, when someone went onto Google

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and saw the front page was like that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It means we made cultural impact

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
as well as scientific impact.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
About a week later we had a problem with the machine,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
when the machine is working in full power.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
"No they don't. They're small wires."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They can do that because

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So at minus 271 degrees,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
colder than the space between the stars,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
those wires can take that current.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
there was a manufacturing defect.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So the wire heated up slightly,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This was the result.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now that's more impressive

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and they moved about a foot.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We had to take them out, which we did.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They're all on their way back underground now.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We will switch it on,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and we expect to take data in June or July,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and continue with our quest to find out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
what the building blocks of the universe are.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now of course, in a way

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
those accidents reignite the debate

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I think that the fact that it's so difficult,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
who, I suspect,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
when defending his protege's useless experiments --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
his protege was Michael Faraday --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
said this, "Nothing is so dangerous

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to the progress of the human mind

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that there are no mysteries in nature,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that our triumphs are complete, and that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
there are no new worlds to conquer."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Thank you.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Applause)
