00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But as a physicist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I thought, well if you give me some data,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So as a naive New Zealander

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you get me some information?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No. So I had to think a little harder.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I saw that there was information there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There was data within the streams of news that we consume.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
All this noise around us actually has information.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So what I started thinking was,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we can get enough of these streams of information together,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we can perhaps start to understand the war.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
an interdisciplinary team of scientists,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of economists, mathematicians.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We did it in three steps.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That database contained

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the timing of attacks,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the location, the size and the weapons used.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
we just have to know how to pull it out.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What would that tell us?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So we started doing this. And you can see here

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
on the horizontal axis

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you've got the number of people killed in an attack

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or the size of the attack.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So we plot data for sample on this.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You see some sort of random distribution --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
or 47 attacks where seven people were killed.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You take all of the conflict,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
all of the chaos, all of the noise,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and out of that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
comes this precise mathematical distribution

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This blew our mind.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Why should a conflict like Iraq have this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
as its fundamental signature?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Why should there be order in war?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We didn't really understand that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So we looked at a few more conflicts.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and we looked at Senegal.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This wasn't supposed to happen.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
These are different wars, with different religious factions,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
are the same.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So we went a little wider.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
From Peru to Indonesia,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we studied this same pattern again.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And we found that not only

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
were the distributions these straight lines,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but the slope of these lines, they clustered around

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this value of alpha equals 2.5.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And we could generate an equation

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that could predict the likelihood of an attack.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
What we're saying here

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is the probability of an attack killing X number of people

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in a country like Iraq

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
raised to the power of negative alpha.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So what?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
How do we explain this?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And what we really found was that alpha,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
if we think about it, is the organizational

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
structure of the insurgency.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which is really the distribution

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of the group strength carrying out the attacks.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So we look at a process of group dynamics:

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
coalescence and fragmentation,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
groups coming together, groups breaking apart.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in places like Iraq?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We can run these simulations.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to explain the patterns that we see

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
all around the conflicts around the world.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So what's going on?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
have the same patterns?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now what I believe is going on is that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And it turns out there is only one solution

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to fight a much stronger enemy.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you don't exist.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So every insurgent force that is ongoing,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
every conflict that is ongoing,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it's going to look something like this.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And that is what we think is happening.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Taking it forward, how do we change it?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
How do we end a war like Iraq?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What does it look like?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is what wars look like when they continue.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We've got to change that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We can push it up:

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the forces become more fragmented;

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
there is more of them, but they are weaker.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Or we push it down:

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
they're more robust; there is less groups;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but perhaps you can sit and talk to them.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So this graph here, I'm going to show you now.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
No one has seen this before. This is literally

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
stuff that we've come through last week.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the wars around the world look like.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
until the Samarra bombings in the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Iraqi elections of '06.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to a fragmented state.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is when the surge happens.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And depending on who you ask,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the surge was supposed to push it up even further.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The opposite happened.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The groups became stronger.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
They became more robust.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And this tells me one of two things.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Either we're back where we started

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and the surge has had no effect;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that we can start to think about maybe moving out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I don't know what the answer is to that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to answer that question.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Thank you.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
(Applause)
