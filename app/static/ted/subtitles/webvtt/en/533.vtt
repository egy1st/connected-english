00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:04.047
What I want to do today is spend
some time talking about some stuff

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.656
that's giving me a little bit
of existential angst,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.976
for lack of a better word,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.086
over the past couple of years.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.338
And basically, these three quotes
tell what's going on.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.626
"When God made the color purple,
God was just showing off,"

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.169
Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple."

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.976
And Zora Neale Hurston wrote
in "Dust Tracks On A Road,"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.826
"Research is a formalized curiosity.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.502
It's poking and prying with a purpose."

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:34.437
And then finally,
when I think about the near future,

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.743
we have this attitude, "Well,
whatever happens, happens."

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:38.928
Right?

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:41.490
So that goes along with
the Cheshire Cat saying,

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:43.872
"If you don't care much
where you want to get to,

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:46.038
it doesn't much matter which way you go."

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:50.356
But I think it does matter which way
we go and what road we take,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.224
because when I think
about design in the near future,

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:55.555
what I think are the most
important issues,

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.552
what's really crucial and vital,

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:02.362
is that we need to revitalize
the arts and sciences right now,

00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:03.890
in 2002.

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:07.034
(Applause)

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:13.218
If we describe the near future
as 10, 20, 15 years from now,

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:17.061
that means that what we do today
is going to be critically important,

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:21.066
because in the year 2015,
in the year 2020, 2025,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.760
the world our society
is going to be building on,

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.256
the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.381
the discoveries
that we came up with today,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:32.369
just as all these wonderful things
we're hearing about

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:33.649
here at the TED conference

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:36.460
that we take for granted
in the world right now,

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:39.047
were really knowledge
and ideas that came up

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.398
in the 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:44.227
That's the substrate
that we're exploiting today.

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.575
Whether it's the internet,

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.442
genetic engineering, laser scanners,

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.715
guided missiles, fiber optics,
high-definition television,

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:55.835
remote sensing from space
and the wonderful remote-sensing photos

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.666
that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs
like Tracker and Enterprise,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.085
CD-rewrite drives, flat-screen,
Alvin Ailey's "Suite Otis,"

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.690
or Sarah Jones's "Your Revolution Will
Not [Happen] Between These Thighs,"

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.684
which, by the way, was banned by the FCC,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.859
or ska --

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:16.159
all of these things, without question,
almost without exception,

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:19.939
are really based on ideas
and abstract and creativity

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.554
from years before.

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:23.048
So we have to ask ourselves:

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:26.081
What are we contributing
to that legacy right now?

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:27.658
And when I think about it,

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:28.836
I'm really worried.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.989
To be quite frank, I'm concerned.

00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:33.832
I'm skeptical that we're doing
very much of anything.

00:02:34.263 --> 00:02:36.026
We're, in a sense,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.676
failing to act in the future.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.859
We're purposefully,
consciously being laggards.

00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:43.318
We're lagging behind.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.725
Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist
from Martinique, said,

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.671
"Each generation must,
out of relative obscurity,

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:51.389
discover its mission

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.474
and fulfill or betray it."

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:57.333
What is our mission?
What do we have to do?

00:02:57.357 --> 00:03:00.829
I think our mission is
to reconcile, to reintegrate

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:03.202
science and the arts,

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:07.953
because right now, there's a schism
that exists in popular culture.

00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:12.223
People have this idea that science
and the arts are really separate;

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:14.600
we think of them as separate
and different things.

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:17.809
And this idea was probably
introduced centuries ago,

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.890
but it's really becoming critical now,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.237
because we're making decisions
about our society every day

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:30.470
that, if we keep thinking that the arts
are separate from the sciences,

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:32.351
and we keep thinking it's cute to say,

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.447
"I don't understand
anything about this one,

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.852
I don't understand anything
about the other one,"

00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:38.528
then we're going to have problems.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.591
Now, I know no one
here at TED thinks this.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:43.231
All of us, we already know
that they're very connected.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:46.450
But I'm going to let you know
that some folks in the outside world,

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:48.818
believe it or not,
think it's neat when they say,

00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:52.112
"Scientists and science is not creative.

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:55.002
Maybe scientists are ingenious,
but they're not creative."

00:03:55.473 --> 00:03:56.966
And then we have this tendency,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.514
the career counselors
and various people say things

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:02.151
like, "Artists are not analytical.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.846
They're ingenious, perhaps,

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.117
but not analytical."

00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:09.453
And when these concepts
underlie our teaching

00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:11.373
and what we think about the world,

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:12.723
then we have a problem,

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:14.857
because we stymie support for everything.

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:16.501
By accepting this dichotomy,

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:18.636
whether it's tongue-in-cheek,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.201
when we attempt
to accommodate it in our world,

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.580
and we try to build
our foundation for the world,

00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:25.142
we're messing up the future,

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.534
because: Who wants to be uncreative?

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:29.754
Who wants to be illogical?

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:31.842
Talent would run
from either of these fields

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.639
if you said you had to choose either.

00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:35.876
Then they'll go to something
where they think,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.506
"Well, I can be creative
and logical at the same time."

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.193
Now, I grew up in the '60s
and I'll admit it --

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:44.269
actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:45.943
and I was a wannabe hippie,

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:50.492
and I always resented the fact
that I wasn't old enough to be a hippie.

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:53.387
And I know there are people here,
the younger generation,

00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.875
who want to be hippies.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.953
People talk about the '60s all the time.

00:04:56.977 --> 00:04:59.184
And they talk about the anarchy
that was there.

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.804
But when I think about the '60s,

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:04.566
what I took away from it was
that there was hope for the future.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.640
We thought everyone could participate.

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:10.689
There were wonderful, incredible ideas
that were always percolating,

00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:13.751
and so much of what's cool or hot today

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:15.823
is really based on some of those concepts,

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:19.387
whether it's people trying to use
the Prime Directive from Star Trek,

00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:21.258
being involved in things,

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:24.348
or, again, that three-dimensional
weaving and fax machines

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:26.230
that I read about in my weekly readers

00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:29.181
that the technology and engineering
was just getting started.

00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:30.961
But the '60s left me with a problem.

00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:35.630
You see, I always assumed
I would go into space,

00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:37.320
because I followed all of this.

00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:40.143
But I also loved the arts and sciences.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:43.291
You see, when I was growing up
as a little girl and as a teenager,

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:45.770
I loved designing and making doll clothes

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:47.585
and wanting to be a fashion designer.

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:48.907
I took art and ceramics.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:54.523
I loved dance: Lola Falana,
Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:59.257
And I also avidly followed
the Gemini and the Apollo programs.

00:05:59.281 --> 00:06:02.648
I had science projects
and tons of astronomy books.

00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:04.282
I took calculus and philosophy.

00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:08.042
I wondered about infinity
and the Big Bang theory.

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:11.273
And when I was at Stanford,
I found myself, my senior year,

00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:12.603
chemical engineering major,

00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:16.159
half the folks thought I was a political
science and performing arts major,

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:19.422
which was sort of true, because I was
Black Student Union President,

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.223
and I did major in some other things.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.931
And I found myself the last quarter

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.360
juggling chemical engineering
separation processes,

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.562
logic classes, nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy,

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:32.107
and also producing and choreographing
a dance production.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.260
And I had to do the lighting
and the design work,

00:06:35.284 --> 00:06:37.568
and I was trying to figure out:

00:06:37.592 --> 00:06:40.827
Do I go to New York City
to try to become a professional dancer,

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:42.509
or to go to medical school?

00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:44.770
Now, my mother helped
me figure that one out.

00:06:44.794 --> 00:06:47.889
(Laughter)

00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:52.567
But when I went into space,
I carried a number of things up with me.

00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:54.369
I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey --

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:56.836
you can figure out now,
I love the dance company --

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.240
an Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison
performing the dance "Cry,"

00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:02.301
dedicated to all black women everywhere;

00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:06.064
a Bundu statue, which was from
the women's society in Sierra Leone;

00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:08.727
and a certificate for the Chicago
Public School students

00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:11.904
to work to improve their science and math.

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:13.865
And folks asked me,

00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:16.736
"Why did you take up what you took up?"

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:18.533
And I had to say,

00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:21.110
"Because it represents human creativity;

00:07:21.134 --> 00:07:23.581
the creativity that allowed us,

00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:26.531
that we were required to have
to conceive and build and launch

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:27.721
the space shuttle,

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:30.853
which springs from the same source
as the imagination and analysis

00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:32.974
that it took to carve a Bundu statue,

00:07:32.998 --> 00:07:38.314
or the ingenuity it took to design,
choreograph and stage "Cry."

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.512
Each one of them are different
manifestations, incarnations,

00:07:42.536 --> 00:07:46.332
of creativity --
avatars of human creativity.

00:07:46.784 --> 00:07:49.138
And that's what we have to
reconcile in our minds,

00:07:49.162 --> 00:07:50.616
how these things fit together.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.014
The difference between arts and sciences
is not analytical versus intuitive.

00:07:55.038 --> 00:07:56.189
Right?

00:07:56.213 --> 00:08:00.005
E = mc2 required an intuitive leap,

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:02.369
and then you had to do
the analysis afterwards.

00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:04.502
Einstein said, in fact,

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.690
"The most beautiful thing
we can experience

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.018
is the mysterious.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.844
It is the source
of all true art and science."

00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:14.288
Dance requires us to express
and want to express

00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:15.479
the jubilation in life,

00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:17.082
but then you have to figure out:

00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:18.523
Exactly what movement do I do

00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:20.664
to make sure it comes across correctly?

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:22.628
The difference between arts and sciences

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:26.169
is also not constructive
versus deconstructive.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:28.852
A lot of people think of the sciences
as deconstructive,

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.477
you have to pull things apart.

00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:33.563
And yeah, subatomic physics
is deconstructive --

00:08:33.587 --> 00:08:36.191
you literally try to tear atoms apart

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.251
to understand what's inside of them.

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:41.826
But sculpture, from what I understand
from great sculptors,

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.031
is deconstructive,

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:46.376
because you see a piece and you remove
what doesn't need to be there.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.167
Biotechnology is constructive.

00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:51.127
Orchestral arranging is constructive.

00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:54.262
So, in fact, we use constructive
and deconstructive techniques

00:08:54.286 --> 00:08:55.441
in everything.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.409
The difference
between science and the arts

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:02.864
is not that they are different sides
of the same coin, even,

00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:05.186
or even different parts
of the same continuum,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.581
but rather, they're manifestations
of the same thing.

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:11.967
Different quantum states of an atom?

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:14.038
Or maybe if I want to be
more 21st century,

00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:17.470
I could say that they're different
harmonic resonances of a superstring.

00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:18.838
But we'll leave that alone.

00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:20.540
They spring from the same source.

00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:24.272
The arts and sciences are avatars
of human creativity.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:25.772
It's our attempt as humans

00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:29.273
to build an understanding
of the universe, the world around us.

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:31.803
It's our attempt to influence things,

00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:33.958
the universe internal to ourselves

00:09:33.982 --> 00:09:35.477
and external to us.

00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:41.107
The sciences, to me, are manifestations
of our attempt to express or share

00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:43.819
our understanding, our experience,

00:09:43.843 --> 00:09:46.677
to influence the universe
external to ourselves.

00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:49.813
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.

00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:52.647
It's the universe,
as experienced by everyone.

00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:55.576
The arts manifest our desire,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.907
our attempt to share or influence others

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.545
through experiences
that are peculiar to us as individuals.

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:03.937
Let me say it again another way:

00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:08.386
science provides an understanding
of a universal experience,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.626
and arts provide a universal understanding

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.549
of a personal experience.

00:10:14.502 --> 00:10:16.537
That's what we have to think about,

00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:19.471
that they're all part of us,
they're all part of a continuum.

00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:22.697
It's not just the tools,
it's not just the sciences,

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.695
the mathematics and the numerical stuff
and the statistics,

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:27.764
because we heard, very much on this stage,

00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:30.207
people talked about music
being mathematical.

00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:33.216
Arts don't just use clay,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.421
aren't the only ones that use clay,
light and sound and movement.

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:41.167
They use analysis as well.

00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:42.806
So people might say,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.713
"Well, I still like that intuitive
versus analytical thing,"

00:10:45.737 --> 00:10:48.768
because everybody wants to do
the right brain, left brain thing.

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:51.681
We've all been accused of being
right-brained or left-brained

00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:52.865
at some point in time,

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:54.709
depending on who we disagreed with.

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:56.057
(Laughter)

00:10:56.081 --> 00:10:57.975
You know, people say "intuitive" --

00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:59.934
that's like you're in touch with nature,

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.943
in touch with yourself and relationships;

00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:04.200
analytical, you put your mind to work.

00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:07.293
I'm going to tell you a little secret.
You all know this, though.

00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:09.416
But sometimes people use
this analysis idea,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.272
that things are outside of ourselves,

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.750
to say, this is what
we're going to elevate

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.828
as the true, most important
sciences, right?

00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:21.311
Then you have artists -- and you all know
this is true as well --

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:24.646
artists will say things about scientists

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.706
because they say they're too concrete,
they're disconnected from the world.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.308
But, we've even had that here on stage,

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:34.073
so don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

00:11:34.097 --> 00:11:35.291
(Laughter)

00:11:35.315 --> 00:11:37.655
We had folks talking
about the Flat Earth Society

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.854
and flower arrangers,

00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:40.792
so there's this whole dichotomy

00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:43.753
that we continue to carry along,
even when we know better.

00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:47.114
And folks say we need to choose either-or.

00:11:48.162 --> 00:11:51.068
But it would really be foolish
to choose either one,

00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:53.106
intuitive versus analytical.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.317
That's a foolish choice.

00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:58.844
It's foolish just like trying to choose
between being realistic or idealistic.

00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:00.413
You need both in life.

00:12:00.837 --> 00:12:01.993
Why do people do this?

00:12:02.017 --> 00:12:04.722
I'm going to quote
a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:06.629
who's 70 years old, so he can say this.

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:09.866
He said, "It's always important
to distinguish between chastity

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.114
and impotence."

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.685
Now --

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:14.812
(Laughter)

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:20.646
I want to share with you
a little equation, OK?

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.867
How does understanding science
and the arts fit into our lives

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.046
and what's going on

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.173
and the things we're talking about
here at the design conference?

00:12:30.197 --> 00:12:32.275
And this is a little thing I came up with:

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:33.466
understanding

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.333
and our resources and our will

00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:37.155
cause us to have outcomes.

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:40.263
Our understanding is our science,
our arts, our religion;

00:12:40.287 --> 00:12:42.622
how we see the universe around us;

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:45.343
our resources, our money,
our labor, our minerals --

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.531
those things that are out there
in the world we have to work with.

00:12:48.555 --> 00:12:50.531
But more importantly, there's our will.

00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:52.371
This is our vision,

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.984
our aspirations of the future,
our hopes, our dreams,

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:56.389
our struggles and our fears.

00:12:56.413 --> 00:13:00.112
Our successes and our failures influence
what we do with all of those.

00:13:00.136 --> 00:13:04.257
And to me, design and engineering,
craftsmanship and skilled labor,

00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:07.455
are all the things that work
on this to have our outcome,

00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:09.287
which is our human quality of life.

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:12.043
Where do we want the world to be?

00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:13.613
And guess what?

00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:15.285
Regardless of how we look at this,

00:13:15.309 --> 00:13:18.266
whether we look at arts and sciences
as separate or different,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.515
they're both being influenced now
and they're both having problems.

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:23.628
I did a project called
S.E.E.ing the Future:

00:13:23.652 --> 00:13:25.349
Science, Engineering and Education.

00:13:25.373 --> 00:13:27.079
It was looking at how to shed light

00:13:27.103 --> 00:13:29.372
on the most effective use
of government funding.

00:13:29.396 --> 00:13:32.262
We got a bunch of scientists
in all stages of their careers.

00:13:32.286 --> 00:13:34.784
They came to Dartmouth College,
where I was teaching.

00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:37.444
And they talked about,
with theologians and financiers:

00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:39.593
What are some of the issues
of public funding

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:41.441
for science and engineering research?

00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:43.066
What's most important about it?

00:13:43.738 --> 00:13:45.342
There are some ideas that emerged

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.014
that I think have really
powerful parallels to the arts.

00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:50.538
The first thing they said
was that the circumstances

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:53.960
that we find ourselves in today
in the sciences and engineering

00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:55.563
that made us world leaders

00:13:55.587 --> 00:14:00.844
are very different than the '40s,
the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s,

00:14:00.868 --> 00:14:02.480
when we emerged as world leaders,

00:14:02.504 --> 00:14:04.957
because we're no longer
in competition with fascism,

00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:06.376
with Soviet-style communism.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.772
And by the way, that competition
wasn't just military;

00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:14.229
it included social competition
and political competition as well,

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:17.861
that allowed us to look at space
as one of those platforms

00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:20.226
to prove that our social
system was better.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.567
Another thing they talked
about was that the infrastructure

00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:24.936
that supports the sciences

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.258
is becoming obsolete.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.778
We look at universities and colleges --

00:14:28.802 --> 00:14:31.960
small, mid-sized community colleges
across the country --

00:14:31.984 --> 00:14:34.398
their laboratories are becoming obsolete.

00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:37.072
And this is where we train
most of our science workers

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:40.330
and our researchers --
and our teachers, by the way.

00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:45.107
And there's a media that doesn't support
the dissemination of any more than

00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:48.019
the most mundane and inane of information.

00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:51.461
There's pseudoscience, crop circles,
alien autopsy, haunted houses,

00:14:51.485 --> 00:14:52.703
or disasters.

00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:54.101
And that's what we see.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:57.448
This isn't really the information you need
to operate in everyday life

00:14:57.472 --> 00:14:59.864
and figure out how to participate
in this democracy

00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:01.590
and determine what's going on.

00:15:01.614 --> 00:15:04.379
They also said there's a change
in the corporate mentality.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.565
Whereas government money
had always been there

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:08.680
for basic science
and engineering research,

00:15:08.704 --> 00:15:12.466
we also counted on some companies
to do some basic research.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.311
But what's happened now
is companies put more energy

00:15:15.335 --> 00:15:17.870
into short-term product development

00:15:18.637 --> 00:15:21.845
than they do in basic engineering
and science research.

00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:26.083
And education is not keeping up.

00:15:26.107 --> 00:15:29.766
In K through 12, people
are taking out wet labs.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.866
They think if we put
a computer in the room,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.162
it's going to take the place
of actually mixing the acids

00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:36.685
or growing the potatoes.

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:39.017
And government funding
is decreasing in spending,

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:41.836
and then they're saying,
let's have corporations take over,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.016
and that's not true.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.226
Government funding
should at least do things

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.181
like recognize cost benefits
of basic science and engineering research.

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:53.298
We have to know that we have
a responsibility as global citizens

00:15:53.322 --> 00:15:54.480
in this world.

00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:56.550
We have to look at
the education of humans.

00:15:56.574 --> 00:15:59.909
We need to build our resources today
to make sure that they're trained

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:02.307
so they understand
the importance of these things.

00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.555
And we have to support
the vitality of science.

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:09.502
That doesn't mean that everything has
to have one thing that's going to go on,

00:16:09.526 --> 00:16:12.400
or that we know exactly what's going
to be the outcome of it,

00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:15.483
but that we support the vitality
and the intellectual curiosity

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:16.755
that goes along [with it].

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:19.302
And if you think about
those parallels to the arts --

00:16:19.326 --> 00:16:23.396
the competition
with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.669
the Joffrey and the New York
City Ballet to become better.

00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:30.895
Infrastructure, museums, theaters,
movie houses across the country

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:32.071
are disappearing.

00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:34.534
We have more television stations
with less to watch,

00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:38.317
we have more money spent on rewrites

00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:40.226
to get old television programs

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.607
in the movies.

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.773
We have corporate funding now that,

00:16:44.797 --> 00:16:48.158
when it goes to support the arts,

00:16:48.182 --> 00:16:51.361
it almost requires that the product
be part of the picture

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.682
that the artist draws.

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:56.611
We have stadiums that are named
over and over again by corporations.

00:16:56.635 --> 00:17:00.417
In Houston, we're trying to figure out
what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.

00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:01.460
(Laughter)

00:17:01.484 --> 00:17:04.365
Fine arts and education
in the schools is disappearing,

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:08.119
And we have a government
that seems like it's gutting the NEA

00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:09.306
and other programs.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.429
So we have to really stop and think:

00:17:11.453 --> 00:17:14.485
What are we trying to do
with the sciences and the arts?

00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:16.382
There's a need to revitalize them.

00:17:16.406 --> 00:17:17.977
We have to pay attention to it.

00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.758
I just want to tell you quickly
what I'm doing --

00:17:21.091 --> 00:17:26.971
(Applause)

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:31.447
I want to tell you what I've been doing
a little bit since ...

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:35.430
I feel this need to sort of
integrate some of the ideas

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.854
that I've had and run across over time.

00:17:37.878 --> 00:17:42.226
One of the things that I found out
is that there's a need to repair

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.813
the dichotomy between the mind
and body as well.

00:17:44.837 --> 00:17:47.486
My mother always told me,
you have to be observant,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.752
know what's going on
in your mind and your body.

00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:53.450
And as a dancer, I had this tremendous
faith in my ability to know my body,

00:17:53.474 --> 00:17:55.450
just as I knew how to sense colors.

00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:57.615
Then I went to medical school,

00:17:58.297 --> 00:18:02.488
and I was supposed to just go on
what the machine said about bodies.

00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:06.060
You know, you would ask patients questions
and some people would tell you,

00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:07.992
"Don't listen to what the patient said."

00:18:08.016 --> 00:18:10.960
We know that patients know
and understand their bodies better,

00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:14.494
but these days we're trying
to divorce them from that idea.

00:18:14.518 --> 00:18:18.410
We have to reconcile
the patient's knowledge of their body

00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:20.027
with physicians' measurements.

00:18:21.328 --> 00:18:24.245
We had someone talk about
measuring emotions

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:28.226
and getting machines to figure out
what to keep us from acting crazy.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.415
No, we shouldn't measure.

00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:32.748
We shouldn't use machines
to measure road rage

00:18:32.772 --> 00:18:35.281
and then do something to keep
us from engaging in it.

00:18:35.305 --> 00:18:39.273
Maybe we can have machines help us
to recognize that we have road rage,

00:18:39.297 --> 00:18:42.478
and then we need to know
how to control that without the machines.

00:18:42.502 --> 00:18:45.763
We even need to be able to recognize that
without the machines.

00:18:45.787 --> 00:18:48.289
What I'm very concerned about is:

00:18:48.313 --> 00:18:53.962
How do we bolster our self-awareness
as humans, as biological organisms?

00:18:53.986 --> 00:18:56.795
Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach

00:18:56.819 --> 00:19:01.396
and learn how to feel with my eyes,
to see with my hands.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.407
We have all kinds of possibilities
to use our senses by,

00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:07.580
and that's what we have to do.

00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:09.435
That's what I want to do --

00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:12.836
to try to use bioinstrumentation,
those kind of things,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.945
to help our senses in what we do.

00:19:15.969 --> 00:19:17.688
That's the work I've been doing now,

00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:19.774
as a company called
BioSentient Corporation.

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:22.721
I figured I'd have to do that ad,
because I'm an entrepreneur,

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:26.896
and "entrepreneur" says "somebody
who does what they want to do,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.097
because they're not broke enough
that they have to get a real job."

00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:31.123
(Laughter)

00:19:31.147 --> 00:19:33.737
But that's the work I'm doing,
BioSentient Corporation,

00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:36.357
trying to figure out:
How do we integrate these things?

00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:41.058
Let me finish by saying that
my personal design issue for the future

00:19:41.082 --> 00:19:43.044
is really about integrating;

00:19:43.068 --> 00:19:45.885
to think about that intuitive
and that analytical.

00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:48.214
The arts and sciences are not separate.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.530
High school physics
lesson before you leave:

00:19:51.554 --> 00:19:53.944
high school physics teacher
used to hold up a ball.

00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:56.688
She would say, "This ball
has potential energy.

00:19:56.712 --> 00:19:59.215
But nothing will happen to it,
it can't do any work,

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:01.286
until I drop it and it changes states."

00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:04.738
I like to think of ideas
as potential energy.

00:20:04.762 --> 00:20:06.598
They're really wonderful,

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:10.892
but nothing will happen
until we risk putting them into action.

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:14.707
This conference is filled
with wonderful ideas.

00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:17.629
We're going to share
lots of things with people.

00:20:17.653 --> 00:20:19.366
But nothing's going to happen

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.508
until we risk putting
those ideas into action.

00:20:22.532 --> 00:20:25.260
We need to revitalize
the arts and sciences today.

00:20:25.284 --> 00:20:27.779
We need to take responsibility
for the future.

00:20:27.803 --> 00:20:31.427
We can't hide behind saying
it's just for company profits,

00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:32.678
or it's just a business,

00:20:32.702 --> 00:20:34.947
or I'm an artist or an academician.

00:20:35.709 --> 00:20:37.741
Here's how you judge what you're doing:

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:41.226
I talked about that balance
between intuitive, analytical.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.058
Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,

00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:47.665
said, "The three questions
of greatest concern ..." --

00:20:47.689 --> 00:20:49.556
now I'm going to add on to design --

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.756
"... are: Is it attractive?"

00:20:52.969 --> 00:20:54.663
That's the intuitive.

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:57.278
"Is it amusing?" -- the analytical,

00:20:57.302 --> 00:20:59.987
and, "Does it know
its place?" -- the balance.

00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:01.183
Thank you very much.

00:21:01.207 --> 00:21:03.865
(Applause)
