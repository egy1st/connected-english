00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a sculpture I made,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
into an object that has different degrees of freedom.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, it can balance on a point.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is a bronze ball,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
an aluminum arm here,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then this wooden disk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the wooden disk was really thought about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as something that you'd want to hold on to,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that would glide easily through your hands.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The aluminum is because it's very light.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The bronze is nice hard, durable material

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that could roll on the ground.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Inside of the bronze ball

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
there's a lead weight

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that is free-swinging on an axle

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that's on two bearings

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that pass in between, across it,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
like this, that counterbalance this weight.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So it allows it to roll.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And the sphere has that balance property

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that it always sort of stays still

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and looks the same from every direction.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But if you put something on top of it,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But in this case because

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the interior is free-swinging

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in relation to the sphere,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it can stand up on one point.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then there was a second level to this object,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which is that it --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which is the diameter of the Moon

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the diameter of the Earth

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in proportion to each other.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I was exploring, really early on,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
wanting to make things float in the air.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I thought up a lot of ideas.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is sculpture that I made that --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
it's magnetically levitated.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
without, um -- oops.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So this is just floating,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
floating on a permanent magnetic field,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which stabilizes it in all directions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Except there is a slight tether here,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which keeps it from going over the top of its field.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
at the crest of a wave.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I think we could roll the tape, admin.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I have a sort of a collection of videos

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is a sculpture of the Sun

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and the Earth, in proportion.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Representing that eight and a half minutes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that was turned of solid bronze.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And here is a similar sculpture.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's the Sun at that end.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And then in a series of 55 balls,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it reduces, proportionately -- each ball

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the spaces between them

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
reduce proportionately,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
until they get down to this little Earth.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
This one is about the Moon

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This is a little stone ball, floating.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
As you can see the little tether,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that it's also magnetically levitated.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then this is the first part of --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this is 109 spheres,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so this is the size of the Sun.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And then each of these little spheres

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So this, again, is on the subject --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
a slice from the equator of the Earth.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And then the Moon in the center,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and it's floating. And this is in France.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is in Sapporo.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
which means that the lower half of the object

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
is just a little bit more weighty.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So you can see it rotating here.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
This is another species of work that I do.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but they have magnets horizontally in them

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that make them all like compasses.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So as you turn around you're seeing different colors.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is based on the structure of a diamond.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It was a diamond cell structure

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
was the point of departure.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
between the atoms.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And so I placed one more element of each one of them.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
These were white spheres.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Then I had video projectors

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So they would catch parts of the images,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
as you walk through it, through the object.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This is something I did

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
of a tactile communication system.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and then putting it into a communication system.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that would be directed around the room

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
by a computer.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This is a clock I designed.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then, this is like

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
projects that are harder to build.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
(Laughter)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So it's a floating island

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
with water, fresh water,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that can fly from place to place.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This would be grown, I suppose,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
with nanotechnology in the future sometime.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
In the course of doing my work

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I sort of have a broad range of interests.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And some of it is just the idea of creating media --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
media as a sculpture,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
something that would keep the sculpture

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
fresh and ever-changing,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I had a lot of --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And the idea that you could see things

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
inside of a crystal ball and predict the future --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
where anything can appear.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I had thought about, a long time ago,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
grand project for an electric globe

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
across from the United Nations --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and other things that were happening,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the space program at that time,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So if we could roll the next film here.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
This has evolved over the years

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
in a lot of different iterations.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But this the current version of it,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is a flying airship

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that is about 35 meters in diameter,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
about 110 feet in diameter.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
red, blue, and green,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I came with a plan.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to do a feasibility study,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and they analyzed it,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
This is the control room inside of the ship.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The idea of this air genie is,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it's something that can just transform and become anything.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It's like a traveling show.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
over the surface of it.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So it can see its environment,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Here the legs are retracting.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It weighs about 20 tons.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It has on-board generators.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It can generate about a million kilowatts,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in order to be bright enough

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to be visible in daylight.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that would allow the thing to become

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
actually kind of a conscious object

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that would respond to the moment,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and to interact as an entity

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that was aware, that could communicate.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It's completely silent and nonpolluting.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Primarily I would be interested in

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
how it would interact with, say,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
going to a college campus,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the world, the situation of the globe.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The default image on the object

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But then one could interact with that

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations --

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
all of the things that we're concerned with today.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And then at night the idea is that

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
it would be used as kind of a rave situation,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
where the people could cut loose,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and the music and the lights, and everything.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So it could land in a park, for example.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Or this could represent a college green.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And then it would have a corresponding website

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that would show the itinerary of this.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It would also be able to be an open code,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
so people could interact with it.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It would be forum for people's ideas about

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So that's pretty much it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Okay. Thank you.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Applause)
