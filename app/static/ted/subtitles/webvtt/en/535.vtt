00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last year I showed these two slides so that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which for most of the last three million years

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
has been the size of the lower 48 states,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has shrunk by 40 percent.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the beating heart of the global climate system.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The next slide I show you will be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The permanent ice is marked in red.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
As you see, it expands to the dark blue --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's the annual ice in winter,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and it contracts in summer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
you can see is almost like blood,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
spilling out of the body here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a problem because the warming

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Video: Whoa! (Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
heats up Greenland from the north.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is an annual melting river.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But the volumes are much larger than ever.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If you want to know how sea level rises

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
from land-base ice melting

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
this is where it reaches the sea.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
These flows are increasing very rapidly.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the largest mass of ice on the planet.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Last month scientists reported the entire continent

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is now in negative ice balance.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is particularly rapid in its melting.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
40 percent of all the people in the world

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
In the Andes, this glacier is the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
source of drinking water for this city.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The flows have increased.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In California there has been a 40 percent

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
decline in the Sierra snowpack.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is hitting the reservoirs.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This drying around the world has lead to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a dramatic increase in fires.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And the disasters around the world

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and unprecedented rate.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Four times as many in the last 30 years

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
as in the previous 75.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is a completely unsustainable pattern.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
If you look at in the context of history

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
you can see what this is doing.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In the last five years

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
we've added 70 million tons of CO2

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
every 24 hours --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
25 million tons every day to the oceans.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
from the Americas, extending westward,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and on either side of the Indian subcontinent,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The biggest single cause of global warming,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The United States is one of the two

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
largest emitters, along with China.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But we're beginning to see a sea change.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with some green alternatives proposed.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Applause)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
However there is a political battle

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in our country.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the coal industries and the oil industries

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
promoting clean coal,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
which is an oxymoron.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That image reminded me of something.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
(Laughter)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You probably saw it on the news.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This happened around Christmas.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
He's abundant here in America,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and he helps our economy grow.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
has launched two campaigns.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
This is one of them, part of one of them.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
threat to our business.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That's why we've made it our primary goal

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to spend a large sum of money

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the truth about coal.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The fact is, coal isn't dirty.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We think it's clean --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
smells good, too.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So don't worry about climate change.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Leave that up to us.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
(Laughter)

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Video: Actor: Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the remarkable clean coal technology you see here

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
changes everything.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
meshes with our economic challenge

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and our national security challenge.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Video: Narrator: America is in crisis -- the economy,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
national security, the climate crisis.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The thread that links them all:

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
our addiction to carbon based fuels,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
like dirty coal and foreign oil.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
within 10 years.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
A plan to put America back to work,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
make us more secure, and help stop global warming.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Repower America. Find out more.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Al Gore: This is the last one.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"If you want to go quickly, go alone.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
If you want to go far, go together."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We need to go far, quickly.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Thank you very much.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
(Applause)
