WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I got invited to speak to the people

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to perform at sporting events.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Unfortunately I couldn't go.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But it got me thinking about

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the fact that these guys, at least most of them,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
know what it is that they do for a living.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What they do is they dress up

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Shortly after that I got invited

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to speak at the convention of the people

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who make balloon animals.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There is a big schism between the ones who make

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
gospel animals and porn animals, but --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And the other thing about these guys

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is, they also know what they do for a living.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They make balloon animals.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But what do we do for a living?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What exactly to the people watching this do every day?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I want to argue that what we do

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is we try to change everything.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That we try to find a piece of the status quo --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We try to make big, permanent, important change.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But we don't think about it that way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what that process is like.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I've been studying it for a couple years.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I want to share a couple stories with you today.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Cities gave them a charter

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Nathan and his boss saw this,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and they could not tolerate it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So they set out to make San Francisco

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a no-kill city:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
create an entire city

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where every dog and cat,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
unless it was ill or dangerous,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
would be adopted, not killed.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And everyone said it was impossible.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
flew to San Francisco

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to testify against them --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
He connected with people who cared about this:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
nonprofessionals, people with passion.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And within just a couple years,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
San Francisco became the first no-kill city,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
running no deficit, completely supported by the community.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a place as different from San Francisco

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to completely transforming the community.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And he went to Reno and he did it again.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And when I think about what Nathan did,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I think about the idea that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
creating an idea, spreading an idea

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
has a lot behind it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but what they do is, they take a light bulb

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and they smash it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But one reason is because it indicates a change,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
from before to after.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It is a moment in time.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And I want to argue that we are living through

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and are right at the key moment

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of a change in the way ideas are created

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and spread and implemented.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We started with the factory idea:

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that could churn out change.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We then went to the TV idea,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
if you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And now we're in this new model of leadership,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
where the way we make change

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is not by using money

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
or power to lever a system,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but by leading.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It enables him to hire men

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
who used to get paid 50 cents a day

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and pay them five dollars a day.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Because he's got an efficient enough factory.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Well with that sort of advantage

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
you can churn out a lot of cars.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You can change the fabric of an entire country.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That the essence of what you're doing is you need

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
ever-cheaper labor,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and ever-faster machines.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So we shift gears for a minute,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and say, "I know: television;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
advertising. Push push.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Take a good idea and push it on the world.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I have a better mousetrap.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And you can build an entire industry on that.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But be careful.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This model requires you to act like the king,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
like the person in the front of the room

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
throwing things to the peons in the back.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That you are in charge, and you're going to tell people

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
what to do next.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and you are pushing it out to the world.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
This method -- mass marketing --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
requires average ideas,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because you're going to the masses,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and plenty of ads.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
What we've done as spammers

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is tried to hypnotize everyone

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
into buying our idea,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
(Laughter)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But there is good news around the corner -- really good news.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I call it the idea of tribes.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
What tribes are, is a very simple concept

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that goes back 50,000 years.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And it's something that people have wanted forever.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
having a work tribe,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
having a community tribe.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
thanks to a lot of other things

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that are bubbling through our society around the world,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
tribes are everywhere.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You've got the organized armies over here.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You've got the disorganized rebels over here.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You've got people in white hats making food.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And people in white hats sailing boats.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and connect with them,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
because you want to be connected.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That people on the fringes

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
can find each other, connect and go somewhere.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Every town that has a volunteer fire department

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
understands this way of thinking.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Now it turns out

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And that what firemen do to train sometimes

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
is they take a house that is going to be torn down,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But they always stop and take a picture.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And it turns out that it's tribes --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
not money, not factories --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that can change our world, that can change politics,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that can align large numbers of people.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Not because you force them to do something against their will,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but because they wanted to connect.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
That what we do for a living now,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
all of us, I think,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is find something worth changing,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that spread the idea and spread the idea.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
it becomes a movement.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So when Al Gore set out

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to change the world again,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
he didn't do it by himself.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
He did it by creating a movement.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Thousands of people around the country

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
who could give his presentation for him,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
You don't need everyone.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I don't know, a thousand true fans --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
a thousand people who care enough

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that they will get you the next round

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and the next round and the next round.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And that means that the idea you create, the product you create,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the movement you create isn't for everyone,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
What it's about instead

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is finding the true believers.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's easy to look at what I've said so far,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
They're about the same age. But that's about it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What they did, though, is each in their own way,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
created a different way

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of navigating your way through technology.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So some people will go out and get people to be on one team.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And some people will get people to be on the other team.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It also informs the decisions you make

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
when you make products or services.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You know, this is one of my favorite devices.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But what a shame that it's not organized

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to help authors create movements.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
you could see the comments and quotes and notes

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Or from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
What would happen if authors, or people with ideas

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
could use version two, which comes out on Monday,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and use it to organize people

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
who want to talk about something.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But let me just try a couple.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
The Beatles did not invent teenagers.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They merely decided to lead them.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
That most movements, most leadership that we're doing

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is about finding a group that's disconnected

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but already has a yearning --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
not persuading people to want something

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
they don't have yet.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,"

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
her video that spread all across the internet

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
about the way farm animals are treated,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But she helped organize people,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and helped turn it into a movement.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me."

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Derek Sivers invented CD Baby,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which allowed independent musicians

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to have place to take the mission

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What all these people have in common is that they are heretics.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That heretics look at the status quo and say,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I see what the status quo is; I don't like it."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
That instead of looking at all the little rules

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and following each one of them,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
somebody who's half asleep,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
following instructions,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
keeping their head down, fitting in --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Someone stands up and says, "This one is important.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We need to organize around it."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You just need a few people --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
(Laughter) --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
who will look at the rules,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
realize they make no sense,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and realize how much they want to be connected.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Zappos isn't a shoe store.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Zappos is the one, the only,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the best-there-ever-was

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
place for people who are into shoes to find each other,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to talk about their passion,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
to connect with people who care more

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It can be something as prosaic as shoes,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It's exactly the same behavior though.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
What it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
is to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
then together we can get something that we all want.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
She does it by telling a story

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to people who want to hear it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
By connecting a tribe of people

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
who are desperate to be connected to each other.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
By leading a movement and

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
making change.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And around and around and around it goes.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So three questions I'd offer you.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The first one is, who exactly

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
are you upsetting?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The second question is, who are you connecting?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
the connections that are being made, one to the other.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And the third one is, who are you leading?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Because focusing on that part of it --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
not the mechanics of what you're building,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
but the who, and the leading part -- is where change comes.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I gave exactly the same pair to someone

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It's a story of a product that tells a story.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and someone says, "What are those?"

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
on behalf of the people who got the shoes.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
fighting against juvenile diabetes.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
connecting them, challenging the status quo

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
because it's important to him.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
You don't need permission from people to lead them.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But in case you do, here it is:

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
they're waiting, we're waiting

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for you to show us where to go next.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
the status quo.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
They challenge what's currently there.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The second thing is, they build a culture.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
A secret language, a seven-second handshake,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a way of knowing that you're in or out.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
They connect people to one another.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Do you know what people want more than anything?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They want to be missed.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
They want to be missed the day they don't show up.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
They want to be missed when they're gone.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And tribe leaders can do that.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
but you don't need charisma to become a leader.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Being a leader gives you charisma.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
that's where charisma comes from -- from the leading.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Finally, they commit.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
They commit to the people who are there.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So I'd like you to do something for me.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
is: create a movement.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Applause)
