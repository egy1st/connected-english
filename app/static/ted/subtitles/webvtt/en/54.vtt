WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
I'm going to take you
on a journey very quickly.

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:05.127
To explain the wish, I'm going
to have to take you somewhere

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:07.980
where many people haven't been,
and that's around the world.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.113
When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr
and myself started an organization

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.777
to get architects and designers
involved in humanitarian work,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.444
not only about responding
to natural disasters,

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:20.222
but involved in systemic issues.

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:26.015
We believe that where the resources
and expertise are scarce,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.785
innovative, sustainable design can really
make a difference in people's lives.

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:37.019
So I started my life as an architect,
or training as an architect,

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:40.460
and I was always interested
in socially responsible design,

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:42.376
and how you can really make an impact.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.346
But when I went to architecture school,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.321
it seemed that I was
a black sheep in the family.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.012
Many architects seemed to think
that when you design,

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:53.817
you design a jewel, and it's a jewel
that you try and crave for;

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.778
whereas I felt that when you design,

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.457
you either improve
or you create a detriment

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:00.544
to the community
in which you're designing.

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:03.076
So you're not just doing
a building for the residents

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.679
or for the people who are going to use it,
but for the community as a whole.

00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:13.129
And in 1999, we started by responding
to the issue of the housing crisis

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.164
for returning refugees in Kosovo.

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:18.800
And I didn't know what I was doing --
like I said, mid-20s --

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:23.373
and I'm the Internet generation,
so we started a website.

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:26.886
We put a call out there,
and to my surprise, in a couple of months,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.244
we had hundreds of entries
from around the world.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:32.305
That led to a number
of prototypes being built

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.576
and really experimenting with some ideas.

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:37.403
Two years later we started doing a project

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:41.061
on developing mobile health clinics
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.636
responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:51.802
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries.

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:56.576
We also have designers
from around the world that participate.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.246
And we had an exhibit
of work that followed that.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.684
2004 was the tipping point for us.

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:04.729
We started responding to natural disasters

00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:07.374
and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.098
also following up on our work in Africa.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:11.970
Working within the United States --

00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:15.065
most people look at poverty
and they see the face of a foreigner.

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.163
But I live in Bozeman, Montana --

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.405
go up to the north plains
on the reservations,

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.854
or go down to Alabama
or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:25.910
and I could have shown you
places that have far worse conditions

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:28.240
than many developing countries
that I've been to.

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:31.752
So we got involved in and worked
in inner cities and elsewhere;

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.193
and also, I will go into
some more projects.

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:38.111
2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:42.888
I think we can pretty much assume
that 2005 was a horrific year

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.579
when it comes to natural disasters.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:46.093
And because of the Internet,

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:49.506
and because of connections
to blogs and so forth,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.982
within literally hours of the tsunami,
we were already raising funds,

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.065
getting involved, working
with people on the ground.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.788
We run from a couple of laptops,
and in the first couple of days,

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:03.575
I had 4,000 emails
from people needing help.

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:06.788
So we began to get involved
in projects there,

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.426
and I'll talk about some others.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.421
And then of course, this year
we've been responding to Katrina,

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.889
as well as following up
on our reconstruction work.

00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:15.624
So this is a brief overview.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.017
In 2004, I really couldn't manage
the number of people who wanted to help,

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.146
or the number of requests
that I was getting.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.701
It was all coming
into my laptop and cell phone.

00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:31.098
So we decided to embrace
an open-source model of business --

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:34.289
so that anyone, anywhere in the world,
could start a local chapter,

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:36.379
and they can get involved
in local problems.

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:38.814
Because I believe there
is no such thing as Utopia.

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:41.410
All problems are local.
All solutions are local.

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:46.068
So that means, you know,
somebody who's based in Mississippi

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:48.445
knows more about Mississippi than I do.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:54.576
So what happened is, we used Meetup
and all these other Internet tools,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.891
and we ended up having
40 chapters starting up,

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:01.706
thousands of architects in 104 countries.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.449
So the bullet point --
sorry, I never do a suit,

00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:08.868
so I knew that I was going
to take this off.

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.195
OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.

00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:15.226
This isn't just about nonprofit.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.424
What it showed me is that
there's a grassroots movement going on,

00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:21.022
of socially responsible designers
who really believe

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.958
that this world has got a lot smaller,
and that we have the opportunity --

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:27.138
not the responsibility,
but the opportunity --

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:29.475
to really get involved in making change.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:34.747
(Laughter)

00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:40.965
(Laughter)

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.788
I'm adding that to my time.

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:45.613
(Laughter)

00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:47.576
So what you don't know is,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.624
we've got these thousands of designers
working around the world,

00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:53.679
connected basically by a website,
and we have a staff of three.

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:58.918
The fact that nobody told us
we couldn't do it, we did it.

00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:01.290
And so there's something
to be said about naïveté.

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:03.211
So seven years later, we've developed

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:06.649
so that we've got advocacy,
instigation and implementation.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:10.318
We advocate for good design,
not only through student workshops

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:12.664
and lectures and public forums, op-eds;

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:14.909
we have a book on humanitarian work;

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:18.116
but also disaster mitigation
and dealing with public policy.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.354
We can talk about FEMA,
but that's another talk.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:25.396
Instigation, developing ideas
with communities and NGOs,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.248
doing open-source design competitions.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.780
Referring, matchmaking with communities.

00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:34.111
And then implementing -- actually
going out there and doing the work,

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:39.869
because when you invent,
it's never a reality until it's built.

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:43.079
So it's really important
that if we're designing

00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:45.777
and trying to create change,
we build that change.

00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:47.861
So here's a select number of projects.

00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:50.686
Kosovo.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.342
This is Kosovo in '99.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:56.557
We did an open design
competition, like I said.

00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:58.975
It led to a whole variety of ideas.

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.917
And this wasn't about emergency shelter,

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:04.463
but transitional shelter
that would last five to 10 years,

00:06:04.487 --> 00:06:08.496
that would be placed next to the land
the resident lived in,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.647
and that they would rebuild
their own home.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.349
This wasn't imposing
an architecture on a community;

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.495
this was giving them
the tools and the space

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:20.208
to allow them to rebuild and regrow
the way they want to.

00:06:21.287 --> 00:06:24.207
We had from the sublime
to the ridiculous, but they worked.

00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:28.831
This is an inflatable hemp house.
It was built; it works.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.515
This is a shipping container.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.340
Built and works.

00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:35.714
And a whole variety of ideas

00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:39.245
that not only dealt with
architectural building,

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:40.943
but also the issues of governance,

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.378
and the idea of creating communities
through complex networks.

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:46.224
So we've engaged not just designers,

00:06:46.248 --> 00:06:51.773
but also a whole variety
of technology-based professionals.

00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:55.404
Using rubble from destroyed homes
to create new homes.

00:06:55.428 --> 00:07:01.282
Using straw bale construction,
creating heat walls.

00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:03.902
And then something remarkable
happened in '99.

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:07.699
We went to Africa originally
to look at the housing issue.

00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:10.835
Within three days, we realized
the problem was not housing;

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:13.565
it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.823
And it wasn't doctors telling us this;

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:18.514
it was actual villagers
that we were staying with.

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.483
And so we came up with the bright idea

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:25.702
that instead of getting people to walk
10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:27.565
you get the doctors to the people.

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:30.457
And we started engaging
the medical community,

00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:33.584
and you know, we thought
we were real bright sparks --

00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:35.354
"We've come up with this great idea:

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:39.960
mobile health clinics, widely distributed
throughout sub-Saharan Africa."

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.793
And the medical community there said,

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:45.283
"We've said this for the last decade.

00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:48.385
We know this. We just don't know
how to show this."

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.653
So in a way, we had taken pre-existing
needs and shown solutions.

00:07:54.177 --> 00:07:58.134
And so again, we had a whole variety
of ideas that came in.

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.016
This one I personally love,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.341
because the idea is that architecture
is not just about solutions,

00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:06.044
but about raising awareness.

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:08.482
This is a kenaf clinic.

00:08:08.506 --> 00:08:11.576
You get seed and you grow it
in a plot of land,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.269
and it grows 14 feet in a month.

00:08:15.293 --> 00:08:18.445
And on the fourth week, the doctors
come and they mow out an area,

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:20.548
put a tensile structure on the top,

00:08:20.572 --> 00:08:23.244
and when the doctors
have finished treating

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:26.989
and seeing patients and villagers,

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:28.885
you cut down the clinic and you eat it.

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.576
It's an eat-your-own-clinic.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.954
So it's dealing with the fact
that if you have AIDS,

00:08:33.978 --> 00:08:35.922
you also need to have nutrition rates,

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:38.802
and the idea of nutrition is as important

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:40.660
as getting antiretrovirals out there.

00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:43.172
So you know, this is a serious solution.

00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:45.199
This one I love.

00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:48.048
The idea is it's not just a clinic,
it's a community center.

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:50.095
This looked at setting up trade routes

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:52.184
and economic engines within the community,

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.422
so it can be a self-sustaining project.

00:08:54.446 --> 00:08:56.763
Every one of these projects
is sustainable.

00:08:57.176 --> 00:09:00.480
That's not because
I'm a tree-hugging green person.

00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:02.828
It's because when you live
on four dollars a day,

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:05.875
you're living on survival
and you have to be sustainable.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:08.577
You have to know where
your energy is coming from,

00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:11.053
you have to know where
your resource is coming from,

00:09:11.077 --> 00:09:13.091
and you have to keep the maintenance down.

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.203
So this is about getting
an economic engine,

00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:17.520
and then at night,
it turns into a movie theater.

00:09:17.544 --> 00:09:22.671
So it's not an AIDS clinic.
It's a community center.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.195
So you can see ideas.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.576
And these ideas developed into prototypes,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.391
and they were eventually built.

00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:30.922
And currently, as of this year,

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:35.207
there are clinics rolling out
in Nigeria and Kenya.

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:40.539
From that, we also developed Siyathemba.

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:42.224
The community came to us and said,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.271
"The problem is that the girls
don't have education."

00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:46.645
And we're working in an area

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.898
where young women
between the ages of 16 and 24

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.198
have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.

00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:55.079
And that's not
because they're promiscuous,

00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:56.753
it's because there's no knowledge.

00:09:56.777 --> 00:09:59.776
And so we decided to look
at the idea of sports,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.642
and create a youth sports center

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:04.464
that doubled as an HIV/AIDS
outreach center,

00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:08.321
and the coaches of the girls' team
were also trained doctors.

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:15.156
So that there would be a very slow way
of developing confidence in health care.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.959
And we picked nine finalists,

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:21.792
and then those nine finalists were
distributed throughout the entire region,

00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:23.943
and then the community
picked their design.

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:25.895
They said, this is our design,

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.219
because it's not only
about engaging a community;

00:10:28.243 --> 00:10:29.937
it's about empowering a community,

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.183
and about getting them to be
a part of the rebuilding process.

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:37.020
So, the winning design is here.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.663
And then, of course,
we actually go and work

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:42.370
with the community and the clients.

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:43.592
So this is the designer.

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:46.569
He's out there working
with the first ever women's soccer team

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:49.490
in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.

00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:52.245
And they can tell it better.

00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:55.779
(A cappella singing
in a South African language)

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:16.490
Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.

00:11:16.514 --> 00:11:19.460
I work at the Africa Centre,
I'm an IT user consultant.

00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:23.968
I'm also the national football player
for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.

00:11:23.992 --> 00:11:30.727
And I also play in the Vodacom League,
for the team called Tembisa,

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:32.898
which has now changed to Siyathemba.

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.358
This is our home ground.

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:40.451
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that
later because I'm running out of time.

00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:42.796
I can see Chris looking at me slyly.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.757
This was a connection,
just a meeting with somebody

00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:50.529
who wanted to develop Africa's first
telemedicine center, in Tanzania.

00:11:50.553 --> 00:11:52.791
And we met, literally,
a couple of months ago.

00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:54.402
We've already developed a design.

00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:56.633
The team is over there,
working in partnership.

00:11:56.657 --> 00:11:59.941
This was a matchmaking,
thanks to a couple of TEDsters --

00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:03.515
Sun [Microsystems],
Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:05.898
who connected me
with this amazing African woman.

00:12:05.922 --> 00:12:09.442
And we start construction in June,
and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.

00:12:09.466 --> 00:12:11.918
So when you come to TEDGlobal,
you can check it out.

00:12:12.537 --> 00:12:16.563
But what we're known probably most for
is dealing with disasters and development,

00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:18.626
and we've been involved
in a lot of issues,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:24.837
such as the tsunami
and also things like Hurricane Katrina.

00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:28.477
This is a 370-dollar shelter
that can be easily assembled.

00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:37.880
This is a community-designed
community center.

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:41.800
And what that means is we actually
live and work with the community,

00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:43.947
and they're part of the design process.

00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:48.834
The kids actually get
involved in mapping out

00:12:48.858 --> 00:12:51.524
where the community center should be.

00:12:51.932 --> 00:12:55.399
And then eventually, the community,
through skills training,

00:12:55.423 --> 00:12:57.540
end up building the building with us.

00:12:57.984 --> 00:12:59.707
Here is another school.

00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:04.711
This is what the UN gave these guys
for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:06.391
This was in August.

00:13:06.415 --> 00:13:09.439
This was the replacement;
that's supposed to last for two years.

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:11.765
When the rain comes down,
you can't hear a thing,

00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:14.103
and in the summer,
it's about 140 degrees inside.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.576
So we said, if the rain's coming
down, let's get fresh water.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.630
So every one of our schools
has a rainwater collection system.

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:27.156
Very low cost: three classrooms
and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.422
This was raised by hot chocolate
sales in Atlanta.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.236
It's built by the parents of the kids.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.887
The kids are out there on-site,
building the buildings.

00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.672
And it opened a couple of weeks ago,

00:13:38.696 --> 00:13:41.275
and there's 600 kids
that are now using the schools.

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:48.103
(Applause)

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:50.169
So, disaster hits home.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.819
We see the bad stories
on CNN and Fox and all that,

00:13:55.843 --> 00:13:57.627
but we don't see the good stories.

00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:01.770
Here is a community that got together,
and they said "no" to waiting.

00:14:01.794 --> 00:14:05.040
They formed a partnership,
a diverse partnership of players,

00:14:05.064 --> 00:14:07.175
to actually map out East Biloxi,

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.063
to figure out who's getting involved.

00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:13.008
We've had over 1,500 volunteers
rebuilding, rehabbing homes.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.785
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,

00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:19.634
not waiting for them to dictate
to us how you should rebuild.

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:20.897
Working with residents,

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:24.336
getting them out of their homes,
so they don't get ill.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.504
This is what they're
cleaning up on their own.

00:14:27.983 --> 00:14:29.136
Designing housing.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.277
This house is going in
in a couple of weeks.

00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:33.322
This is a rehabbed home,
done in four days.

00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:38.576
This is a utility room
for a woman who is on a walker.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.812
She's 70 years old.
This is what FEMA gave her.

00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:44.639
600 bucks, happened two days ago.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.856
We put together, very quickly, a washroom.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.873
It's built, it's running and she just
started a business today,

00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:52.920
where she's washing
other people's clothes.

00:14:52.944 --> 00:14:56.576
These are the Calhouns.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.592
They're photographers who had documented
the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:03.866
That was their home,
and these are the photographs they took.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.953
And we're helping, working with them
to create a new building.

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:08.731
Projects we've done.

00:15:09.183 --> 00:15:11.433
Projects we've been a part of, support.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.983
Why don't aid agencies do this?

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:17.049
This is the UN tent.

00:15:18.406 --> 00:15:21.327
This is the new UN tent,
just introduced this year.

00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:22.830
Quick to assemble.

00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:25.130
It's got a flap -- that's the invention.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:30.820
It took 20 years to design this
and get it implemented in the field.

00:15:30.844 --> 00:15:32.602
I was 12 years old.

00:15:33.768 --> 00:15:35.276
There's a problem here.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:38.085
Luckily, we're not alone.

00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:41.576
There are hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.576
and hundreds of architects
and designers and inventors

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.060
around the world that are getting
involved in humanitarian work.

00:15:51.234 --> 00:15:54.274
More hemp houses -- it's a theme
in Japan, apparently.

00:15:54.298 --> 00:15:55.933
I'm not sure what they're smoking.

00:15:55.957 --> 00:15:57.567
(Laughter)

00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:02.378
This is a Grip Clip,
designed by somebody who said,

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:05.409
"All you need is some way
to attach membrane structures

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:08.729
to physical support beams."

00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:15.718
This guy designed for NASA,
is now doing housing.

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:18.219
I'm going to whip through this quickly,

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:20.670
because I know I've got
only a couple of minutes.

00:16:22.165 --> 00:16:24.310
So this is all done in the last two years.

00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:26.961
I showed you something
that took 20 years to do.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.070
And this is just a selection of things

00:16:29.094 --> 00:16:31.749
that were built
in the last couple of years.

00:16:32.217 --> 00:16:33.999
From Brazil to India,

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:36.318
Mexico,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.573
Alabama,

00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:42.485
China,

00:16:43.825 --> 00:16:44.979
Israel,

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:46.153
Palestine,

00:16:46.823 --> 00:16:47.973
Vietnam.

00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:52.457
The average age of a designer
who gets involved in this project is 32 --

00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:53.752
that's how old I am.

00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:54.976
So it's a young --

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.597
I just have to stop here,
because Arup is in the room,

00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:01.978
and this is the best-designed
toilet in the world.

00:17:02.002 --> 00:17:05.049
If you're ever, ever in India,
go use this toilet.

00:17:05.073 --> 00:17:06.143
(Laughter)

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.135
Chris Luebkeman will tell you why.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.152
I'm sure that's how he wanted
to spend the party.

00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:19.858
But the future is not going to be
the sky-scraping cities of New York,

00:17:19.882 --> 00:17:21.033
but this.

00:17:21.057 --> 00:17:23.143
And when you look at this, you see crisis.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.834
What I see is many, many inventors.

00:17:26.469 --> 00:17:28.604
One billion people live in abject poverty.

00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:30.272
We hear about them all the time.

00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:33.481
Four billion live in growing
but fragile economies.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.438
One in seven live
in unplanned settlements.

00:17:37.462 --> 00:17:40.612
If we do nothing about the housing crisis
that's about to happen,

00:17:40.636 --> 00:17:44.191
in 20 years, one in three people
will live in an unplanned settlement

00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:45.478
or a refugee camp.

00:17:45.502 --> 00:17:48.215
Look left, look right:
one of you will be there.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.438
How do we improve the living standards
of five billion people?

00:17:52.866 --> 00:17:54.707
With 10 million solutions.

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.879
So I wish to develop a community

00:17:56.903 --> 00:18:00.476
that actively embraces
innovative and sustainable design

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.473
to improve the living
conditions for everyone.

00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:05.815
Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --
that's your wish?

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:06.990
CS: That's my wish.

00:18:07.014 --> 00:18:08.165
CA: That's his wish!

00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:14.712
(Applause)

00:18:21.303 --> 00:18:25.152
CS: We started Architecture for Humanity
with 700 dollars and a website.

00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:29.426
So Chris somehow decided
to give me 100,000.

00:18:29.783 --> 00:18:31.608
So why not this many people?

00:18:32.983 --> 00:18:35.428
Open-source architecture is the way to go.

00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:38.539
You have a diverse community
of participants --

00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:41.436
and we're not just talking
about inventors and designers,

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.579
but we're talking about the funding model.

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:45.381
My role is not as a designer;

00:18:45.405 --> 00:18:48.890
it's as a conduit between the design world
and the humanitarian world.

00:18:48.914 --> 00:18:53.668
And what we need is something
that replicates me globally,

00:18:53.692 --> 00:18:56.036
because I haven't slept in seven years.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.576
(Laughter)

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.429
Secondly, what will this thing be?

00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:05.333
Designers want to respond
to issues of humanitarian crisis,

00:19:05.357 --> 00:19:08.308
but they don't want
some company in the West

00:19:08.332 --> 00:19:10.983
taking their idea
and basically profiting from it.

00:19:11.007 --> 00:19:15.156
So Creative Commons has developed
the Developing Nations license.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.570
And what that means
is that a designer can --

00:19:17.594 --> 00:19:19.427
The Siyathemba project I showed

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:23.419
was the first ever building to have
a Creative Commons license on it.

00:19:23.443 --> 00:19:28.576
As soon as that is built, anyone
in Africa or any developing nation

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.793
can take the construction documents
and replicate it for free.

00:19:33.657 --> 00:19:38.209
(Applause)

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:41.152
So why not allow designers
the opportunity to do this,

00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:43.454
but still protect their rights here?

00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:47.483
We want to have a community
where you can upload ideas,

00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:51.707
and those ideas can be tested
in an earthquake, in flood,

00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:54.051
in all sorts of austere environments.

00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:55.812
The reason that's important

00:19:55.836 --> 00:19:57.893
is I don't want to wait
for the next Katrina

00:19:57.917 --> 00:19:59.526
to find out if my house works.

00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:03.148
That's too late, we need to do it now.

00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:04.506
So doing that globally --

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:10.020
and I want this whole thing
to work multi-lingually.

00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:14.127
When you look at the face of an architect,
most people think a gray-haired white guy.

00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:16.518
I don't see that;
I see the face of the world.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.950
So I want everyone
from all over the planet

00:20:18.974 --> 00:20:22.576
to be able to be a part
of this design and development.

00:20:22.942 --> 00:20:24.991
The idea of needs-based competitions --

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:28.416
XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,
if you want to call it that.

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:32.043
We also want to look
at ways of matchmaking

00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:34.184
and putting funding partners together,

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.550
and the idea of integrating
manufacturers --

00:20:36.574 --> 00:20:38.169
fab labs in every country.

00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:42.008
When I hear about the $100 laptop
and it's going to educate every child --

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:44.033
educate every designer in the world.

00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:48.567
Put one in every favela,
every slum settlement.

00:20:48.591 --> 00:20:50.829
Because you know what?
Innovation will happen.

00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:53.235
And I need to know that.
It's called the leap-back.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:55.389
We talk about leapfrog technologies.

00:20:55.413 --> 00:20:56.794
I write with Worldchanging,

00:20:56.818 --> 00:20:58.971
and the one thing
we've been talking about is,

00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:01.582
I learn more on the ground
than I've ever learned here.

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:04.758
So let's take those ideas,
adapt them, and we can use them.

00:21:07.428 --> 00:21:10.849
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:14.610
they should have
the potential for evolution;

00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:17.130
they should be developed
by every nation in the world

00:21:17.154 --> 00:21:19.250
and useful for every nation in the world.

00:21:19.837 --> 00:21:20.994
What will it take?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.604
There should be a sheet.

00:21:22.628 --> 00:21:26.136
I don't have time to read this,
because I'm going to be yanked off.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.430
CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.880
CS: Well, what will it take?
You guys are smart.

00:21:32.094 --> 00:21:34.958
So it's going to take a lot
of computing power,

00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:38.081
because I want the idea
that any laptop anywhere in the world

00:21:38.105 --> 00:21:39.476
can plug into the system

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.062
and be able to not only participate
in developing these designs,

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:44.841
but utilize the designs.

00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:48.622
Also, a process of reviewing the designs.

00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:52.058
I want every Arup engineer
in the world to check and make sure

00:21:52.082 --> 00:21:53.951
that we're doing stuff that's standing,

00:21:53.975 --> 00:21:56.116
because those guys
are the best in the world.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.290
Plug.

00:21:57.909 --> 00:22:01.466
And so, you know, I want these --

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.244
I just should note: I have two laptops
and one of them is there,

00:22:05.268 --> 00:22:07.751
and that has 3000 designs on it.

00:22:07.775 --> 00:22:10.728
If I drop that laptop ...

00:22:10.752 --> 00:22:12.202
What happens?

00:22:12.226 --> 00:22:15.194
So it's important to have
these proven ideas put up there,

00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:17.067
easy to use, easy to get ahold of.

00:22:21.044 --> 00:22:24.819
My mom once said, "There's nothing worse
than being all mouth and no trousers."

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:26.350
(Laughter)

00:22:26.374 --> 00:22:29.525
I'm fed up of talking about making change.

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:31.398
You only make it by doing it.

00:22:31.843 --> 00:22:35.423
We've changed FEMA guidelines;
we've changed public policy;

00:22:35.447 --> 00:22:39.861
we've changed international response --
based on building things.

00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:44.234
So for me, it's important that we create
a real conduit for innovation,

00:22:44.258 --> 00:22:45.902
and that it's free innovation.

00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:48.549
Think of free culture --
this is free innovation.

00:22:50.858 --> 00:22:53.646
Somebody said this a couple of years back.

00:22:55.138 --> 00:22:57.275
I will give points for those who know it.

00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:03.560
But I think the man was maybe
25 years too early.

00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:05.809
So let's do it.

00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:06.986
Thank you.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.992
(Applause)
