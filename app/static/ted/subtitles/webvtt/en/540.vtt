00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Applause)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
These Gapminder bubbles show you

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or how we estimate that it was.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What we are showing here is --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that shows how many are infected in each country,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the color is the continent.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, you can see United States, in 1983,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
had a very low percentage infected,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There were quite many people infected in the United States.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And, up there, you see Uganda.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They had almost five percent infected,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And they were probably the most infected country in the world.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, what has happened?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now you have understood the graph

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and now, in the next 60 seconds,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But first, I have a new invention here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
(Laughter)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Applause)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So, ready, steady, go!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
They went upwards like this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
they reached one to two percent.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then, Uganda started to turn back,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Look, India got many infected,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but had a low level.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And almost the same happens here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Russia went to one percent.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In the last two to three years,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
25 years it took.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's just that they have stopped getting worse.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And it has -- the steady state is, more or less,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It means 30 to 40 million people,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the whole of California -- every person,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that's more or less what we have today in the world.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
democratic government, good economy,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and this is what happened there.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They started low, they skyrocketed,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
they peaked up there in 2003,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and now they are down.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But they are falling only slowly,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they can manage to treat people.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
These percentages won't come down

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because people can survive 10 to 20 years.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So there's some problem with these metrics now.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because people still die.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
all people are not reached by treatment,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's not realistic with lifelong treatment

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for everyone in the poorest countries.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But it's very good that what is done is being done.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But focus now is back on prevention.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It is only by stopping the transmission

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that the world will be able to deal with it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but the drugs are very costly for the poor.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Not the drug in itself, but the treatment

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and the care which is needed around it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So, when we look at the pattern,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
one thing comes out very clearly:

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you see the blue bubbles

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and people say HIV is very high in Africa.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in African countries,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the same rate as United States.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And you'll find Madagascar,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and you'll find a lot of African countries

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
about as low as the rest of the world.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and things go on in one way in Africa.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We have to stop that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to think that way.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Applause)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
(Laughter)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So, why is it so high? Is it war?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
No, it's not. Look here.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they have two, three percent infected,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There are now studies clearly showing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, is it poverty?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Well if you look at the macro level,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it seems more money, more HIV.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But that's very simplistic,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so let's go down and look at Tanzania.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I will split Tanzania in five income groups,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
from the highest income to the lowest income,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and here we go.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
they have higher HIV.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and it is even bigger among women.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
done by African institutions and researchers

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Look here at Kenya.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I've split Kenya in its provinces.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Here it goes.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
See the difference within one African country --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
it goes from very low level to very high level,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, what is it then?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Well, it is more common with multiple partners,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
there is less condom use,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and there is age-disparate sex --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
in many of these highly affected countries.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But where are they situated?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I will swap the bubbles to a map.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
HIV exists all over the world.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Brazil has many HIV-infected.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
India has many because they are many.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Southeast Asia, and so on.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But, there is one part of Africa --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and the difficult thing is, at the same time,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
not to make a uniform statement about Africa,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
UNAIDS have done good data available, finally,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
about the spread of HIV.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
It could be concurrency.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It could be some virus types.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It could be that there is other things

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
behave tonight and so on.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But what we think is that it could be concurrency.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And what is concurrency?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We have serial monogamy.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And you collect a big number of exes.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is much more dangerous for HIV than others.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Probably, it's a combination of this.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
towards fact when we look at this.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You can get this chart, free.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
we will not only have the heart,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
we will not only have the money,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but we will also use the brain.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
(Applause)
