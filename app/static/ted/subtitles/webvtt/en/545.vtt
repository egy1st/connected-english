00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me talk about India

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
through the evolution of ideas.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because in every society, especially an open democratic society,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's only when ideas take root that things change.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Slowly ideas lead to ideology,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
lead to policies that lead to actions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And today, after the global economic crisis,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
there was a whole new set of rules

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
about how the state should intervene.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So ideas change states.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I looked at India and said,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
really there are four kinds of ideas

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which really make an impact on India.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The first, to my mind,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
These ideas have brought together something

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which has made India happen the way it is today.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Those are ideas which have been accepted

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but not implemented yet.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The third set of ideas are what I call as

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"ideas that we argue about" --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
those are ideas where we have a fight,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
an ideological battle about how to do things.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
"the ideas that we need to anticipate."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Because when you are a developing country

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you can actually anticipate

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
what that did and do things very differently.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
which are responsible for where it has come today.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The first is really the notion of people.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In the '60s and '70s

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we thought of people as a burden.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We thought of people as a liability.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Today we talk of people as an asset.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We talk of people as human capital.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And I believe this change in the mindset,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of looking at people as something of a burden

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to human capital,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And this change in thinking of human capital

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is linked to the fact

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that India is going through a demographic dividend.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
As healthcare improves,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
as infant mortality goes down,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
India is going to have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a lot of young people with a demographic dividend

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for the next 30 years.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What is unique about this demographic dividend

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is that India will be the only country in the world

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to have this demographic dividend.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And this is very important. At the same time

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
there are actually two demographic curves.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
One is in the south and in the west of India,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
almost equal to that of a West European country.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Then there is the whole northern India,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But a demographic dividend is only as good

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as the investment in your human capital.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Only if the people have education,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
they have good health, they have infrastructure,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
only in those cases can you really get the benefit

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of a demographic dividend.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the same demographic dividend

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
can be a demographic disaster.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Therefore India is at a critical point

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
where either it can leverage its demographic dividend

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or it can lead to a demographic disaster.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The second thing in India has been the change in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the role of entrepreneurs.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
entrepreneurs have become role models,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and they are contributing hugely to the society.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This change has contributed

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to the vitality and the whole economy.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The third big thing I believe that has changed India

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is our attitude towards the English language.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But today, with globalization,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And the fact that we have English is now becoming

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
a huge strategic asset.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The next thing is technology.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Forty years back, computers were seen

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
as something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
something that reduced jobs.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Today we live in a country

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which sells eight million mobile phones a month,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of which 90 percent of those mobile phones

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
are prepaid phones

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
because people don't have credit history.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Forty percent of those prepaid phones

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That is the scale at which

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
technology has liberated and made it accessible.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And therefore technology has gone

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
from being seen as something forbidding

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and intimidating to something that is empowering.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Twenty years back,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
when there was a report on bank computerization,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
they didn't name the report as

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
a report on computers,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
they call them as "ledger posting machines."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So we have come a long way from those days

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And then I think the other point

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
is that Indians today are far more

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
comfortable with globalization.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
under the East India Company and under imperial rule,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
believing it was a form of imperialism.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But today, as Indian companies go abroad,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
as Indians come and work all over the world,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Indians have gained a lot more confidence

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
because we are the only young country in an aging world,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And finally, India has had

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the deepening of its democracy.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
When democracy came to India 60 years back

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
it was an elite concept.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because they wanted to bring in the idea of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But today democracy has become a bottom-up process

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
where everybody has realized

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the benefits of having a voice,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
the benefits of being in an open society.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And therefore democracy has become embedded.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I believe these six factors --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the rise of the notion of population as human capital,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the rise of English as a language of aspiration,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
technology as something empowering,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
globalization as a positive factor,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to why India is today growing

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
at rates it has never seen before.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But having said that,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but you are not able to implement those things.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And really there are four things here.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
One is the question of education.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
primary education was never given the focus it required.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But now I believe it's reached a point

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
where it has become very important.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Unfortunately the government schools don't function,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
so children are going to private schools today.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Even in the slums of India

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But having said that, there is an enormous desire

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So I believe primary education is an idea

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
which is arrived but not yet implemented.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Similarly, infrastructure --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It's certainly not like China.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It is reflected in the political statements.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
which means "Electricity, water and roads."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And that is a change in the mindset

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
where infrastructure is now accepted.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but simply not implemented.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The third thing is again cities.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's because Gandhi believed in villages

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and because the British ruled from the cities,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
For a long time we have neglected our cities.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But today, finally, after economic reforms,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and economic growth,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I think the notion that cities are engines

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
of economic growth,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
cities are engines of creativity,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
cities are engines of innovation,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
have finally been accepted.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
because when you didn't think of India as a market,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And therefore you had a situation

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
where every state had its own market for products.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Every province had its own market for agriculture.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Increasingly now the policies of

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
taxation and infrastructure and all that,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
are moving towards creating India as a single market.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which is as important as external globalization.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
These four factors I believe --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the ones of primary education,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
in my view are ideas in India

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which have been accepted, but not implemented.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
The ideas that we argue about.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and because of the fact that there have been many people

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
who have been left out in the cold,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that we'll address that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And it leads to reservations and other techniques.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and all the left and right arguments that we have.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
of caste and other things.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
This policy is causing gridlock.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The second one is the labor policies that we have,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
which make it so difficult for

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that 93 percent of Indian labor

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is in the unorganized sector.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
They have no benefits: they don't have social security;

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
into the formal workforce,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
which are not as onerous as they are today.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The third thing is our higher education.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Indian higher education is completely regulated.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's very difficult to start a private university.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
As a result of that our higher education

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But most important I believe

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
are the ideas we need to anticipate.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Here India can look at what is happening in the west

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The first thing is, we're very fortunate

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that technology is at a point

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
where it is much more advanced

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
than when other countries had the development.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So we can use technology for governance.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
We can use technology for direct benefits.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The second thing is, the health issue.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
India has equally horrible

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
with a set of rich country diseases.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
We really need to put in place a strategy

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
so that we don't go to the other extreme of health.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Similarly today in the West

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
you're seeing the problem of entitlement --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Therefore when you are a young country,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And then again, India does not have the luxury

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
of making its environment dirty,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
because it has to marry environment and development.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilize

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
at something like 20 gigatons per year.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
On a population of nine billion

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
India is already at two tons per year.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But if India grows at something like eight percent,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the way we look at energy,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the way we create whole new paradigms of development.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now why does this matter to you?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Number one, this matters because

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
this represents more than a billion people.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It matters because this is a democracy.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And it is important to prove

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that growth and democracy are not incompatible,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and you can have growth.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's important because if you solve these problems,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's important because

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
you need it to solve the world's environment problems.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
If we really want to come to a point,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we want to really lower the use of energy --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
it has to be solved in countries like India.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
You know if you look at the development

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in the West over 200 years,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the average growth may have been about two percent.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And that makes a huge difference.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and the population was growing at two percent,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
When the economic growth goes to eight percent

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
then per capita income is doubling every nine years.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
of a billion people going to prosperity.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And you must have a clear strategy

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
which is important for India and important for the world.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
That is why I think all of you

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
should be equally concerned with it as I am.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Thank you very much.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
(Applause)
