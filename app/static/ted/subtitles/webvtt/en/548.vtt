00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:02.976
I'll tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.881
Not yours, of course -- other people's.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.087
(Laughter)

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:09.976
So after being at MIT for a few years,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.657
I realized that writing academic papers
is not that exciting.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.039
You know, I don't know
how many of those you read,

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:19.598
but it's not fun to read
and often not fun to write --

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:20.976
even worse to write.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.976
So I decided to try and write
something more fun.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.447
And I came up with an idea
that I would write a cookbook.

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:30.963
And the title for my cookbook
was going to be,

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:33.847
"Dining Without Crumbs:
The Art of Eating Over the Sink."

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.593
(Laughter)

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:38.522
And it was going to be a look
at life through the kitchen.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.101
I was quite excited about this.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.394
I was going to talk
a little bit about research,

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:43.915
a little bit about the kitchen.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:47.058
We do so much in the kitchen,
I thought this would be interesting.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:50.974
I wrote a couple of chapters,
and took it to MIT Press and they said,

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:54.092
"Cute, but not for us.
Go and find somebody else."

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.997
I tried other people,
and everybody said the same thing,

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.092
"Cute. Not for us."

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.976
Until somebody said,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.826
"Look, if you're serious about this,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.381
you have to write about your research
first; you have to publish something,

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:10.103
then you'll get the opportunity
to write something else.

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:12.398
If you really want to do it,
you have to do it."

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.767
I said, "I don't want to write
about my research.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.008
I do it all day long,

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:19.524
I want to write something
a bit more free, less constrained."

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.976
And this person
was very forceful and said,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.576
"Look, that's the only way
you'll ever do it."

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.910
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --"

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.093
I had a sabbatical.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:31.076
I said, "I'll write about my research,
if there's no other way.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.902
And then I'll get to do my cookbook."

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.162
So, I wrote a book on my research.

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:38.757
And it turned out to be
quite fun in two ways.

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.305
First of all, I enjoyed writing.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.083
But the more interesting thing
was that I started learning from people.

00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.692
It's a fantastic time to write,

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:49.421
because there's so much feedback
you can get from people.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:51.976
People write to me
about their personal experience,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.334
and about their examples,
and where they disagree,

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:55.976
and their nuances.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.286
And even being here --
I mean, the last few days,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.976
I've known heights of obsessive behavior

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
I never thought about.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.632
(Laughter)

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.548
Which I think is just fascinating.

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:09.167
I will tell you a little bit
about irrational behavior,

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.369
and I want to start by giving you
some examples of visual illusion

00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.326
as a metaphor for rationality.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.168
So think about these two tables.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:17.976
And you must have seen this illusion.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.821
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical
line on the table on the left,

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.638
or the horizontal line
on the table on the right,

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:26.976
which one seems longer?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.975
Can anybody see anything
but the left one being longer?

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.846
No, right? It's impossible.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.762
But the nice thing about visual illusion
is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.249
So I can put some lines
on; it doesn't help.

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:39.975
I can animate the lines.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.667
And to the extent you believe
I didn't shrink the lines,

00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.479
which I didn't, I've proven to you
that your eyes were deceiving you.

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:50.976
Now, the interesting thing about this
is when I take the lines away,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.810
it's as if you haven't learned
anything in the last minute.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.054
(Laughter)

00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:59.769
You can't look at this and say,
"Now I see reality as it is."

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:03.833
Right? It's impossible to overcome
this sense that this is indeed longer.

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:05.484
Our intuition is really fooling us

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:07.655
in a repeatable,
predictable, consistent way.

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.976
and there is almost nothing
we can do about it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.976
aside from taking a ruler
and starting to measure it.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.174
Here's another one.
It's one of my favorite illusions.

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.887
What color is the top arrow pointing to?

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.131
Audience: Brown.
Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:24.124
The bottom one? Yellow.

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:25.489
Turns out they're identical.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:27.424
Can anybody see them as identical?

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:28.822
Very, very hard.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.976
I can cover the rest of the cube up.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.406
If I cover the rest of the cube,
you can see that they are identical.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.867
If you don't believe me,
you can get the slide later

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:39.707
and do some arts and crafts
and see that they're identical.

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.064
But again, it's the same story,
that if we take the background away,

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:45.293
the illusion comes back.

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.294
There is no way for us not
to see this illusion.

00:03:48.318 --> 00:03:51.635
I guess maybe if you're colorblind,
I don't think you can see that.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.976
I want you to think
about illusion as a metaphor.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.135
Vision is one of the best things we do.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.755
We have a huge part of our brain
dedicated to vision --

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.674
bigger than dedicated to anything else.

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.546
We use our vision more hours
of the day than anything else.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.640
We're evolutionarily
designed to use vision.

00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:09.640
And if we have these predictable
repeatable mistakes in vision,

00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:11.170
which we're so good at,

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.758
what are the chances we won't make
even more mistakes

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:17.333
in something we're not as good at,
for example, financial decision-making.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.976
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.650
Something we don't have
an evolutionary reason to do,

00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:24.024
we don't have a specialized
part of the brain for,

00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:26.063
and we don't do that many
hours of the day.

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:28.055
The argument is in those cases,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.976
it might be that we actually
make many more mistakes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.773
And worse -- not having
an easy way to see them,

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:38.026
because in visual illusions, we can
easily demonstrate the mistakes;

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.137
in cognitive illusion
it's much, much harder

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:41.976
to demonstrate the mistakes to people.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.976
So I want to show you
some cognitive illusions,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.082
or decision-making illusions,
in the same way.

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:51.582
And this is one of my favorite
plots in social sciences.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:55.444
It's from a paper
by Johnson and Goldstein.

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:59.166
It basically shows the percentage
of people who indicated

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.920
they would be interested
in donating their organs.

00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:04.869
These are different countries in Europe.

00:05:04.893 --> 00:05:06.854
You basically see two types of countries:

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:09.480
countries on the right,
that seem to be giving a lot;

00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:12.463
and countries on the left
that seem to giving very little,

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:14.090
or much less.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.266
The question is, why?

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.614
Why do some countries give a lot
and some countries give a little?

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.266
When you ask people this question,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.822
they usually think that it has
to be about culture.

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:24.472
How much do you care about people?

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:25.976
Giving organs to somebody else

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.334
is probably about how much you care
about society, how linked you are.

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:30.976
Or maybe it's about religion.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.955
But if you look at this plot,

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.406
you can see that countries
that we think about as very similar,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.572
actually exhibit very different behavior.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.469
For example, Sweden
is all the way on the right,

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:44.152
and Denmark, which we think
is culturally very similar,

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.976
is all the way on the left.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.976
Germany is on the left,
and Austria is on the right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.316
The Netherlands is on the left,
and Belgium is on the right.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.976
And finally, depending
on your particular version

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
of European similarity,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.166
you can think about the U.K. and France
as either similar culturally or not,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.014
but it turns out that with organ
donation, they are very different.

00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:09.477
By the way, the Netherlands
is an interesting story.

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:13.120
You see, the Netherlands is kind
of the biggest of the small group.

00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:16.976
It turns out that they got to 28 percent

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.279
after mailing every household
in the country a letter,

00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:22.976
begging people to join
this organ donation program.

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:26.480
You know the expression,
"Begging only gets you so far."

00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:28.976
It's 28 percent in organ donation.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.869
(Laughter)

00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:33.623
But whatever the countries
on the right are doing,

00:06:33.647 --> 00:06:35.758
they're doing a much
better job than begging.

00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:37.090
So what are they doing?

00:06:37.114 --> 00:06:40.582
Turns out the secret has to do
with a form at the DMV.

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:41.976
And here is the story.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.507
The countries on the left
have a form at the DMV

00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:46.222
that looks something like this.

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:50.531
"Check the box below if you want to
participate in the organ donor program."

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:51.976
And what happens?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.309
People don't check, and they don't join.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.502
The countries on the right,
the ones that give a lot,

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:59.128
have a slightly different form.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:02.652
It says, "Check the box below
if you don't want to participate ..."

00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:04.866
Interestingly enough,
when people get this,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.976
they again don't check, but now they join.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.976
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.912
Now, think about what this means.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.976
You know, we wake up in the morning
and we feel we make decisions.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.310
We wake up in the morning
and we open the closet;

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.118
we feel that we decide what to wear.

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:24.214
we open the refrigerator and we feel
that we decide what to eat.

00:07:24.238 --> 00:07:25.737
What this is actually saying,

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.571
is that many of these decisions
are not residing within us.

00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.372
They are residing in the person
who is designing that form.

00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:33.667
When you walk into the DMV,

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:36.690
the person who designed the form
will have a huge influence

00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:38.523
on what you'll end up doing.

00:07:38.547 --> 00:07:41.326
Now, it's also very hard
to intuit these results.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.691
Think about it for yourself.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:43.976
How many of you believe

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.286
that if you went to renew
your license tomorrow,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.976
and you went to the DMV,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.267
and you encountered one of these forms,

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.752
that it would actually
change your own behavior?

00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:55.083
Very hard to think
that it would influence us.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:58.646
We can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans,
of course it would influence them."

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.433
But when it comes to us,

00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:03.095
we have such a feeling
that we're in the driver's seat,

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:06.408
such a feeling that we're in control
and we are making the decision,

00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:09.031
that it's very hard
to even accept the idea

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.730
that we actually have an illusion
of making a decision,

00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:13.818
rather than an actual decision.

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:16.310
Now, you might say,

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:18.751
"These are decisions we don't care about."

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:21.048
In fact, by definition,
these are decisions

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:23.655
about something that will happen
to us after we die.

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:25.799
How could we care about something less

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:28.112
than about something
that happens after we die?

00:08:28.136 --> 00:08:31.058
So a standard economist,
somebody who believes in rationality,

00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:32.335
would say, "You know what?

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:35.811
The cost of lifting the pencil
and marking a "V" is higher

00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:37.976
than the possible benefit of the decision,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.798
so that's why we get this effect."

00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:40.831
(Laughter)

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:43.353
But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:46.393
It's not because it's trivial.
It's not because we don't care.

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.838
It's the opposite. It's because we care.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.806
It's difficult and it's complex.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.381
And it's so complex
that we don't know what to do.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:55.381
And because we have no idea what to do,

00:08:55.405 --> 00:08:58.976
we just pick whatever it was
that was chosen for us.

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:01.150
I'll give you one more example.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:03.761
This is from a paper
by Redelmeier and Shafir.

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.291
And they said, "Would this
effect also happens to experts?

00:09:07.315 --> 00:09:10.443
People who are well-paid,
experts in their decisions,

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.823
and who make a lot of them?"

00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:14.032
And they took a group of physicians.

00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:16.508
They presented to them
a case study of a patient.

00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:19.976
They said, "Here is a patient.
He is a 67-year-old farmer.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.730
He's been suffering from
right hip pain for a while."

00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.588
And then, they said to the physicians,

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:25.976
"You decided a few weeks ago

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.976
that nothing is working for this patient.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.429
All these medications,
nothing seems to be working.

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.225
So you refer the patient
for hip replacement therapy.

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:34.976
Hip replacement. Okay?"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.975
So the patient is on a path
to have his hip replaced.

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:40.425
Then they said to half of the physicians,

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.788
"Yesterday, you reviewed
the patient's case,

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:45.422
and you realized that you forgot
to try one medication.

00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:47.042
You did not try ibuprofen.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.325
What do you do? Do you pull
the patient back and try ibuprofen?

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.119
Or do you let him go
and have hip replacement?"

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:56.794
Well, the good news is
that most physicians in this case

00:09:56.818 --> 00:09:59.627
decided to pull the patient
and try ibuprofen.

00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:01.391
Very good for the physicians.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:03.482
To the other group
of physicians, they said,

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:07.355
"Yesterday when you reviewed the case,
you discovered there were two medications

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:09.895
you didn't try out yet --
ibuprofen and piroxicam."

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:12.170
You have two medications
you didn't try out yet.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:14.837
What do you do? You let him go,
or you pull him back?

00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:18.305
And if you pull him back, do you try
ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:19.485
Now, think of it:

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.381
This decision makes it as easy to let
the patient continue with hip replacement,

00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:26.531
but pulling him back, all of the sudden
it becomes more complex.

00:10:26.555 --> 00:10:28.373
There is one more decision.

00:10:28.397 --> 00:10:29.723
What happens now?

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:33.366
The majority of the physicians
now choose to let the patient go

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.907
for a hip replacement.

00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:36.976
I hope this worries you, by the way --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.233
(Laughter)

00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:39.976
when you go to see your physician.

00:10:40.622 --> 00:10:43.344
The thing is that
no physician would ever say,

00:10:43.368 --> 00:10:47.161
"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.
Let's go for hip replacement."

00:10:47.185 --> 00:10:49.976
But the moment you set this
as the default,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.976
it has a huge power over whatever
people end up doing.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.334
I'll give you a couple of more examples
on irrational decision-making.

00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:59.176
Imagine I give you a choice:

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.813
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome,
all expenses paid --

00:11:02.837 --> 00:11:07.399
hotel, transportation, food,
a continental breakfast, everything --

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:08.976
or a weekend in Paris?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.254
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend
in Rome -- these are different things.

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:15.056
They have different food,
different culture, different art.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.436
Imagine I added a choice to the set
that nobody wanted.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.212
Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:21.604
a weekend in Paris,

00:11:21.628 --> 00:11:23.220
or having your car stolen?"

00:11:23.244 --> 00:11:26.277
(Laughter)

00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:29.547
It's a funny idea, because why
would having your car stolen,

00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:31.167
in this set, influence anything?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.305
(Laughter)

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:37.778
But what if the option to have your car
stolen was not exactly like this?

00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:40.334
What if it was a trip to Rome,
all expenses paid,

00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:42.636
transportation, breakfast,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.976
but it doesn't include
coffee in the morning?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.373
If you want coffee, you have to pay
for it yourself, it's two euros 50.

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:49.404
(Laughter)

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:50.976
Now in some ways,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.299
given that you can have Rome with coffee,

00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:55.704
why would you possibly
want Rome without coffee?

00:11:55.728 --> 00:11:58.672
It's like having your car stolen.
It's an inferior option.

00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:00.466
But guess what happened?

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.801
The moment you add Rome without coffee,

00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:06.443
Rome with coffee becomes more popular,
and people choose it.

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:08.976
The fact that you have Rome without coffee

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.976
makes Rome with coffee look superior,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.976
and not just to Rome without coffee --
even superior to Paris.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.077
(Laughter)

00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:20.553
Here are two examples of this principle.

00:12:20.577 --> 00:12:23.229
This was an ad in The Economist
a few years ago

00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:25.333
that gave us three choices:

00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:28.190
an online subscription for 59 dollars,

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.699
a print subscription for 125 dollars,

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:33.976
or you could get both for 125.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.976
(Laughter)

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.585
Now I looked at this,
and I called up The Economist,

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:41.172
and I tried to figure out
what they were thinking.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.338
And they passed me from one person
to another to another,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:48.085
until eventually I got to the person
who was in charge of the website,

00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:51.704
and I called them up, and they went
to check what was going on.

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:55.575
The next thing I know,
the ad is gone, no explanation.

00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:57.486
So I decided to do the experiment

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.152
that I would have loved
The Economist to do with me.

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:02.575
I took this and I gave it
to 100 MIT students.

00:13:02.599 --> 00:13:04.163
I said, "What would you choose?"

00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:08.173
These are the market shares --
most people wanted the combo deal.

00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:10.405
Thankfully, nobody wanted
the dominant option.

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:12.069
That means our students can read.

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:13.475
(Laughter)

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:16.388
But now, if you have an option
that nobody wants,

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.111
you can take it off, right?

00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:19.976
So I printed another version of this,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.817
where I eliminated the middle option.

00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:25.324
I gave it to another 100 students.
Here is what happened:

00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:28.085
Now the most popular option
became the least popular,

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:30.752
and the least popular
became the most popular.

00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:34.976
What was happening
was the option that was useless,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.851
in the middle, was useless
in the sense that nobody wanted it.

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:42.041
But it wasn't useless in the sense
that it helped people figure out

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:43.216
what they wanted.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.976
In fact, relative
to the option in the middle,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.499
which was get only the print for 125,

00:13:50.523 --> 00:13:54.276
the print and web for 125
looked like a fantastic deal.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.403
And as a consequence, people chose it.

00:13:56.427 --> 00:13:58.054
The general idea here, by the way,

00:13:58.078 --> 00:14:00.769
is that we actually don't know
our preferences that well.

00:14:00.793 --> 00:14:03.263
And because we don't know
our preferences that well,

00:14:03.287 --> 00:14:06.576
we're susceptible to all of these
influences from the external forces:

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.276
the defaults, the particular options
that are presented to us, and so on.

00:14:10.632 --> 00:14:11.976
One more example of this.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.357
People believe that when we deal
with physical attraction,

00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:18.644
we see somebody, and we know immediately
whether we like them or not,

00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:19.976
if we're attracted or not.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.432
This is why we have
these four-minute dates.

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:24.976
So I decided to do
this experiment with people.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.976
I'll show you images here, no real people,
but the experiment was with people.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.976
I showed some people a picture
of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.069
and I said, "Who do you want to date?

00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:35.568
Tom or Jerry?"

00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:38.871
But for half the people,
I added an ugly version of Jerry.

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:43.976
I took Photoshop and I made
Jerry slightly less attractive.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.413
(Laughter)

00:14:45.437 --> 00:14:48.976
For the other people, I added
an ugly version of Tom.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.976
And the question was,
will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.768
help their respective,
more attractive brothers?

00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:58.021
The answer was absolutely yes.

00:14:58.045 --> 00:15:00.191
When ugly Jerry was around,
Jerry was popular.

00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:02.355
When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:03.976
(Laughter)

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.512
This of course has two
very clear implications

00:15:06.536 --> 00:15:08.845
for life in general.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.976
If you ever go bar-hopping,
who do you want to take with you?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.729
(Laughter)

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:22.530
You want a slightly uglier
version of yourself.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:23.976
(Laughter)

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.237
Similar, but slightly uglier.

00:15:26.261 --> 00:15:27.704
(Laughter)

00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:31.497
The second point, or course, is that
if somebody invites you to bar hop,

00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:33.268
you know what they think about you.

00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:35.976
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.282
Now you get it.

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:39.976
What is the general point?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.258
The general point is that,

00:15:41.282 --> 00:15:44.976
when we think about economics, we have
this beautiful view of human nature.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.537
"What a piece of work is a man!
How noble in reason!"

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:50.139
We have this view of ourselves, of others.

00:15:50.163 --> 00:15:55.377
The behavioral economics perspective
is slightly less "generous" to people;

00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:57.500
in fact, in medical terms,

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:58.716
that's our view.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.867
(Laughter)

00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:05.976
But there is a silver lining.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.874
The silver lining is, I think,

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:11.976
kind of the reason that behavioral
economics is interesting and exciting.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.865
Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?

00:16:15.286 --> 00:16:18.277
When it comes to building
the physical world,

00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:20.333
we kind of understand our limitations.

00:16:20.357 --> 00:16:21.528
We build steps.

00:16:21.552 --> 00:16:24.695
And we build these things
that not everybody can use, obviously.

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:26.615
(Laughter)

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.186
We understand our limitations,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.860
and we build around them.

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:32.463
But for some reason, when it comes
to the mental world,

00:16:32.487 --> 00:16:35.844
when we design things like healthcare
and retirement and stock markets,

00:16:35.868 --> 00:16:38.216
we somehow forget the idea
that we are limited.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.147
I think that if we understood
our cognitive limitations

00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:43.783
in the same way we understand
our physical limitations,

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:46.617
even though they don't stare us
in the face the same way,

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:49.121
we could design a better world,
and that, I think,

00:16:49.145 --> 00:16:50.538
is the hope of this thing.

00:16:50.562 --> 00:16:51.976
Thank you very much.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.642
