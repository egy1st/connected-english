WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.322
Alright.

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:07.976
I'm going to show you a couple of images

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.976
from a very diverting paper
in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.676
I'm going to go way out on a limb and say
that it is the most diverting paper

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.376
ever published in
The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.976
The title is "Observations
of In-Utero Masturbation."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.976
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.276
Okay. Now on the left you can see
the hand -- that's the big arrow --

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.522
and the penis on the right.
The hand hovering.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.506
And over here we have,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.976
in the words of radiologist
Israel Meisner,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.976
"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion
resembling masturbation movements."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.976
Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.976
so it would have been moving images.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.976
Orgasm is a reflex
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, this is the part
of the nervous system

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:57.976
that deals with the things
that we don't consciously control,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.999
like digestion, heart rate
and sexual arousal.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.765
And the orgasm reflex can be triggered
by a surprisingly broad range of input.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.976
Genital stimulation. Duh.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.091
who could be brought to orgasm
by having someone stroke her eyebrow.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.976
People with spinal cord injuries,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.976
like paraplegias, quadriplegias,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.976
will often develop a very,
very sensitive area

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.976
right above the level of their injury,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.976
wherever that is.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.976
There is such a thing
as a knee orgasm in the literature.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.976
I think the most curious one
that I came across

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.976
was a case report of a woman

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.976
who had an orgasm every time
she brushed her teeth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.976
(Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.976
Something in the complex
sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.976
was triggering orgasm.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
And she went to a neurologist,
who was fascinated.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
He checked to see
if it was something in the toothpaste,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
but no -- it happened with any brand.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.143
They stimulated her gums with a toothpick,
to see if that was doing it.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.976
No. It was the whole, you know, motion.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.976
And the amazing thing to me

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.976
is that you would think this woman
would have excellent oral hygiene.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.976
(Laughter)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.715
Sadly -- this is what it said
in the journal paper --

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.976
"She believed that she was
possessed by demons

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.976
and switched to mouthwash
for her oral care."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
It's so sad.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.077
(Laughter)

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.976
When I was working on the book,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.976
I interviewed a woman
who can think herself to orgasm.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.976
She was part of a study
at Rutgers University.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
You've got to love that. Rutgers.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.976
So I interviewed her in Oakland,
in a sushi restaurant.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.976
And I said, "So, could you
do it right here?"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.176
And she said,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.315
"Yeah, but you know I'd rather
finish my meal if you don't mind."

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.376
(Laughter)

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.976
But afterwards, she was kind enough
to demonstrate on a bench outside.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.096
It was remarkable.
It took about one minute.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.976
And I said to her,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.976
"Are you just doing this all the time?"

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.077
(Laughter)

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.976
She said, "No. Honestly, when I get home,
I'm usually too tired."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.976
(Laughter)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
She said that the last time
she had done it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.976
was on the Disneyland tram.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.976
(Laughter)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.976
The headquarters for orgasm,
along the spinal nerve,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.735
is something called the sacral nerve root,

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.976
which is back here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.976
And if you trigger,
if you stimulate with an electrode,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.976
the precise spot,
you will trigger an orgasm.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.976
And it is a fact that you can trigger
spinal reflexes in dead people --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
a certain kind of dead person,
a beating-heart cadaver.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.976
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.976
legally dead, definitely checked out,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
but is being kept alive on a respirator,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.976
so that their organs will be oxygenated
for transplantation.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.976
Now in one of these brain-dead people,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.976
if you trigger the right spot,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.976
you will see something every now and then.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.048
There is a reflex called
the Lazarus reflex.

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:17.976
And this is -- I'll demonstrate
as best I can, not being dead.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.976
It's like this. You trigger the spot.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.976
The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.976
Very unsettling for people
working in pathology labs.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.077
(Laughter)

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:33.976
Now, if you can trigger
the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.373
why not the orgasm reflex?

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:40.976
I asked this question
to a brain death expert,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.976
Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough
to return my emails.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.077
(Laughter)

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.976
I said, "So, could you conceivably
trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.667
She said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve
is being oxygenated,

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.976
you conceivably could."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.976
Obviously it wouldn't be
as much fun for the person.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.976
But it would be an orgasm --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.077
(Laughter)

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.422
nonetheless.

00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:08.667
There is a researcher
at the University of Alabama

00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:09.976
who does orgasm research.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.096
I said to her,
"You should do an experiment.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.976
You know? You can get cadavers
if you work at a university."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.976
I said, "You should actually do this."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.478
She said, "You get the human subjects
review board approval for this one."

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:22.365
(Laughter)

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.976
According to 1930s marriage manual author,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.976
Theodoor van De Velde,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.976
a slight seminal odor can be detected
on the breath of a woman

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.146
within about an hour
after sexual intercourse.

00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:38.976
Theodoor van De Velde was something
of a semen connoisseur.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.976
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.667
This is a guy writing a book,
"Ideal Marriage," you know.

00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.976
Very heavy hetero guy.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.143
But he wrote in this book,
"Ideal Marriage" --

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:51.976
he said that he could differentiate
between the semen of a young man,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.976
which he said had a fresh,
exhilarating smell,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.976
and the semen of mature men,
whose semen smelled, quote,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.976
"Remarkably like that of the flowers
of the Spanish chestnut.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.976
Sometimes quite freshly floral,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.048
and then again sometimes
extremely pungent."

00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:11.976
(Laughter)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.976
Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,
a man began hiccupping.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.976
And this was one of those cases
that went on and on.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He tried everything his friends suggested.

00:06:22.024 --> 00:06:23.976
Nothing seemed to help.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.422
Days went by.

00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:29.976
At a certain point, the man,
still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.976
And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.976
He told his doctor,
who published a case report

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.976
in a Canadian medical journal
under the title,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.976
"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential
Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.976
I love this article because
at a certain point they suggested

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.976
that unattached hiccuppers
could try masturbation.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.077
(Laughter)

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.976
I love that because there is like a whole
demographic: unattached hiccuppers.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.976
(Laughter)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.976
Married, single, unattached hiccupper.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.976
In the 1900s, early 1900s,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.976
a lot of gynecologists believed
that when a woman has an orgasm,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.976
the contractions serve to suck
the semen up through the cervix

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.286
and sort of deliver it
really quickly to the egg,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.976
thereby upping the odds of conception.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.976
It was called the "upsuck" theory.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.999
(Laughter)

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:30.976
If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.976
physicians believed that orgasm in women

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.976
was not just helpful
for conception, but necessary.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.976
Doctors back then
were routinely telling men

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.976
the importance of pleasuring their wives.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.976
Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer
Theodoor van De Velde --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.077
(Laughter)

00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:52.976
has a line in his book.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.064
I loved this guy.

00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:56.976
I got a lot of mileage
out of Theodoor van De Velde.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.976
He had this line in his book

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.976
that supposedly comes
from the Habsburg Monarchy,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.976
where there was an empress Maria Theresa,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.976
who was having trouble conceiving.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.976
And apparently the royal
court physician said to her,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
"I am of the opinion that the vulva
of your most sacred majesty

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:16.976
be titillated for some time
prior to intercourse."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.077
(Laughter)

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:21.976
It's apparently, I don't know,
on the record somewhere.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.838
Masters and Johnson:

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:25.976
now we're moving forward to the 1950s.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.976
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.976
which is also really fun to say.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.976
They didn't buy it.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.076
And they decided,
being Masters and Johnson,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.076
that they would get to the bottom of it.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.076
They brought women into the lab
-- I think it was five women --

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.976
and outfitted them with cervical caps
containing artificial semen.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.976
And in the artificial semen
was a radio-opaque substance,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.999
such that it would show up on an X-ray.

00:08:54.603 --> 00:08:55.976
This is the 1950s.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.976
Anyway, these women
sat in front of an X-ray device.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.976
And they masturbated.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.976
And Masters and Johnson looked to see
if the semen was being sucked up.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.976
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.976
You may be wondering,
"How do you make artificial semen?"

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.976
(Laughter)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.096
I have an answer for you.
I have two answers.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.976
You can use flour and water,
or cornstarch and water.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.976
I actually found three
separate recipes in the literature.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.077
(Laughter)

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:28.976
My favorite being the one that says --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.077
you know, they have
the ingredients listed,

00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:33.292
and then in a recipe
it will say, for example,

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:34.976
"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.976
This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.976
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.524
There's another way that orgasm
might boost fertility.

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:44.976
This one involves men.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.429
Sperm that sit around in the body
for a week or more

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.976
start to develop abnormalities

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.976
that make them less effective
at head-banging their way into the egg.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.440
British sexologist Roy Levin
has speculated

00:09:57.464 --> 00:09:58.999
that this is perhaps why men

00:09:59.023 --> 00:10:01.976
evolved to be such enthusiastic
and frequent masturbators.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.976
He said, "If I keep tossing myself off
I get fresh sperm being made."

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.976
Which I thought
was an interesting idea, theory.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.976
So now you have an evolutionary excuse.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.976
(Laughter)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.976
Okay.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.976
(Laughter)

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.976
All righty. There is considerable evidence
for upsuck in the animal kingdom --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.976
pigs, for instance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.976
In Denmark, the Danish National Committee
for Pig Production

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.953
found out that if you
sexually stimulate a sow

00:10:36.977 --> 00:10:38.831
while you artificially inseminate her,

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:41.676
you will see a six-percent increase
in the farrowing rate,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.976
which is the number of piglets produced.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.976
So they came up with this five-point
stimulation plan for the sows.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.976
There is posters they put in the barn,
and they have a DVD.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.976
And I got a copy of this DVD.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.077
(Laughter)

00:10:57.101 --> 00:11:00.976
This is my unveiling,
because I am going to show you a clip.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.976
(Laughter)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.626
So, okay.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.976
Now, here we go, la la la, off to work.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.976
It all looks very innocent.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.096
He's going to be doing things
with his hands

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.976
that the boar would use
his snout, lacking hands. Okay.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.976
(Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.600
This is it.

00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:24.976
The boar has a very odd
courtship repertoire.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.976
(Laughter)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.976
This is to mimic the weight of the boar.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.976
(Laughter)

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.976
You should know, the clitoris
of the pig is inside the vagina.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.275
So this may be
sort of titillating for her.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.338
Here we go.

00:11:40.362 --> 00:12:01.976
(Laughter)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.976
And the happy result.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.976
(Applause)

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.976
I love this video.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.600
There is a point in this video,
towards the beginning,

00:12:10.624 --> 00:12:13.862
where they zoom in for a close up
of his hand with his wedding ring,

00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:15.983
as if to say,
"It's okay, it's just his job.

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:17.376
He really does like women."

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.976
(Laughter)

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.456
Okay. When I was in Denmark,
my host was named Anne Marie.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.976
And I said, "So why don't you just
stimulate the clitoris of the pig?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.976
Why don't you have the farmers do that?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.976
That's not one of your five steps."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.023
I have to read you
what she said, because I love it.

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.476
She said, "It was a big hurdle

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.976
just to get farmers to touch
underneath the vulva.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.976
So we thought, let's not mention
the clitoris right now."

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.976
(Laughter)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.429
Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,
can purchase a -- this is true --

00:12:52.453 --> 00:12:53.976
a sow vibrator,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.339
that hangs on the sperm
feeder tube to vibrate.

00:12:56.363 --> 00:13:00.976
Because, as I mentioned,
the clitoris is inside the vagina.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.976
So possibly, you know,
a little more arousing than it looks.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.976
And I also said to her,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.477
"Now, these sows. I mean,
you may have noticed there.

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.076
The sow doesn't look to be
in the throes of ecstasy."

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.243
And she said, you can't make
that conclusion,

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:17.187
because animals don't register
pain or pleasure

00:13:17.211 --> 00:13:19.258
on their faces in the same way that we do.

00:13:19.282 --> 00:13:21.976
Pigs, for example, are more like dogs.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.096
They use the upper half of the face;
the ears are very expressive.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.976
So you're not really sure
what's going on with the pig.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.532
Primates, on the other hand,
we use our mouths more.

00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:35.976
This is the ejaculation face
of the stump-tailed macaque.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.976
(Laughter)

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.976
And, interestingly, this has been
observed in female macaques,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.976
but only when mounting another female.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.976
(Laughter)

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.263
Masters and Johnson.

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:53.474
In the 1950s, they decided,
okay, we're going to figure out

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:55.976
the entire human sexual response cycle,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.976
from arousal, all the way through orgasm,
in men and women --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
everything that happens in the human body.

00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:03.976
Okay, with women,
a lot of this is happening inside.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.976
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.976
They developed an artificial
coition machine.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.976
This is basically
a penis camera on a motor.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.976
There is a phallus,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.976
clear acrylic phallus,
with a camera and a light source,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.976
attached to a motor
that is kind of going like this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.976
And the woman would have sex with it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That is what they would do.
Pretty amazing.

00:14:27.024 --> 00:14:28.976
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.524
This just kills me,
not because I wanted to use it --

00:14:31.548 --> 00:14:33.976
I wanted to see it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.976
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.976
One fine day,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.882
Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate

00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:47.032
the average distance
traveled by ejaculated semen.

00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:49.976
This was not idle curiosity.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.976
Doctor Kinsey had heard --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.476
and there was a theory going around
at the time, this being the 1940s --

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.976
that the force with which
semen is thrown against the cervix

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.976
was a factor in fertility.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.976
Kinsey thought it was bunk,
so he got to work.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.976
He got together in his lab

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.976
300 men, a measuring tape,
and a movie camera.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.976
(Laughter)

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.976
And in fact, he found
that in three quarters of the men

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.976
the stuff just kind of slopped out.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.976
It wasn't spurted or thrown
or ejected under great force.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.976
However, the record holder

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.858
landed just shy of the eight-foot mark,
which is impressive.

00:15:34.882 --> 00:15:35.976
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.077
(Applause)

00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.976
Yes. Exactly.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.077
(Laughter)

00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:42.976
Sadly, he's anonymous.
His name is not mentioned.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.944
(Laughter)

00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:49.239
In his write-up
of this experiment in his book,

00:15:49.263 --> 00:15:51.976
Kinsey wrote,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.976
"Two sheets were laid down to protect
the oriental carpets."

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.976
(Laughter)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.976
Which is my second favorite line
in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.976
My favorite being, "Cheese crumbs
spread before a pair of copulating rats

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.341
will distract the female,
but not the male."

00:16:09.365 --> 00:16:10.976
(Laughter)

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.976
Thank you very much.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.976
(Applause)

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Thanks!
