WEBVTT

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.559
I can't help but this wish:

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:06.016
to think about when you're a little kid,
and all your friends ask you,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.628
"If a genie could give you
one wish in the world,

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:09.806
what would it be?"

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.572
And I always answered,

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:12.906
"Well, I'd want the wish

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.418
to have the wisdom to know
exactly what to wish for."

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.123
Well, then you'd be screwed,

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:21.162
because you'd know what to wish for,
and you'd use up your wish,

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:25.009
and now, since we only have one wish --
unlike last year they had three wishes --

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.519
I'm not going to wish for that.

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:31.546
So let's get to what I would like,
which is world peace.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.602
And I know what you're thinking:

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.590
You're thinking, "The poor girl up there,

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:37.391
she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.666
She's not. She's at the TED Prize."

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.276
(Laughter)

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:44.863
But I really do think it makes sense.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.839
And I think that
the first step to world peace

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.683
is for people to meet each other.

00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:52.195
I've met a lot of different
people over the years,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.621
and I've filmed some of them,

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:58.541
from a dotcom executive in New York
who wanted to take over the world,

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:00.976
to a military press officer in Qatar,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.505
who would rather not take over the world.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.214
If you've seen the film
"Control Room" that was sent out,

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:07.863
you'd understand a little bit why.

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:09.038
(Applause)

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.220
Thank you.

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:13.516
Wow! Some of you watched it.
That's great. That's great.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.110
So basically what I'd like
to talk about today

00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:20.976
is a way for people to travel,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.976
to meet people in a different way than --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.976
because you can't travel
all over the world at the same time.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.236
And a long time ago --
well, about 40 years ago --

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.786
my mom had an exchange student.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.715
And I'm going to show you
slides of the exchange student.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:40.890
This is Donna.

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:42.945
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:47.466
This is my mother and aunt
teaching Donna how to ride a bike.

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.451
This is Donna eating ice cream.

00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:55.597
And this is Donna teaching my aunt
how to do a Filipino dance.

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.099
I really think as the world
is getting smaller,

00:02:00.123 --> 00:02:01.766
it becomes more and more important

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.652
that we learn each other's dance moves,

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:06.082
that we meet each other,
we get to know each other,

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.745
we are able to figure out
a way to cross borders,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.893
to understand each other, to understand
people's hopes and dreams,

00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:14.373
what makes them laugh and cry.

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:17.418
And I know that we can't
all do exchange programs,

00:02:17.442 --> 00:02:19.267
and I can't force everybody to travel;

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.610
I've already talked about that
to Chris and Amy,

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:23.836
and they said that
there's a problem with this:

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.595
You can't force people, free will.

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.726
And I totally support that,
so we're not forcing people to travel.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.004
But I'd like to talk
about another way to travel

00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:33.976
that doesn't require
a ship or an airplane,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.976
and just requires a movie camera,
a projector and a screen.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.833
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:48.588
I was asked that I speak a little bit
about where I personally come from,

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:51.715
and Cameron, I don't know how
you managed to get out of that one,

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.976
but I think that building bridges
is important to me

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.147
because of where I come from.

00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.550
I'm the daughter of an American mother

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:04.685
and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.781
So I'm the living product
of two cultures coming together.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:09.957
No pun intended.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:10.988
(Laughter)

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:12.269
And I've also been called,

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:15.142
as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American
with a Persian name,

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.056
the "Middle East Peace Crisis."

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.556
So maybe me starting to take
pictures was some kind of way

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.032
to bring both sides
of my family together --

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:29.881
a way to take the worlds with me,
a way to tell stories visually.

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.049
It all kind of started that way,

00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:35.669
but I think that I really realized
the power of the image

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:38.905
when I first went
to the garbage-collecting village

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.929
in Egypt, when I was about 16.

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.500
My mother took me there.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.664
She's somebody who believes strongly
in community service,

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.331
and decided that this was something
that I needed to do.

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:52.976
And so I went there and I met
some amazing women there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.930
There was a center there,

00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:58.992
where they were teaching
people how to read and write,

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:01.230
and get vaccinations
against the many diseases

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:03.349
you can get from sorting through garbage.

00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:04.938
And I began teaching there.

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:07.976
I taught English, and I met
some incredible women there.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.788
I met people that live
seven people to a room,

00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:15.144
barely can afford their evening meal,

00:04:15.168 --> 00:04:18.691
yet lived with this strength
of spirit and sense of humor

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:21.397
and just incredible qualities.

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:25.175
I got drawn into this community
and I began to take pictures there.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.976
I took pictures of weddings
and older family members --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.109
things that they wanted memories of.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.546
About two years after I started
taking these pictures,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.976
the UN Conference
on Population and Development

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.896
asked me to show them at the conference.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.868
So I was 18; I was very excited.

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:54.249
It was my first exhibit of photographs
and they were all put up there,

00:04:54.273 --> 00:05:00.238
and after about two days,
they all came down except for three.

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.639
People were very upset,

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:06.273
very angry that I was showing
these dirty sides of Cairo,

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:09.754
and why didn't I cut
the dead donkey out of the frame?

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.015
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.637
I looked at this big empty wall
with three lonely photographs

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:21.915
that were, you know,
very pretty photographs

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.830
and I was like, "I failed at this."

00:05:24.854 --> 00:05:29.977
But I was looking at this intense
emotion and intense feeling

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:33.454
that had come out of people
just seeing these photographs.

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:36.459
Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak
that nobody listened to,

00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:39.261
and all of a sudden,
I put these photographs on the wall,

00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:41.917
and there were arguments,
and they had to be taken down.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.289
And I saw the power of the image,
and it was incredible.

00:05:45.313 --> 00:05:49.147
And I think the most important reaction
that I saw there was actually from people

00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:52.046
that would never have gone
to the garbage village themselves,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.935
that would never have seen
that the human spirit could thrive

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:57.043
in such difficult circumstances.

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:58.599
And I think it was at that point

00:05:58.623 --> 00:06:02.885
that I decided I wanted to use
photography and film

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.351
to somehow bridge gaps,
to bridge cultures,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:08.314
bring people together, cross borders.

00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:14.349
And so that's what really
kind of started me off.

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:17.678
Did a stint at MTV, made a film
called "Startup.com,"

00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:21.976
and I've done a couple of music films.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.976
But in 2003, when the war
in Iraq was about to start,

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:31.677
it was a very surreal feeling for me,

00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.577
because before the war started,

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.013
there was kind of this media war
that was going on.

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:38.053
And I was watching television in New York,

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:41.714
and there seemed to be just one
point of view that was coming across,

00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:46.565
and the coverage went
from the US State Department

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.626
to embedded troops.

00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:51.707
And what was coming across on the news

00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:55.976
was that there was going to be this
clean war and precision bombings,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.774
and the Iraqis would be greeting
the Americans as liberators,

00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:03.074
and throwing flowers at their feet
in the streets of Baghdad.

00:07:03.098 --> 00:07:05.971
And I knew that there
was a completely other story

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:09.013
that was taking place in the Middle East,
where my parents were.

00:07:09.037 --> 00:07:12.102
I knew that there was
a completely other story being told,

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:15.658
and I was thinking, "How are people
supposed to communicate with each other

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:18.075
when they're getting completely
different messages,

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.206
and nobody knows
what the other's being told?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.247
How are people supposed to have
any kind of common understanding

00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:25.906
or know how to move together
into the future?

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.178
So I knew that I had to go there.

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:30.242
I just wanted to be in the center.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.767
I had no plan. I had no funding.

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:36.976
I didn't even have a camera at the time --
I had somebody bring it there,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.976
because I wanted
to get access to Al Jazeera,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.976
George Bush's favorite channel,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.241
and a place which I was very curious
about because it's disliked

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:49.756
by many governments across the Arab world,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.382
and also called the mouthpiece
of Osama Bin Laden

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.587
by some people in the US government.

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:59.885
So I was thinking, this station
that's hated by so many people

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:01.442
has to be doing something right.

00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:04.975
I've got to go see what this is all about.

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.096
And I also wanted to go see
Central Command,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.664
which was 10 minutes away.

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:13.976
And that way, I could get access
to how this news was being created --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.208
on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:18.991
and on the US and Western side,
reaching the US.

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:20.756
And when I went there and sat there,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.837
and met these people
that were in the center of it,

00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:27.467
and sat with these characters,

00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.768
I met some surprising,
very complex people.

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:35.976
And I'd like to share with you
a little bit of that experience

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.474
of when you sit with somebody

00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:39.522
and you film them, and you listen to them,

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:42.516
and you allow them more
than a five-second sound bite.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:48.000
The amazing complexity of people emerges.

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:53.976
Samir Khader: Business as usual.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.350
Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.

00:09:00.897 --> 00:09:05.674
But between us, if I'm offered
a job with Fox, I'll take it.

00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:15.270
To change the Arab nightmare
into the American dream.

00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:23.205
I still have that dream.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.976
Maybe I will never be able to do it,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.720
but I have plans for my children.

00:09:30.524 --> 00:09:31.914
When they finish high school,

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.954
I will send them to America
to study there.

00:09:33.978 --> 00:09:35.723
I will pay for their study.

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.590
And they will stay there.

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:49.028
Josh Rushing: The night they showed
the POWs and the dead soldiers --

00:09:49.052 --> 00:09:50.268
Al Jazeera showed them --

00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:53.496
it was powerful, because America
doesn't show those kinds of images.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.205
Most of the news in America
won't show really gory images

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:59.404
and this showed American soldiers
in uniform, strewn about a floor,

00:09:59.428 --> 00:10:00.603
a cold tile floor.

00:10:00.627 --> 00:10:03.363
And it was revolting.

00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:04.873
It was absolutely revolting.

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:06.349
It made me sick at my stomach.

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:09.699
And then what hit me was,
the night before,

00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:13.318
there had been some kind
of bombing in Basra,

00:10:13.342 --> 00:10:18.158
and Al Jazeera had shown
images of the people.

00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:22.376
And they were equally, if not more,
horrifying -- the images were.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.015
And I remember having seen it
in the Al Jazeera office,

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:28.228
and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.

00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:30.043
That's bad."

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:32.977
And then going away, and probably
eating dinner or something.

00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.604
And it didn't affect me as much.

00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:37.451
So, the impact that had on me --

00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:41.133
me realizing that I just saw
people on the other side,

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:43.969
and those people in the Al Jazeera office

00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:46.280
must have felt the way
I was feeling that night,

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:49.423
and it upset me on a profound level

00:10:49.447 --> 00:10:53.031
that I wasn't as bothered
as much the night before.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.222
It makes me hate war.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.228
But it doesn't make me believe
that we're in a world

00:10:58.252 --> 00:10:59.763
that can live without war yet.

00:10:59.787 --> 00:11:02.880
Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed
by the response of the film.

00:11:02.904 --> 00:11:05.587
We didn't know whether
it would be able to get out there.

00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:06.827
We had no funding for it.

00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:10.141
We were incredibly lucky
that it got picked up.

00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:13.534
And when we showed the film

00:11:13.558 --> 00:11:16.234
in both the United States
and the Arab world,

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:18.375
we had such incredible reactions.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:21.407
It was amazing to see how people
were moved by this film.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.594
In the Arab world --

00:11:23.618 --> 00:11:26.455
and it's not really by the film,
it's by the characters --

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:30.510
I mean, Josh Rushing was
this incredibly complex person

00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:32.061
who was thinking about things.

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:34.354
And when I showed the film
in the Middle East,

00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:36.976
people wanted to meet Josh.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
He kind of redefined us
as an American population.

00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:44.976
People started to ask me,
"Where is this guy now?"

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.999
Al Jazeera offered him a job.

00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:48.976
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.250
And Samir, on the other hand,

00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:54.608
was also quite an interesting character
for the Arab world to see,

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:58.289
because it brought out the complexities
of this love-hate relationship

00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:00.431
that the Arab world has with the West.

00:12:01.257 --> 00:12:06.448
In the United States, I was blown away
by the motivations,

00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:09.296
the positive motivations
of the American people

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.390
when they'd see this film.

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:13.009
You know, we're criticized abroad

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:16.524
for believing we're the saviors
of the world in some way,

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:19.867
but the flip side of it is that, actually,

00:12:19.891 --> 00:12:22.225
when people do see
what is happening abroad

00:12:22.249 --> 00:12:24.976
and people's reactions
to some of our policy abroad,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.270
we feel this power, that we need to --

00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:29.889
we feel like we have to get
the power to change things.

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:31.468
And I saw this with audiences.

00:12:31.492 --> 00:12:35.248
This woman came up to me
after the screening and said,

00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:36.865
"You know, I know this is crazy.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.912
I saw the bombs being loaded
on the planes,

00:12:38.936 --> 00:12:40.675
I saw the military going out to war,

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:43.061
but you don't understand
people's anger towards us

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:47.248
until you see the people in the hospitals
and the victims of the war,

00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:49.217
and how do we get out of this bubble?

00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:53.172
How do we understand what
the other person is thinking?"

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.071
Now, I don't know whether
a film can change the world.

00:12:58.095 --> 00:13:00.572
But I know the power of it,

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:03.976
I know that it starts people thinking
about how to change the world.

00:13:04.613 --> 00:13:06.303
Now, I'm not a philosopher,

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.185
so I feel like I shouldn't
go into great depth on this,

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:12.976
but let film speak for itself
and take you to this other world.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.100
Because I believe that film has
the ability to take you across borders,

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:21.142
I'd like you to just sit back
and experience for a couple of minutes

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:22.976
being taken into another world.

doing is destroying us?]

an alibi to carry on?]

[Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?]

to turn it into a moral war.]

00:18:41.372 --> 00:18:45.014
Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's
had that feeling of sitting in a theater,

00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:49.284
in a dark room, with other strangers,
watching a very powerful film,

00:18:49.308 --> 00:18:52.023
and they felt that feeling
of transformation.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.292
And what I'd like to talk about is

00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:57.976
how can we use that feeling

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.358
to actually create
a movement through film?

00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:07.358
I've been listening to the talks
in the conference,

00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:09.437
and Robert Wright said yesterday

00:19:09.461 --> 00:19:13.029
that if we have an appreciation
for another person's humanity,

00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:15.585
then they will have
an appreciation for ours.

00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:17.407
And that's what this is about.

00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:19.976
It's about connecting people through film,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.741
getting these independent
voices out there.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.184
Now, Josh Rushing actually
ended up leaving the military

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:31.572
(Laughter)

00:19:31.596 --> 00:19:35.183
So his feeling is that
he's at Al Jazeera International

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.976
because he feels like
he can actually use media

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.407
to bridge the gap between East and West.

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:43.384
And that's an amazing thing.

00:19:43.408 --> 00:19:46.240
But I've been trying to think about ways

00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:48.924
to give power to these independent voices,

00:19:48.948 --> 00:19:50.541
to give power to the filmmakers,

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:54.976

to use film for change.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.849

and getting interviews
out there and using this film

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.698

that it's a powerful tool,

00:20:14.722 --> 00:20:19.261

her daughter killed in an attack,

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:22.411

are peaceful ways to solve this.

for people around the world

I've watched it and I'm blown away by it

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:39.810
and its potential to bring voices
from around the world --

00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:41.842
independent voices
from around the world --

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.302
and create a truly democratic,
global television.

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:49.077
So what can we do to create
a platform for these organizations,

00:20:49.101 --> 00:20:50.976
to create some momentum,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.391
to get everybody in the world
involved in this movement?

00:20:56.494 --> 00:20:59.509
I'd like for us to imagine for a second.

00:21:01.198 --> 00:21:08.029
Imagine a day when you have everyone
coming together from around the world.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.708
You have towns and villages
and theaters --

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:18.286
all from around the world,

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.049
getting together, and sitting in the dark,

00:21:21.073 --> 00:21:25.573
and sharing a communal
experience of watching a film,

00:21:25.597 --> 00:21:27.720
or a couple of films, together.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.482
Watching a film which maybe highlights
a character that is fighting to live,

00:21:34.506 --> 00:21:37.680
or just a character
that defies stereotypes,

00:21:37.704 --> 00:21:39.773
makes a joke, sings a song.

00:21:39.797 --> 00:21:42.076
Comedies, documentaries, shorts.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.779
This amazing power
can be used to change people

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:47.627
and to bond people together;
to cross borders,

00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:51.166
and have people feel like
they're having a communal experience.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.136
So if you imagine this day
when all around the world,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.679
you have theaters and places
where we project films.

00:21:59.703 --> 00:22:03.298
If you imagine projecting
from Times Square

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.100
to Tahrir Square in Cairo,

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:09.800
the same film in Ramallah,
the same film in Jerusalem.

00:22:09.824 --> 00:22:13.124
You know, we've been talking
to a friend of mine

00:22:13.148 --> 00:22:15.822
about using the side of the Great Pyramid

00:22:15.846 --> 00:22:17.505
and the Great Wall of China.

00:22:20.175 --> 00:22:22.976
It's endless what you can imagine,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.112
in terms of where you can project films

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.860
and where you can have
this communal experience.

00:22:27.884 --> 00:22:30.976
And I believe that this one day,
if we can create it,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.351
this one day can create momentum
for all of these independent voices.

00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:40.404
There isn't an organization
which is connecting the independent voices

00:22:40.428 --> 00:22:41.976
of the world to get out there,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.180
and yet I'm hearing
throughout this conference

00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:46.234
that the biggest challenge in our future

00:22:46.258 --> 00:22:47.870
is understanding the other,

00:22:47.894 --> 00:22:51.827
and having mutual respect
for the other and crossing borders.

00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:53.724
And if film can do that,

00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:56.926
and if we can get all of these
different locations in the world

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.554
to watch these films together --

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:01.735
this could be an incredible day.

00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:05.540
So we've already made a partnership,

00:23:05.564 --> 00:23:09.453
set up through somebody
from the TED community,

00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:12.347
John Camen, who introduced me
to Steven Apkon,

00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:14.976
from the Jacob Burns Film Center.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.890
And we started calling up everybody.

00:23:16.914 --> 00:23:18.273
And in the last week,

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:21.976
there have been so many people
that have responded to us,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.976
from as close as Palo Alto,
to Mongolia and to India.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.556
There are people that want to be
a part of this global day of film;

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.976
to be able to provide a platform
for independent voices

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.564
and independent films to get out there.

00:23:39.183 --> 00:23:42.846
Now, we've thought
about a name for this day,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.329
and I'd like to share this with you.

00:23:45.353 --> 00:23:47.614
Now, the most amazing part
of this whole process

00:23:47.638 --> 00:23:50.966
has been sharing ideas and wishes,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.976
and so I invite you
to give brainstorms onto

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.521
how does this day echo into the future?

00:23:57.545 --> 00:24:02.276
How do we use technology to make
this day echo into the future,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.976
so that we can build community

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
and have these communities working
together, through the Internet?

00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:11.690
There was a time, many, many years ago,

00:24:11.714 --> 00:24:14.000
when all of the continents
were stuck together.

00:24:14.925 --> 00:24:17.870
And we call that landmass Pangea.

00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:22.487
So what we'd like to call this day of film
is Pangea Cinema Day.

00:24:23.614 --> 00:24:25.113
And if you just imagine

00:24:25.137 --> 00:24:28.620
that all of these people
in these towns would be watching,

00:24:28.644 --> 00:24:32.633
then I think that we can
actually really make a movement

00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:34.976
towards people understanding
each other better.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.819
I know that it's very intangible,
touching people's hearts and souls,

00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:40.876
but the only way that I know how to do it,

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.485
the only way that I know how to reach out
to somebody's heart and soul

00:24:45.509 --> 00:24:48.016
all across the world,
is by showing them a film.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.401
And I know that there are independent
filmmakers and films out there

00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:53.489
that can really make this happen.

00:24:54.072 --> 00:24:55.615
And that's my wish.

00:24:56.154 --> 00:25:00.601
I guess I'm supposed to give you
my one-sentence wish,

00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:02.403
but we're way out of time.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.320
Chris Anderson:
That is an incredible wish.

00:25:05.344 --> 00:25:07.976
Pangea Cinema: The day
the world comes together.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.718
JN: It's more tangible than world peace,
and it's certainly more immediate.

00:25:11.742 --> 00:25:17.460
But it would be the day that the world
comes together through film,

00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:18.635
the power of film.

00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:21.000
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.
