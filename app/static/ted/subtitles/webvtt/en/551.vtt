00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Two years ago here at TED

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I reported that we had discovered

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an anomalously warm and geologically active region

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Enceladus, seen here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This region seen here for the first time

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And seen just recently in late 2008,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
here is that region again,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is experiencing the onset of August

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and eventually winter.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this once-in-a-lifetime discovery

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of towering jets

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
erupting from those fractures at the south pole,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
consisting of tiny water ice crystals

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
accompanied by water vapor

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And at that time two years ago

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I mentioned that we were speculating

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that these jets might in fact be geysers,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and erupting from pockets

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but we weren't really sure.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
However, the implications of those results --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of a possible environment within this moon

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that could support prebiotic chemistry,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and perhaps life itself --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we have focused more on Enceladus.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
by this moon now several times,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
flying closer and deeper into these jets,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
into the denser regions of these jets,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so that now we have come away with some

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
very precise compositional measurements.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And we have found

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that the organic compounds coming from this moon

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
are in fact more complex than we previously reported.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
While they're not amino acids,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we're now finding things like

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
propane and benzene,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the tiny water crystals here

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
now look for all the world

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
like they are frozen droplets of salty water,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which is a discovery that suggests

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that not only do the jets come from

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
pockets of liquid water,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And that is a circumstance

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that could supply the chemical energy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So we are very encouraged by these results.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that we might indeed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
have on this moon, under the south pole,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is an entirely different matter.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And that will have to await the arrival,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
back at Enceladus,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
specifically equipped to address that particular question.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
when we might journey to the Saturnine system,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
just because we can.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Thank you.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
