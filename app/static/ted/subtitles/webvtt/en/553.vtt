00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here because I have a very important message:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I think we have found

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the most important factor for success.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And it was found close to here, Stanford.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and put them in a room all by themselves.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for 15 minutes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you will get another one. So you will have two."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for something that they like,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Exact equivalent.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So what happened when the professor left the room?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
As soon as the door closed...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
two out of three ate the marshmallow.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Couldn't do it. Could not wait.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What's interesting is that one out of three

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Would look at it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Put it back.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That child already, at four, understood

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the most important principle for success,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is the ability to delay gratification.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Self-discipline:

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the most important factor for success.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
follow-up study.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What did they find?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And they found that 100 percent

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They were happy. They had their plans.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They had good relationships with the teachers, students.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They were doing fine.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
they were in trouble.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They did not make it to university.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
A few were still there with bad grades.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
A few had good grades.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
react the same way as the American kids?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And let me show you what happened.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
(Spanish) (Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So what happened in Colombia?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
one out of three did not.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This little girl was interesting;

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
she ate the inside of the marshmallow.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
(Laughter)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But she ate it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(Laughter)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
She should not go into banking, for example,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or work at a cash register.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But she will be successful.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And this applies for everything. Even in sales.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The sales person that --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are."

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That person ate the marshmallow.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Then you sell a lot more.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So this has applications in all walks of life.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I end with -- the Koreans did this.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You know what? This is so good

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that we want a marshmallow book for children.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And we need to learn that principle here in the States,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
because we have a big debt.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Thank you so much.
