00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:03.976
Let's talk about manias.

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:06.649
Let's start with Beatlemania.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.849
(Recording of crowd roaring)

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:10.976
Hysterical teenagers,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.171
crying, screaming, pandemonium.

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:17.464
(Recording of crowd roaring)

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:18.976
Sports mania:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
deafening crowds,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.271
all for one idea --
get the ball in the net.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:27.976
(Recording) Goal!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.976
Okay, religious mania:

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.976
there's rapture, there's weeping,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.976
there's visions.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.984
Manias can be good.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:38.984
Manias can be alarming.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.291
Or manias can be deadly.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.899
(Recording of crowd cheering)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.976
The world has a new mania.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.976
A mania for learning English.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:54.150
Listen as Chinese students
practice their English,

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:55.976
by screaming it:

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.096
Teacher: ... change my life!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.531
Students: I want to change my life!

00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:03.618
T: I don't want to let my parents down!

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:06.976
S: I don't want to let my parents down!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.344
T: I don't ever want
to let my country down!

00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:13.976
S: I don't ever want
to let my country down!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.539
T: Most importantly...
S: Most importantly...

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:20.247
T: I don't want to let myself down!

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.976
S: I don't want to let myself down!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.143
How many people
are trying to learn English worldwide?

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.666
Two billion of them.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.976
Students: A t-shirt. A dress.

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:34.446
Jay Walker: In Latin America,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.120
in India,

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:37.771
in Southeast Asia,

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:39.841
and most of all, in China.

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.976
If you're a Chinese student,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.650
you start learning English
in the third grade, by law.

00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:49.190
That's why this year,

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:53.976
China will become the world's largest
English-speaking country.

00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:56.206
(Laughter)

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.548
Why English?

00:01:57.572 --> 00:01:59.737
In a single word: opportunity.

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.563
Opportunity for a better life, a job,

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:05.976
to be able to pay for school,
or put better food on the table.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.539
Imagine a student taking
a giant test for three full days.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:15.016
Her score on this one test
literally determines her future.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.524
She studies 12 hours a day

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:19.899
for three years to prepare.

00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:24.867
Twenty-five percent of her grade
is based on English.

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:29.955
It's called the gaokao, and 80 million
high school Chinese students

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.351
have already taken this grueling test.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:34.644
The intensity to learn English

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:38.595
is almost unimaginable,
unless you witness it.

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.406
Teacher: Perfect!
Students: Perfect!

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.976
T: Perfect!
S: Perfect!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.420
T: I want to speak perfect English!

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:47.741
S: I want to speak perfect English!

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.048
T: I want to speak ...
S: I want to speak ...

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:52.818
T: ... perfect English!
S: ... perfect English!

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.976
T (yelling more loudly):
I want to change my life!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.952
S (yelling more loudly):
I want to change my life!

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.976
JW: So is English mania good or bad?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.309
Is English a tsunami,
washing away other languages?

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.555
Not likely.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.801
English is the world's second language.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.571
Your native language is your life.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:17.531
But with English you can become
part of a wider conversation --

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:21.261
a global conversation
about global problems,

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:23.976
like climate change or poverty,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.976
or hunger or disease.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.475
The world has other universal languages.

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.976
Mathematics is the language of science.

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.976
Music is the language of emotions.

00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:40.976
And now English is becoming
the language of problem-solving.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.214
Not because America is pushing it,

00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:45.976
but because the world is pulling it.

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:49.639
So English mania is a turning point.

00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:52.671
Like the harnessing
of electricity in our cities,

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:54.976
or the fall of the Berlin Wall,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.362
English represents hope

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:58.976
for a better future --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.976
a future where the world
has a common language

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.648
to solve its common problems.

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:07.198
Thank you very much.

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:10.722
(Applause)
