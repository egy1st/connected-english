WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is my first trip,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
my first foreign trip as a first lady.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Can you believe that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Applause)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is based not only on the relationship between governments,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but the common language and the values that we share,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
During my visit I've been especially honored

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
women who are paving the way for all of you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I'm honored to meet you,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and you, just getting through school,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I want you to know that we have very much in common.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For nothing in my life's path

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
would have predicted that I'd be standing here

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
as the first African-American First Lady

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of the United States of America.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or any social standing to speak of.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's the real part of Chicago.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I was the product of a working-class community.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
My father was a city worker all of his life,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Neither of them attended university.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in the prime of his life.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But even as it got harder for him to walk

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and get dressed in the morning --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I saw him struggle more and more --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
my father never complained about his struggle.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
He was grateful for what he had.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
love, strong values

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and a belief that with a good education

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and a whole lot of hard work,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that there was nothing that we could not do.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I am an example of what's possible

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
when girls from the very beginning of their lives

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
are loved and nurtured by the people around them.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And my mother, the most important role model in my life,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
who lives with us at the White House

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and helps to care for our two little daughters,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Malia and Sasha.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and is instilling in them

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the same values that she taught me and my brother:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
things like compassion, and integrity,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and confidence, and perseverance --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that only a grandmother can give.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
by some strong male role models as well,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
They taught me about what a respectful relationship

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
should look like between men and women.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that it's built on faith and commitment

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They taught me about what it means

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to be a father

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and to raise a family.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And not only to invest in your own home

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
but to reach out and help raise kids

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in the broader community.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And these were the same qualities

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that I looked for in my own husband,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Barack Obama.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And when we first met,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Laughter)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I know, how romantic.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
He worked, helping people to find jobs

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
As he talked to the residents in that community center,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
he talked about two concepts.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What he said, that all too often,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But Barack reminded us on that day,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
all of us in that room, that we all know

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
what our world should look like.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We all know.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And he urged the people in that meeting,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in that community,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to devote themselves to closing the gap

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
between those two ideas,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to work together to try to make the world as it is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and the world as it should be, one and the same.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I think about that today because I am

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
reminded and convinced that all of you in this school

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are very important parts of closing that gap.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You're going to write the next chapter in history.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and generations to come.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And that's why getting a good education

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
is so important.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That's why all of this that you're going through --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
why it's so important.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
are only as strong as the health of their women.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And that's important to keep in mind.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Part of that health includes an outstanding education.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is often the presence of an empowered woman

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
or women at the center of that family.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
is often the healthy respect between men and women

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The difference between a languishing nation

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and one that will flourish

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is the recognition that we need equal access to education

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
for both boys and girls.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Mary Seacole,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and the English author, Emily Bronte,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
They allowed for no obstacles.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
They knew no other way to live

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
than to follow their dreams.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And having done so, these women

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
moved many obstacles.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And they opened many new doors

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
for millions of female doctors and nurses

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and artists and authors,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
all of whom have followed them.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And by getting a good education,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
you too can control your own destiny.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Please remember that.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
it's because of education.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I never did it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I loved getting As.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I liked being smart.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And you too, with these same values,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
can control your own destiny.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You too can pave the way.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You too can realize your dreams,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and then your job is to reach back

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and to help someone just like you do the same thing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
History proves that it doesn't matter

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
whether you come from a council estate

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or a country estate.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Your success will be determined

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
by your own fortitude,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
your own confidence, your own individual hard work.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You now have control over your own destiny.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But you have everything you need.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Everything you need to succeed,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you already have, right here.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
My husband works in this big office.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
They call it the Oval Office.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
it's called the Resolute desk.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and given by Queen Victoria.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And its name, Resolute,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is a reminder of the strength of character that's required

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
not only to lead a country,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
but to live a life of purpose, as well.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that you go forward without limits,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
it's there --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that you use them to create the world as it should be.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Because we are counting on you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We are counting on every single one of you

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to be the very best that you can be.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Because the world is big.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And it's full of challenges.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And we need strong, smart, confident young women
