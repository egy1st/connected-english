00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All human life,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
all life, depends on plants.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Just think for a moment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or you live in a big city,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
everything comes back to plants in the end:

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
whether it's for the food, the medicine,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that matter to us so much;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or whether it's soil formation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or the effect on the atmosphere,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or primary production.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Damn it, even the books here are made out of plants.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
All these things, they come back to plants.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And without them we wouldn't be here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now plants are under threat.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They're under threat because of changing climate.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with people like us.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and their habitats.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And whether that's because of food production,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or because of the introduction of alien plants

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
into places that they really oughtn't be,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
or because of habitats being used for other purposes --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or die, or move.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because there might be cities and other things in the way.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So if all human life depends on plants,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I think it does.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the way that you save plants

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is by storing seeds.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
are plants' futures.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
All the genetic information for future generations of plants

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
are held in seeds.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So here is the building;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it looks rather unassuming, really.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But it goes down below ground many stories.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It exists not only in southern England,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but distributed around the world. I'll come to that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is a nuclear-proof facility.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
God forbid that it should have to withstand that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
what you're going to store in it. Right?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And we decided that what we want to store first of all,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
are the species that are most under threat.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And those are the dry land species.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So first of all we did deals

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
with 50 different countries.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It means negotiating with heads of state,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and with secretaries of state in 50 countries

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to sign treaties.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We have 120 partner institutions all over the world,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in all those countries colored orange.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
People come from all over the world to learn,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then they go away and plan exactly how

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
they're going to collect these seeds.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They have thousands of people all over the world

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
tagging places where those plants are said to exist.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They search for them. They find them in flower.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And they go back when their seeds have arrived.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And they collect the seeds. All over the world.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
some low-tech things here and there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the main thing is that you have to dry them

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
very carefully, at low temperature.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And then you have to store them

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
at about minus 20 degrees C --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
with a very critically low moisture content.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And these seeds will be able to germinate,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
we believe, with many of the species,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in thousands of years,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and certainly in hundreds of years.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So every 10 years we do germination tests

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
on every sample of seeds that we have.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And this is a distributed network.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So all around the world people are doing the same thing.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And that enables us to develop germination protocols.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That means that we know the right combination of heat

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and cold and the cycles that you have to get

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to make the seed germinate.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And that is very useful information.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then we grow these things,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"Look, actually we're not just storing this

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to get the seeds later,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but we can give you this information about

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
how to germinate these difficult plants."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And that's already happening.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So where have we got to?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that's three thousand millionth seed --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is now stored.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
24,000 species are safe;

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Twenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
These are not just crop plants,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
fantastic work there.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is at least 100 times bigger.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We have thousands of collections that have been sent out

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
all over the world:

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
especially photosynthetic-efficient plants

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
come here to the United States;

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the list goes on and on.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
These seeds are used for restoration.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So in habitats that have already been damaged,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
like the tall grass prairie here in the USA,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
or in mined land in various countries,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
restoration is already happening because of these species --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and because of this collection.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to the left of your screen,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
they are down to the last few remaining members.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Fantastically useful plant,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
both for protein and for medicine.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We have training going on in China, in the USA,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and many other countries.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
How much does it cost?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
2,800 dollars per species is the average.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I think that's cheap, at the price.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And that gets you all the scientific data

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that goes with it.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The future research is "How can we find

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the genetic and molecular markers

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
for the viability of seeds,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
without having to plant them every 10 years?"

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And we're almost there.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
(Applause)
