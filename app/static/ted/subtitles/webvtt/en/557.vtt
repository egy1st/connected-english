00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was thinking about my place in the universe,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when I was a child.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I thought that if time could reach

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
forwards and backwards infinitely,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
doesn't that mean that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
every point in time is really infinitely small,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and therefore somewhat meaningless.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we don't really have a place in the universe,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as far as on a time line.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But nothing else does either.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that's ever happened, including this moment right now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so therefore this music you're about to hear

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is maybe the most important music

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you'll ever hear in your life.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Applause)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
(Applause)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Thank you.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Applause)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
(Applause)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
you could please refrain from saying,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
(Laughter)

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
for some reason.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
(Laughter)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Somewhat like the curving of the universe.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
(Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Laughter)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(Applause)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Thank you very much.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:31.000
(Applause)
