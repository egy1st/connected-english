00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
College presidents are not the first people who come to mind

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The story begins in the late '90s.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was invited to meet with leading educators

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Since education under the Soviet Union

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was essentially propaganda

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
serving the purposes of a state ideology,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
if they were to provide an education

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
worthy of free men and women.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Given this rare opportunity

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to start fresh,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
they chose liberal arts

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
as the most compelling model

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because of its historic commitment

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to furthering its students' broadest intellectual,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and deepest ethical potential.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Having made that decision

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
they came to the United States,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
home of liberal arts education,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to talk with some of us

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
most closely identified

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
with that kind of education.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They spoke with a passion, an urgency,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
an intellectual conviction

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a dream long forgotten.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For, in truth, we had moved light years

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
from the passions that animated them.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But for me, unlike them,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in my world, the slate was not clean,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and what was written on it was not encouraging.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In truth, liberal arts education

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
no longer exists --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We have professionalized liberal arts to the point

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where they no longer provide the breadth of application

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that is their signature.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Over the past century

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the expert has dethroned the educated generalist

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to become the sole model

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Expertise has for sure had its moments.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But the price of its dominance is enormous.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Subject matters are broken up

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You may think you know what is going on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in that Jane Austen novel --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that is, until your first encounter

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
with postmodern deconstructionism.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The progression of today's college student

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is to jettison every interest except one.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
learning more and more about less and less;

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
this, despite the evidence all around us

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of the interconnectedness of things.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Lest you think I exaggerate,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
As one moves up the ladder,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
values other than technical competence

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
are viewed with increasing suspicion.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Questions such as,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"What kind of a world are we making?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
What kind of a world should we be making?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
What kind of a world can we be making?"

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
are treated with more and more skepticism,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and move off the table.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in effect yield the connection

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
between education and values

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to fundamentalists,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
who, you can be sure,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
have no compunctions about using education

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to further their values:

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the absolutes of a theocracy.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Either we have lost touch with those values

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
or, no better,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
believe they need not

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or cannot be taught.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
This aversion to social values

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
may seem at odds with the explosion

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of community service programs.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But despite the attention paid to these efforts,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
they remain emphatically extracurricular.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
In effect, civic-mindedness is treated

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
as outside the realm of what purports to be

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
serious thinking and adult purposes.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the academy is more likely to engender

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a learned helplessness

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
than to create a sense of empowerment.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This brew -- oversimplification of civic engagement,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
idealization of the expert,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
fragmentation of knowledge,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
emphasis on technical mastery,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
neutrality as a condition of academic integrity --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
between education and the public good,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
between intellectual integrity

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and human freedom,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which were at the heart --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Applause) -- of the challenge posed to and by

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
my European colleagues.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
When the astronomical distance

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
between the realities of the academy

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and the visionary intensity of this challenge

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
were more than enough, I can assure you,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to give one pause,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
what was happening outside higher education

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
made backing off unthinkable.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Whether it was threats to the environment,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
inequities in the distribution of wealth,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
with respect to the continuing uses of energy,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we were in desperate straits.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And that was only the beginning.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The corrupting of our political life

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
had become a living nightmare;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
nothing was exempt --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
separation of powers, civil liberties,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the rule of law,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the relationship of church and state.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Accompanied by a squandering

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of the nation's material wealth

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that defied credulity.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
had become commonplace,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
with an equal distaste

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
for the alternative forms of influence.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
when it came to halting or even stemming

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Our public education, once a model for the world,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
has become most noteworthy

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
for its failures.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
eludes vast numbers of our students.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Despite having a research establishment

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that is the envy of the world,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
more than half of the American public

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
don't believe in evolution.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And don't press your luck

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
about how much those who do believe in it

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
actually understand it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Incredibly, this nation,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
seems utterly helpless

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Equally startling, from my point of view,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
is the fact that no one

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
was drawing any connections

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
between what is happening to the body politic,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We may be at the top of the list

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We are not even on the list

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
when it comes to our responsibility

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
for the health of this democracy.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We are playing with fire.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You can be sure Jefferson knew

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
what he was talking about when he said,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
in a state of civilization,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it expects what never was,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and never will be."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Applause)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
On a more personal note,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
this betrayal of our principles,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
our decency, our hope,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
made it impossible for me

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to avoid the question,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
"What will I say, years from now,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
when people ask, 'Where were you?'"

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
As president of a leading liberal arts college,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
famous for its innovative history,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
there were no excuses.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So the conversation began at Bennington.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Knowing that if we were to regain

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the integrity of liberal education,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it would take radical rethinking

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
of basic assumptions,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
beginning with our priorities.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The accomplishment of civic virtue

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
at their most challenging.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Our ways of approaching agency and authority

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
turn inside out to reflect the reality

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that no one has the answers

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to the challenges facing citizens in this century,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and everyone has the responsibility

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for trying and participating in finding them.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in personal and professional objectives.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But the balances redressed,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
our shared purposes assume an equal

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
if not greater importance.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
from health and education

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to the uses of force --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the organizers of the curriculum.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
mutually dependent circles,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
rather than isolating triangles.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And the point is not to treat these topics

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
as topics of study,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
but as frameworks of action.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
The challenge: to figure out what it will take

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to actually do something

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that makes a significant and sustainable difference.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Contrary to widely held assumptions,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
equity, truth,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
becomes increasingly evident

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
as students discover that interest alone

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
cannot tell them what they need to know

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when the issue is rethinking education,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
our approach to health,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
or strategies for achieving

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
an economics of equity.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The value of the past also comes alive;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
it provides a lot of company.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You are not the first to try to figure this out,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
just as you are unlikely to be the last.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Even more valuable,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
history provides a laboratory

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in which we see played out

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
the actual, as well as the intended

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
consequences of ideas.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
In the language of my students,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
"Deep thought matters

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
when you're contemplating what to do

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
about things that matter."

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
A new liberal arts that can support this

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
action-oriented curriculum

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
has begun to emerge.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to maximum effect.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Design, the art of organizing the world of things.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Mediation and improvisation

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
also assume a special place in this new pantheon.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
at the heart of what it takes to manage change

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
where measurement is crucial.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
As is a capacity to discriminate

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
systematically between what is at the core

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and what is at the periphery.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And when making connections is of the essence,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the power of technology emerges with special intensity.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
But so does the importance of content.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The more powerful our reach,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
the more important the question "About what?"

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
artists, at long last,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
take their place at the table,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
In this dramatically expanded ideal

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
of a liberal arts education

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
knowledge honed outside the academy

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
becomes essential.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Social activists, business leaders,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
lawyers, politicians, professionals

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to engage the world directly.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And of course, this new wine

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
needs new bottles

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
of this idea.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
The most important discovery we made

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
in our focus on public action

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
was to appreciate that the hard choices

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
are not between good and evil,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
but between competing goods.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
This discovery is transforming.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
It undercuts self-righteousness,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
radically alters the tone and character of controversy,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and enriches dramatically

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the possibilities for finding common ground.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Ideology, zealotry,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This is a political education, to be sure.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But it is a politics of principle,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
not of partisanship.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is the architect's sketch of a building

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
opening in 2010

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that is to be a center for the advancement

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
of public action.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Think of it as a kind of secular church.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
We intend to turn the intellectual

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and imaginative power, passion and boldness

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
of our students, faculty and staff

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to developing strategies

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
for acting on the critical challenges of our time.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So we are doing our job.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
While these past weeks have been a time

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
of national exhilaration in this country,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
it would be tragic if you thought this meant

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
your job was done.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
The glacial silence we have experienced

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in the face of the shredding of the constitution,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
the unraveling of our public institutions,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
the deterioration of our infrastructure

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
is not limited to the universities.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
We the people

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
have become inured to our own irrelevance

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
when it comes to doing anything significant

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
about anything that matters

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
concerning governance,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
beyond waiting another four years.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We persist also

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in being sidelined by the idea of the expert

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
as the only one capable of coming up with answers,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The problem is there is no such thing

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
as a viable democracy made up of experts,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
zealots, politicians and spectators.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
(Applause)

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
People will continue and should continue

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to learn everything there is to know about something or other.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We actually do it all the time.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And there will be and should be

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
those who spend a lifetime

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But this single-mindedness will not yield

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
the flexibilities of mind,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
the multiplicity of perspectives,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
the capacities for collaboration and innovation

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
this country needs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
That is where you come in.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
What is certain is that the individual talent

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
exhibited in such abundance here,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
needs to turn its attention

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to that collaborative, messy, frustrating,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
contentious and impossible world

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
of politics and public policy.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
President Obama and his team

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
simply cannot do it alone.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
If the question of where to start seems overwhelming

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Being overwhelmed is the first step

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
on a scale that makes a difference.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Well, you have two things.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
You have a mind. And you have other people.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Start with those, and change the world.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
(Applause)
