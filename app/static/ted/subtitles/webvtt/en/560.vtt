00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Information technology grows in an exponential manner.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we made linear predictions where that animal would be,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But the pace of exponential growth

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is really what describes information technologies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it's not just computation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I get to 30.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If I take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I get to a billion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It makes a huge difference.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And that really describes information technology.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I was a student at MIT,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we all shared one computer that took up a whole building.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
a million times smaller,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a thousand times more powerful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that we've actually experienced since I was a student.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Information technology progresses

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
through a series of S-curves

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
where each one is a different paradigm.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Which will happen around 2020.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We'll then go to the next paradigm.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to bring exponential growth to computing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The exponential growth of computing started

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
decades before Gordon Moore was even born.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And it doesn't just apply to computation.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's really any technology where we can measure

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the underlying information properties.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Here we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because this represents trillions-fold increase

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
since the 1890 census.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and finally integrated circuits.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But what's even more amazing, really, than this

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
fantastic scale of progress,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is that -- look at how predictable this is.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I mean this went through thick and thin,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
through war and peace, through boom times and recessions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
At least the exponential growth of information technology capability

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
will continue unabated.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I just updated these graphs.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Because I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So we updated them,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so I could present it here, to 2007.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I was a little nervous

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because maybe the data wouldn't be right,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but I've done this now for 30 years,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it has stayed on this exponential progression.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You can buy half a billion today,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and they are actually better, because they are faster.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But look at how predictable this is.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And the cost of a transistor cycle,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which is a measure of the price performance of electronics,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
comes down about every year.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
That's a 50 percent deflation rate.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And it's also true of other examples,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
like DNA data or brain data.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But we more than make up for that.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We actually ship more than twice as much

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
of every form of information technology.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in every form of information technology for the last half-century,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This is a completely different example.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This is not Moore's Law.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The amount of DNA data

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we've sequenced has doubled every year.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The cost has come down by half every year.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And this has been a smooth progression

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
since the beginning of the genome project.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And halfway through the project, skeptics said,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and you've finished one percent of the project."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But that was really right on schedule.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Because if you double one percent seven more times,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which is exactly what happened,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Communication technologies:

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
50 different ways to measure this,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But this has progressed at an exponential pace.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is deeply democratizing.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
when the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
by this growth of decentralized communication.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to do things like simulate regions of the human brain.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But where will we get the software?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But we are learning more and more about the human brain.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And we're showing that we can actually turn this data

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
into working models and simulations of brain regions.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
simulated and tested:

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
cerebellum, where we do our skill formation;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
slices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And all of this has fueled

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
an increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
We've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
fueled by this information technology.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And we're all concerned about energy and the environment.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well this is a logarithmic graph.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This represents a smooth doubling,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
every two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a form of information technology, to solar panels.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And we're only eight doublings away

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
When I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And we will begin to actually deeply influence

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
our health and our intelligence,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
as we get closer and closer to this technology.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Based on that we are announcing, here at TED,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
in true TED tradition, Singularity University.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It's a new university

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and myself.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It's backed by NASA and Google,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And our goal was to assemble the leaders,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
both teachers and students,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in these exponentially growing information technologies,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and their application.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But Larry Page made an impassioned speech

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
at our organizing meeting,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
saying we should devote this study

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And if we did that, then Google would back this.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And so that's what we've done.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
will be devoted to a group project to address

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
some major challenge of humanity.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Like for example, applying the Internet,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
which is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to bringing health information

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to developing areas of the world.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And these projects will continue past these sessions,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
using collaborative interactive communication.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
All the intellectual property that is created and taught

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
will be online and available,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and developed online in a collaborative fashion.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Here is our founding meeting.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But this is being announced today.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
at the NASA Ames research center.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
There are different programs for graduate students,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
for executives at different companies.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The first six tracks here -- artificial intelligence,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
advanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
are the different core areas of information technology.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Then we are going to apply them to the other areas,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
like energy, ecology,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
policy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
so that people can bring these new technologies to the world.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
from both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
particularly Google and NASA.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
This is an exciting new venture.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
(Applause)
