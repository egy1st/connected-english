00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I have a big impact on the planet

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to travel here by plane.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that is the weight of two elephants.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I came here to speak about ecology,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I emitted as much CO2

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as a Frenchman in one year.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So what do I have to do?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Laughter)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I have to do my carbon offset in another way,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
like I do every time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In fact my work is to show

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
our impact on our planet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going to show you some examples

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of the last pictures I've done

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in the last year.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You know the problem;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we don't want to believe what we know.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In Alberta people work nonstop,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
24 hours by seven

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to extract as much oil

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
as they can.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We know about the end of oil.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But we use three times more oil

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
than we find every year.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We don't want to believe what we know.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Deny.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Coral reef in New Caledonia.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
100 percent of the coral

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
may be wiped out before 2050

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because of global warming.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The thickness of the Arctic

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
decreased more than 40 percent

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
since 1960.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Sad picture.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It lost 80 percent of its ice.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
According to scientists,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in 100 years

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
all the mountain glacier will be gone.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Like Al Gore told you,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
two billion people live on the water

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
from the glacier of Himalaya.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Return of fish men.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
One fifth of human kind

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
depend on fish to live.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Today now 70 percent

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of the fish stock are over-exploited.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
According to FAO,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if we don't change our system of fishing

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We don't want to believe what we know.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
One human of six

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
have not enough to eat in the world.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
One billion people have not enough to eat.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Here in America,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
90 percent of the corn cultivated

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is used to feed animals or to do oil.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Palm tree plantation in Borneo.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Refugee camp in Darfur.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
According to the U.N.,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we speak about 250 million refugees

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in 2050.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I always show my pictures in the street.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But how to understand the world

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
without the voice of people?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Landscape was not enough.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It was obvious to me to do another work.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I sent around the world six cameramen

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
asking the same question,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the same crucial question,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
about life.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We have done five thousand interviews.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm going to show you this.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Woman: You're asking me a hard question.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and speak to the people,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
when we were taking her sons.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I feel ashamed.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I feel humbled

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
by their strength.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I will forever feel a need

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to make reparations to Iraq.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
My family ... What can I say?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
At the moment, my family is very poor,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Thank you.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Thank you for having fed me and raised me,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and for making my life of today. Thank you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I've done more in life being in a chair

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
than out of a chair.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
After many people said I couldn't do that.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I think that comes from connecting with nature,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
connecting with the energy of life,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
spiritually, mentally or physically.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I got the easy part.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
You come from elsewhere.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You don't know me. I don't know you.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
We talk without lying.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and we become friends.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
How can we make it all by ourselves?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Applause)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
YAB: You can also go to the website,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
answer -- respond to the questions also.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Forty crucial questions.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
For the last three years,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I was shooting the earth for the movie.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The name of the movie is "Home" --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
"Maison."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It is about the state of the planet.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
These plants, several hundred million years old.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And we humans have been walking upright

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
for only 200 thousand years.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We've managed to adapt,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and have conquered the whole planet.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
For generations, we've been raising our children,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
For the past 30 years

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
from high up in the sky.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We depend on water,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
forests,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
deserts,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
oceans.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Fishing,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
breeding,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
farming

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
are still the world's foremost human occupations.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And what binds us together

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is far greater than what divides us.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the same wish to rise above ourselves,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and become better.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And yet we carry on raising walls

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
to keep us apart.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Today our greatest battle

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
In less than 50 years

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
we've altered it more thoroughly

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
than in the entire history of mankind.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Half of the world's forests have vanished.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Water resources are running low.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Intensive farming is depleting soils.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Our energy sources are not sustainable.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The climate is changing.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
We are endangering ourselves.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We're only trying to improve our lives.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
We haven't yet understood

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that we're going at a much faster pace

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
than the planet can sustain.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
We know that solutions are available today.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We all have the power to change this trend

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
for the better.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So what are we waiting for?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
(Applause)

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But it is not a normal movie.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The film is going to be distributed free.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This film has no copyright.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
On the five of June,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the environment day,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
everybody can download the movie on Internet.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The film is given for free

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
to the distributor for TV and theater

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to show it the fifth of June.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
There is no business on this movie.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It is also available for school,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
cities, NGOs and you.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
We have to believe what we know.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Let me tell you something.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
It's too late to be pessimistic --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
really too late.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We have all a part of the solutions.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
To finish,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I would like to welcome

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
the 4,700th baby

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
born since the beginning of this talk.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Merci beaucoup. I love you.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000
(Applause)
