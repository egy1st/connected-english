00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
"The Better Man."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I was the better at getting and keeping.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You were the better at spend and spend;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was the better at grubbing and heaping,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But who was the better man in the end?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes, who was the better man, my friend?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You were the better with lords and ladies,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was the better at pillaging Troy;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You were the better at kissing the babies,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I was the better at search and destroy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But who was the better man, old boy?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Who was the better man?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was the better at improvisation,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You were the better at spinning the plates;

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I was the better at procrastination,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You were the better at quiet debate.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But who was the better man, old mate?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Who was the better man?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You were the better at rolling a reefer,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I was the better at coke and rum;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The Maori twins

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with the tattooed bum?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But who was the better man, old chum?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Who was the better man?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now we come down to it, relatives grieving.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Out in the hall with their crocodile tears;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What I've been meaning to tell you for years,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And years, and years, and years, old friend ...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is that you were the better man, in the end;

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You were the better man,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My friend.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
(Applause)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I wrote this next poem for my mother.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Every one of us had a mother,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
only one --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
probably the most important person in your life,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
if you're lucky enough to know them.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
My mother was certainly the most important in mine.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Let me try and describe her to you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
She's 86 years old. She's frail.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
White, platinum hair.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and make those helmets?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
(Laughter)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Looks like a much prettier version

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
of Margaret Thatcher,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But my mother has lived by this creed

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
all her life.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"Never Go Back."

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Never go back. Never go back.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Never return to the haunts of your youth.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Memory holds all you need of the truth.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Never look back. Never look back.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Never succumb to the gorgon's stare.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Never go back. Never go back.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Never surrender the future you earned.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Never return to the bridges you've burned.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Never look back. Never look back.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Never retreat to the 'glorious past.'

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Treat every day of your life as your last.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Never go back. Never go back.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Keep to the track, to the beaten track;

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
No-one is waiting and nothing is there.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Applause)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
were tied end to end along a railroad track,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that would be me,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
stoking the train

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
without a qualm in the world.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Ladies, don't do it.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Don't do it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Stop it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Tell them to go to hell.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You bodies are wonderful as they are.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Just leave them alone.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
"To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Lady lady, do not weep.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Turn your pillow. Dry your tears.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Count thy sheep and not thy years.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Nothing good can come of this.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Time rules all, my dearest.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
'Tis but folly to be waging war

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
On one who never lost before.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Lady, this is all in vain.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Youth can never come again;

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We have drunk the summer wine.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
None can make a stitch in time.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Nip and tuck till crack of doom.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
What is foretold in the womb

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
May not be foresworn with gold.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Nor may time be bought or sold.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Dearest, do I love thee less?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Do I shrink from thy caress?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Think you I could cease to care?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Never was there one so fair!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Lady lady, do not weep --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
What is gone is gone. Now sleep.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Lean against me, calm your fears,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Count thy blessings, not thy years.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Applause)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
ever has, or ever could have done.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Even when on its worst behavior,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I find myself automatically defending the USA

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
playing their Greek card to Roman trumps.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
America is an empire.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I hope you know that now.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
All empires, by definition, are bumbling,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But it seems to be that the USA's sins,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
compared to those of many previous empires,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
are of a more moderate,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
if more pervasive, kind.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Let me put this bluntly.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
If Americans are so fat,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
stupid and ignorant,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
my dear friends from Birmingham,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
how come they rule the world?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
"Hail to the Gods of America."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Hail to the Gods of America!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Hail to the gods of the dream.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Invictus E Pluribus Unum.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But which of them reigns supreme?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Which is America's Jupiter?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The Brahmins of Capital Hill?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
They eye of a dollar bill?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Or is it celebrity status?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The worship of those we hate.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Or the cult of living forever,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
If only we'd watch our weight.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
What of the titans of media?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Or Hollywood's siren call?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
What of the temples of justice,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Whose servants enslave us all?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
What of the Brand and the Label?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
What of the upstart Sport?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And what of the Constitution,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
That bully of last resort?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Hail to the God of America,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Whose power the masses extol --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Convenience rules America;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Convenience owns our soul.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Aye, that it does.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Applause)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And if you would like to know why I am not a father --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the answer is in this poem,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
which upsets me every time I read it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
"Love Came to Visit Me."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Love came to visit me,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
shy as a fawn.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But finding me busy,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
she fled, with the dawn.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
At 20 the torch of resentment was lit.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
My rage at injustice

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
waxed hot as the pits.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The flux of its lava cleared all in its path.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
To lie with a bloody man,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
his terror unfeigned.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
The fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
By guile and by bluster,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
by night and by day,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I battered and scattered the fools from my way.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And women grew willing to sham and to bluff.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
From 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Forgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Grown sick to our stomachs,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and sick of our lives.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Love came to visit me,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
shy as a fawn.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But finding me busy,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
she fled with the dawn.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
(Applause)

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Um, there are --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
in my businesses.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
A complete shock. I was a little ill.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Okay, I was ill.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
That was in October of 2000.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'm not an evil man.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
(Laughter)

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Not with much success.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I love to think what they thought, what it was like.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Because although

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
although you guys can not only go to the moon,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
you know, you're going to totally transform everything.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I don't know. You can do anything you want.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But human nature doesn't change, mate.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
when my ancestor --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
probably it was my ancestor --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and battered the bastard to death.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You think we didn't do that?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Oh, we did.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We killed every single one of them.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Inch by inch we killed them.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
We hunted them down wherever they were.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We're still doing it,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
with all of the genius assembled in this room.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Our natures haven't changed a single iota.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And they never will.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Even when we've got off this little planet,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And I am as bad as you.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I spent eight years

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And at seven o'clock every night,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I took me some more girls, already corrupted.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And I took crack cocaine,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
every single night for seven years.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
It was like Dante's "Inferno."

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It was unbelievable.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
for about four hours.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And you stay up for 12.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It was absolutely unbelievable.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Twenty-two godchildren I've got.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
What do I say to them?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
what would happen to my mother.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
If you're a woman, remember that.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The love of your son

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000
can utterly transform anything he does.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
"Our Lady in White."

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Pale she was, listless;

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And soft to the touch.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
A generous mistress Whom many loved much.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Shoulder to shoulder, Night after night,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We hoarded and sold her --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Our Lady in White.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We breathed but to savor

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
her crystal caress.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We craved but to favor the hem of her dress.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
We dabbled and babbled,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Denying our thirsts.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But always we scrabbled

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to lie with her first.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Absent, we missed her,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
grew haggard and limp.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Toyed with her sister,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
or threatened her pimp.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Came word out of Babel, the lady returns!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And there on the table we took her, in turns.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Sensing the power that tyranny craves,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
There in that hour, she made us her slaves.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Many there were, to covet her kiss.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
My shame as a spur,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I fled the abyss.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But only just.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:06.000
(Applause)
