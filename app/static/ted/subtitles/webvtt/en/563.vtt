00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I used to be a Malthusian.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This was my mental model of the world:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
exploding population, small planet;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's going to lead to ugly things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But I'm moving past Malthus,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because I think that we just might be about 150 years

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
from a kind of new enlightenment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's why.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the U.N.'s population data,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you may have seen, for the world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the world's population expected to top out

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So what then?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So a lot of economists

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
look at declining population

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But a declining population is going to have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
at least two very beneficial economic effects.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
make investing in property a bad bet.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In the cities, a lot of the cost of property

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Take away land speculation,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
price of land drops.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that begins to lift a heavy burden

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
off the world's poor.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Number two: a declining population

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
means scarce labor.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Scarce labor drives wages.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As wages increase

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But look what happened in Europe

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
after the plague:

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
rising wages,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
land reform,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
technological innovation,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
birth of the middle class;

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and after that, forward-looking social movements

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
like the Renaissance,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and later the Enlightenment.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
romanticizing the past.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and descend through a kind of profligate present

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to a very ugly future.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So human history is viewed

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as sort of this downhill slide

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from the good old days.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But I think we're in for another change,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
about two generations after the top of that curve,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
once the effects of a declining population

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
start to settle in.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
instead of the nasty, brutish past.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So why does this matter?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Why talk about social-economic movements

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that may be more than a century away?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Because transitions are dangerous times.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When land owners start to lose money,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and labor demands more pay,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If we have a positive view about the future

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
then we may be able to accelerate through that turn,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
instead of careening off a cliff.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If we can make it through the next 150 years,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I think that your great great grandchildren

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
will forget all about Malthus.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And instead, they'll be planning for the future

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Thank you.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
(Applause)
