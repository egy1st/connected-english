00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's happening to the climate?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It is unbelievably bad.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is likely to be gone at this point

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we all look at what we can do.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
52 percent are tied to buildings.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we ran off to a sushi bar.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And it was something called EcoRock.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
gypsum drywall process that generates

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is exactly what we've done.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We started R&amp;D in 2006.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Decided to use recycled content from cement

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and steel manufacturing.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But our people had to do some 5,000

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We did the line install over the summer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
not made using gypsum at all.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That's the finished production line there.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We got our first panel out on December third.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
equivalent to build one house.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We must change everything.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Look around the room: chairs, wood,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We're going as fast as we can.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you know, CO2 generated. Right?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Those are my kids, Natalie and David.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
When they have their kids, 2050,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
with the team that you had."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So my hope is that when you leave TED,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you will look at reducing your carbon footprint

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in however you can do it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Thank you so much.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Applause)
