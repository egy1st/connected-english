00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a world-changing invention.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of lives, worldwide.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with 350,000 home fires.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What if we could prevent electrical fires

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
before they start?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So how does electricity ignite residential fires?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well it turns out that the main causes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Our invention had to address all of these issues.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what about circuit breakers?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is 130-year-old technology,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and this is a problem, because over 80 percent

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of all home electrical fires

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Hmmm ...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we considered all of this. And we realized

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that electrical appliances

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
must be able to communicate directly

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with the power receptacle itself.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
must be able to tell the power outlet,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Hey, power outlet,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a data tag, in the appliance plug.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so they could communicate.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, every home electrical system

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
becomes an intelligent network.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The appliance's safe operating parameters

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
are embedded into its plug.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If too much current is flowing,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the intelligent receptacle turns itself off,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and prevents another fire from starting.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We call this technology EFCI,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
roughly 2,500 children

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because the power is always off,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, besides saving lives,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
is in its energy savings.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This invention will reduce global energy consumption

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
by allowing remote control and automation

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of every outlet in every home and business.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
by automatically cycling heavy loads

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
like air conditioners and heaters.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
from a central location, or even a cell phone.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There are 10 billion electrical outlets

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in North America alone.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The potential energy savings is very, very significant.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Of those, 186 have been granted:

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
228 are in process.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we received our first international recognition,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the 2009 CES Innovation Award.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, to conclude,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
prevent tens of thousands of injuries,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
every single year,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
while significantly reducing global energy consumption.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(Applause)
