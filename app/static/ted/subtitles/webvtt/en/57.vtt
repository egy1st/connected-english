00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which we will hope to see happen.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that will change the lives of many people.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
At the present time, it takes an average of three hours

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
before that patient arrives at an emergency room.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And people with silent ischemia --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
-- means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that will cause them to have very bad problems later on.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Thus 900,000 people either have died

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or have significant damage to their heart muscle.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because we are very brave. We are very brave,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The means consist of noting something a little technical,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
ST segment elevation of the electrogram --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
translated into English, that means that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which we call the ST segment -- elevates,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that is a sure sign of a heart attack.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we could know, before they even have symptoms,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that they're having a heart attack, to save their life.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that will trigger an emergency alarm,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So we have to try these devices out

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because the FDA won't just let us use them on people

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
unless we try it out first,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and the best model for this happens to be pigs.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
like you see in an emergency room,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, with the pig, at the baseline,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and after three minutes -- well,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if you really studied it, you'd see a difference.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
every layperson could see that difference,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Then, look at that after three minutes.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And it's not hard to see that -- the baseline

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
is the first picture on the upper left.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
then this rise -- that's the ST elevation.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And if we had a computer that could detect it,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And computers don't go to sleep.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We have a little battery and on this little battery

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
What does the system look like?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It's implanted with very conventional techniques.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
so we said, well, we're experts in stents.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We said, so we'll put in a stent,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We're putting in a copper stent,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and let me show you the result that's very gratifying

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
as far as people who have heart disease are concerned.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
coming out by radio telemetry.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
which later we had the pig run around --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I'm not going to go into this early stage.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that kept him from having a heart attack.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Finally, you go to the emergency room.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
They finally see you. It takes more time

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
which the computer we put in you gets.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
but the heart muscle has died.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and show them, and say, take care of me right away.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Then it goes to a network operations center,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
where they get your data from your patient database

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
your signal appears on the screen of a computer

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and the computer analyzes what your problem is.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
this is also a cell phone -- and says,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and we're going to send the signal to the hospital

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and we're going to have it analyzed there,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and there you're going to be with your doctor

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
That's the first invention that I wanted to describe.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Applause)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And now I want to talk about something entirely different.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
because I'd never had a migraine headache,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and their lives are being totally ruined by it.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
by the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
applied, as needed, by the patient."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Now, you're probably very few physicists here.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that's your brains by the way --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
can erase a migraine headache.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
That's what we have discovered.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So here's a picture of what we're doing.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
have a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but it sort of begins with little dancing lights,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And here's one of the patients who has an aura

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
This is what an aura looks like.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What does that mean?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to -- "

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Anchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that literally zaps your migraines away.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
if it could stop a migraine.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
say it is scientifically sound --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
SS: But is it safe to use everyday?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
(Applause)

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
which has something to do with this.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
(Applause)

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The third and last invention began with an idea.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Now, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
have to get into all these technical words.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
which is where the epileptic seizure begins --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we sense there, that it's going to happen,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
which erases the errant signal

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
The device could be implanted under the scalp

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
are a result of some electrical malfunction in it,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We formed a company called NeuroPace

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and we started work on responsive neurostimulation,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and this is a picture of what the device looked like,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
that's placed into the cranial bone.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
This is probably a better picture.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
he marks it around, and uses a dental burr

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And then with four screws, we put in a frame,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
then we snap in the device and we run with wires --

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
where we can sense the electrical signal

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
The comprehensive solution: this is the device;

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
just the thickness of most cranial bones.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation:

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
provide stimulation only when needed,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And this shows what an electroencephalogram is,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
which means they did not get the epileptic seizure.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
(Applause)

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
for the treatment of other brain disorders.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Then you saw what that device looked like,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
that the woman was using to fix her migraines?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
not a real designer of good equipment.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
(Laughter)

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
We want to have some people, who really know how to do this,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
for the portable device for treating migraine headaches.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
where we have problems that Africa doesn't have.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And by reducing malpractice litigation --

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
(Applause)

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
So, to get quickly to my first wish --

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
the brain operates by electrical signals.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
If the electrical signals create a brain disorder,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
we can counteract that.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
like we're doing with epilepsy.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
But even if there is no signal,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And consider treating psychotic disorders --

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
and I want this involved with the TED group --

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
such as obsessive-compulsive disorder

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
That is the first wish.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
(Applause)

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
The second wish is, at the present time,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
appears to be quite successful.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Well, that's the good news.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The present portable device is far from optimally designed,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
both as to human factors as appearance.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
(Laughter)

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Engage a company having prior successes

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
for human factors engineering and industrial design

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And that is the second wish.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
(Applause)

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
to optimize the design of the device for migraines.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
(Applause)

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Well, the third and final wish is somewhat --

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
(Laughter)

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
so that competent physicians are leaving their practice.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
showing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I have a couple of ideas to begin with.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
As a starting point for discussion with the TED group,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
For example, I asked the epilepsy people

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
what are they using for informed consent.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Would you believe, 12 pages, single space,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
They don't understand what the hell it's about.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
(Laughter)

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
That's the present system. How about making a video?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
We have entertainment people here;

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
we have people who know how to do videos,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
that can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
and they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And that is one of the ideas.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Now, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
including all the possible failure modes.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
if one of the known procedure failures occurs.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
and you have it all in the video file,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
will take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
These are just some starting points.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
(Applause)
