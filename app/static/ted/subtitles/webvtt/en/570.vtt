00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is called Hooked on a Feeling:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but a very happy chimp up there.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cannot wish not to be so.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We are wired to pursue happiness,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So given that that's true,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
how good are we at increasing our happiness?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, we certainly try.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the 10 secrets,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now another way we try to increase our happiness

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is we medicate ourselves.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It was clean, efficient, there was no high,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
there was really no danger, it had no street value.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In 1995,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
illegal drugs were a $400 billion business,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
representing eight percent of world trade,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
roughly the same as gas and oil.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
One problem that's happening now is,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
although the rates of happiness

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
are about as flat as the surface of the moon,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
depression and anxiety are rising.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and more people are being found out.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the United States right now

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
there are more suicides than homicides.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
There is a rash of suicide in China.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And the World Health Organization predicts

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the year 2020

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that depression will be

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the second largest cause of disability.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now the good news here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is that if you take surveys from around the world,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we see that about three quarters of people

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
will say they are at least pretty happy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But this does not follow any of the usual trends.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
For example, these two show great growth in income,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
absolutely flat happiness curves.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
My field, the field of psychology,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
hasn't done a whole lot

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that can never be met in reality.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
He said, "One feels inclined to say

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that the intention that man should be happy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is not included in the plan of creation."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
was really what Freud called ordinary misery.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And Freud in part reflects

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the anatomy of the human emotion system --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is that we have both a positive and a negative system,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and our negative system

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is extremely sensitive.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We also find that people are more averse to losing

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
than they are happy to gain.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The formula for a happy marriage

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is five positive remarks, or interactions,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
for every one negative.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And that's how powerful the one negative is.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I also put in here the stress response.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We're wired for dangers that are immediate,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that are physical, that are imminent,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and so our body goes into an incredible reaction

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
where endogenous opioids come in.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We have a system that is really ancient,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and really there for physical danger.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And so over time, this becomes a stress response,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which has enormous effects on the body.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Cortisol floods the brain;

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it destroys hippocampal cells and memory,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and can lead to all kinds of health problems.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But unfortunately, we need this system in part.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
If we were only governed by pleasure

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
we would not survive.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We really have two command posts.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Emotions are short-lived intense responses

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to challenge and to opportunity.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that tune in, turn on, drop out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that change what we remember,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
what kind of decisions we make,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and how we perceive things.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We've come away from the Freudian gloom,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and people are now actively studying this.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And one of the key points in the science of happiness

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
is that happiness and unhappiness

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
are not endpoints of a single continuum.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The Freudian model is really one continuum

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that, as you get less miserable,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
you get happier.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
you get less miserable.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
because there isn't a sense of the other half --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
what are the positive emotions.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And of course we know this intuitively,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that happiness is not just the absence of misery.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
seeing these as two parallel systems.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So that the body can both look for opportunity

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And they're sort of two reciprocal

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and dynamically interacting systems.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
People have also wanted to deconstruct.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We use this word "happy,"

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and it's this very large umbrella of a term.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And then three emotions for which there are no English words:

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
a malicious pleasure;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
are happiness in another's happiness.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We don't seem to have a word for that.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We are very sensitive to the negative,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but it is in part offset by the fact

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that we have a positivity.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We're also born pleasure-seekers.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Babies love the taste of sweet

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and hate the taste of bitter.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They like to look at beautiful faces

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
rather than plain faces.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
They like to listen to consonant melodies

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
instead of dissonant melodies.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Babies really are born

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
with a lot of innate pleasures.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
There was once a statement made by a psychologist

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is really just about the genes,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That's nonsense.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
about 50 percent --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Let's just go into the brain for a moment,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and see where does happiness

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
arise from in evolution.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We have basically at least two systems here,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and they both are very ancient.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
One is the reward system,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and that's fed by the chemical dopamine.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It goes to the nucleus accumbens,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
where decisions are made, high level.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
This was originally seen as a system

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that was the pleasure system of the brain.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In the 1950s,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So they assumed

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It turned out that it wasn't,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that it really is a system of motivation,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
a system of wanting.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It gives objects what's called incentive salience.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It makes something look so attractive

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that you just have to go after it.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
That's something different

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
from the system that is the pleasure system,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
which simply says, "I like this."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The pleasure system, as you see,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is widely spread throughout the brain.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Dopamine system, the wanting system,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is much more centralized.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And we see here the smile.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to the zygomatic major.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the orbicularis oculi.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
will show this particular kind of smile.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Extroverts use it more than introverts.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
People who are relieved of depression

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
show it more after than before.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
you will look for this expression.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Our pleasures are really ancient.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that we have a response to the natural world

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that's very profound.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Very interesting studies

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
done on people recovering from surgery,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
who found that people who faced a brick wall

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
versus people who looked out on trees and nature,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the people who looked out on the brick wall

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
were in the hospital longer, needed more medication,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and had more medical complications.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
There is something very restorative about nature,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and it's part of how we are tuned.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Humans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Here is a three-week-old baby.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
the baby will do the same.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We are social beings from the beginning.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And even studies of cooperation

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
show that cooperation between individuals

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
lights up reward centers of the brain.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
One problem that psychology has had

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
or the importance of the social brain

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to humans who come into the world helpless

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and need each other tremendously --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
is that they focus instead on the self

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and self-esteem, and not self-other.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's sort of "me," not "we."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that goes against our biology and nature,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and hasn't made us any happier at all.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
when they're absorbed in something out in the world,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
when they're with other people, when they're active,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
learning, having sex, whatever.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
They're not sitting in front of the mirror

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
trying to figure themselves out,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
or thinking about themselves.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is if you look at computerized text analysis

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of people who commit suicide,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what you find there, and it's quite interesting,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
is use of the first person singular --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
"I," "me," "my,"

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
not "we" and "us" --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and the letters are less hopeless

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
than they are really alone.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
There is a profound need to belong.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
they care that we replicate,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that we pass our genes on.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So for example we have three systems

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Romantic attraction,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
that gets into the desire system.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
There's attachment, which is oxytocin,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So a person can be in a long term attachment,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
become romantically infatuated with someone else,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and want to have sex with a third person.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
is in social status.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
We are very acutely aware of our social status

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and always seek to further and increase it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and that's dominance.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I seize command by physical prowess,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and I keep it by beating my chest,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and you make submissive gestures.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and that is a prestige route,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
which is freely conferred.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and we give that person status.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
as they are in the animal world.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But it's not irrelevant.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
You see mental distress going up with lower income.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So clearly there is some effect.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But the effect is relatively small.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And one of the problems with money is materialism.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
What happens when people pursue money too avidly,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So we have here, this couple.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So one of the things is that it really takes over.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
That whole dopamine-wanting system

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that as people rise above their biological needs,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
as the world becomes safer

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
our biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
we can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
toward self-actualization or transcendence,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and rise above the materialist.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So to just quickly conclude with some brief data

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that suggests this might be so.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
they felt their life and their whole values had changed.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
before the change,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and much more post-materialist values after.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to generosity and forgiveness.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I end with a few quotes.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"There is only one question:

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
How to love this world?"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
do not blame it; blame yourself.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Tell yourself that you are not poet enough

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
to call forth its riches."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
"First, say to yourself what you would be.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Then do what you have to do."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Thank you.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
(Applause)
