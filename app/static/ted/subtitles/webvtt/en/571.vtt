00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me share with you today an original discovery.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to something I'm calling biomutualism.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, in terms of biomimetics,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
nature becomes a much more useful teacher.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Engineering can be inspired by biology

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but then integrating that with the best human engineering,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
ultimately to make something actually better than nature.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
These are gecko toes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to climb up a wall so quickly.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We discovered it. And what we found was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
van der Waals forces.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I'm really pleased to report to you today

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
From the simplest version in nature, one branch,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
had made the first synthetic version.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And so has my other incredible collaborator,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
he made much larger hairs than the gecko,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but used the same general principles.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And here is its first test.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
professor now at Lewis and Clark,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
literally giving his first-born child up for this test.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
More recently, this happened.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Man: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Narrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who appeared to be brimming with confidence.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Lynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Man: How do you know?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Narrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of Hollywood and science.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Man: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Robert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And you can try this in the lobby,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and look at the gecko-inspired material.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now the problem with the robots doing this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is that they can't get unstuck,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with the material.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from the surface, at high rates,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as they run up the wall.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Well I'm really excited today to show you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the newest version of a robot, Stickybot,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Here is the actual robot.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And here is what it does.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And if you look,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you can see that it uses

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the toe peeling,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
just like the gecko does.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Applause)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There it is.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that the Stanford group was able to do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in designing this incredible robot.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Applause)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
this kind of thing happens.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The engineers told us, for the climbing robots,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that, if they don't have a tail,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
they fall off the wall.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So what they did was they asked us

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
an important question.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Even though we put a passive bar there.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
What they were doing was returning the favor,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
by giving us a hypothesis to test,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So of course, in reality, we were then panicked,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
being the biologists, and we should know this already.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We know that you can grab onto things with them.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And perhaps it is most well known

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that they provide static balance.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It can also act as a counterbalance.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So watch this kangaroo.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
See that tail? That's incredible!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And it was unstable without its tail.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
like this human inside this dinosaur suit.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and running them through and obstacle course,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and found a decrement in performance,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
like you'd predict.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But of course, this is a passive tail.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you can also have active tails.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And when I went back to research this, I realized

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that one of the great TED moments in the past,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
from Nathan,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we've talked about an active tail.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Video: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
were interested in love, not war.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It can also be used in defense.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Pretty powerful.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So we then went back and looked at the animal.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And we ran it up a surface.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that you see in yellow there.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So here is normal speed.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And watch it now slip,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and see what it does with its tail.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and it contributes to stability.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is incredible.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The engineers had a really good idea.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And then of course we wondered,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and there was some wind, or we shook it?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And we did that experiment, that you see here.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
(Applause)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And this is what we discovered.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But there it is slowed down.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
righting response. But it's like a cat.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But geckos do it better.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And they do it with their tail.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So for TED we actually built a robot,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
over there, a prototype, with the tail.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
in a tail, with a robot.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
If we could have the lights on it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Okay, there it goes.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And show the video.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There it is.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And it works just like it does in the animal.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Applause)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, of course, we were normally frightened

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because the animal has no gliding adaptations,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
(Laughter)

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So we did. And here is what it does.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
when you take a picture of it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So we can maneuver this way.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
it also does this. Watch this.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It can actually swim through the air.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and trying to control a glide.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Stay tuned for that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Laughter)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And it certainly looks like it.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You can see it even better from down on top.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Watch the animal.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Definitely moving towards the landing target.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's unbelievable.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So now we were really confused,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
because there are no reports of it gliding.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and see if it actually does this."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Look at the end to see the animal.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But then as it gets closer to the tree,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It actually uses its tail too,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
just like we saw in the lab.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So now we can continue this mutualism

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
by suggesting that they can make an active tail.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And here is the first active tail, in the robot,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
made by Boston Dynamics.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we must preserve nature's designs,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And from what I heard from our new president,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I'm very optimistic. Thank you.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(Applause)
