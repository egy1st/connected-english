WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have had the distinct pleasure

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of living inside two biospheres.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what did I learn? Well,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then of course I have to milk the goats

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because I pick up the phone and I call and say,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So Biosphere 2

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
was essentially a three-acre,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
entirely sealed, miniature world

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
essentially entirely sealed.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So we had our own miniature rainforest,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a private beach with a coral reef.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I mean, what is a biosphere?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And so we decided that what it really is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is that it is entirely materially closed --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and energetically open,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which is essentially what planet Earth is.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that we called our Test Module.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
walked in, to spend a couple of days in there

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to hopefully keep him alive,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the doctors were incredibly concerned

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But of course none of that happened.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And over the ensuing few years,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But by 1991

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we finally had this thing built.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And it was time for us to go in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and give it a go.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We needed to know,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is life this malleable?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Can you take this biosphere,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that has evolved on a planetary scale,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and jam it into a little bottle,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and will it survive?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Big questions.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the Earth that we all live in.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and try out this baby.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Will it work? Or will something happen

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that we can't understand and we can't fix,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So eight of us went in: four men and four women.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
More on that later.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And this is the world that we lived in.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So, on the top, we had

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
these beautiful rainforests and an ocean,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which is where all the pumps and the valves

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
on top of an aircraft carrier."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then also we had the human habitat of course,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
with the laboratories, and all of that.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is the agriculture.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It was essentially an organic farm.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The day I walked into Biosphere 2,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I was, for the first time,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
breathing a completely different atmosphere

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
than everybody else in the world,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
except seven other people.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I mean it rather literally.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When I breathed out, my CO2

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
(Laughter)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And those sweet potatoes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
became part of me.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I became orange with sweet potato.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
When it came to our atmosphere, however,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And we knew that we were losing CO2.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And so we were working to sequester carbon.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Good lord -- we know that term now.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We were growing plants like crazy.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
growing plants, going around, around, around,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But our oxygen was going down faster

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And we had no clue where it was.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and our oxygen went down quite far;

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
my goodness, do you feel dreadful.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And we had sleep apnea at night.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So you'd wake up gasping with breath,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because your blood chemistry has changed.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And everybody outside thought we were dying.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to make sure we were, in fact, fine.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And you might think, well,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
"Boy, your life support system

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
at any time, if it really got bad,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Not me, that was for sure.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because we could really crank this baby up,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
as a scientific tool,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and see if we could, in fact, find

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And we did indeed find it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And we found it in the concrete.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Essentially it had done something very simple.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Pretty straightforward really.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So at the end of the two years

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
when we came out, we were elated,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
because, in fact, although you might say

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
we had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
when your oxygen is going down,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
stopped working, essentially, in your life support system,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that's a very bad failure.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And nothing else emerged

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that really was as serious as that.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And we proved the concept, more or less.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
People, on the other hand, was a different subject.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We all went quite nuts, I will say.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And the day I came out of Biosphere 2,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And everybody ran up to me.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And I recoiled. They stank!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
People stink!

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and all kinds of stuff.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but nothing with perfume.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And boy do we stink out here.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Not only that,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
but I lost touch of where my food came from.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I had been growing all my own food.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
reading all the names on all of the things.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
People must have thought I was nuts.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It was really quite astonishing.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And I slowly lost track

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and it had an impact on me,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
very viscerally, very literally.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So I went about my business:

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Paragon Space Development Corporation,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because I had nothing else to do.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And one of the things we did was

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and what can you do with them?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
for 16 months, where we managed to produce

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the first organisms to go through

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
complete multiple life cycles in space --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
really pushing the envelope

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
of understanding how malleable

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
our life systems are.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And I'm also proud to announce

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that we're actually forming a team

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
which is going to be pretty fun.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And part of that is that we had to model

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
very rapid circulation of CO2

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and oxygen and water through this plant system.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
As a result of that modeling

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I ended up in all places,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
incredibly stark, and I have no understanding

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of how people eke out a living there.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It is so dry.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
This is what I saw.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But this is also what I saw.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I saw a company that had

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
taken seawater

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and sand, and they were growing

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And it will produce a food crop.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
In this case it was oilseed.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in a plantation.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And the mangroves were providing wood

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and honey and leaves for the animals,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
so that they could produce milk and whatnot,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
like we had in the Biosphere.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
frankly, from an environmental point of view.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And what this project was doing

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
was taking the effluent of these,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and turning them into all of this food.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Kyoto Protocol system.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I know where to draw the boundary.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And put your project in that context.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
from what I would call a biocidal species,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This is in fact, this beautiful photograph,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
is in fact over the Amazon.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And those beautiful wispy clouds

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
We're in the process of transforming from this,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
to what I would call a biophilic society,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
one where we learn to nurture society.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It is happening all across the world,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in every kind of walk of life,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and every kind of career

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and industry that you can think of.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I think often times people get lost in that.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's such a huge subject."

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This was my backyard,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
very early on, when I bought my property.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and I want to throttle them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
It's a certain type of aesthetic.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And I threw away my rake.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And over time, essentially what have I been doing?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I've been building topsoil.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And I have an oasis.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This is actually in a riparian area.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And all of Tucson could be like this

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The small stuff counts.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
has given us this, the ability to light up the world.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It has also given us this,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the ability to look at the world from the outside.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Now we may not all have

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
another biosphere that we can run to,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and compare it to this biosphere.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But we can look at the world,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and try to understand where we are in its context,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and how we choose to interact with it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And if you lose where you are in your biosphere,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
with where you are in the biosphere,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I would say to you,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
take a deep breath.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The yogis had it right.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Breath does, in fact, connect us all

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
in a very literal way.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Take a breath now.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And as you breathe, think

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
about what is in your breath.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
from some algae on the beach not far from here.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It also connects us in time.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
There may be some carbon in your breath

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
from the dinosaurs.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that will be in the breath

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
of your great-great-great-grandchildren.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Thank you. (Applause)
