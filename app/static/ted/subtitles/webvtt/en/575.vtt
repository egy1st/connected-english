00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to anywhere in the world.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about that transformation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You probably read something about it in the papers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there might be voter suppression.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And so a plan came up to video the vote.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the idea was that individual citizens

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with phones capable of taking photos or making video

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
would document their polling places,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and would upload this to a central place.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What matters here

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
isn't technical capital,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
it's social capital.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
These tools don't get socially interesting

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
until they get technologically boring.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that their uses start permeating society.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Because now that media is increasingly social,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
innovation can happen anywhere

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And so we're starting to see a media landscape

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in which innovation is happening everywhere,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and moving from one spot to another.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That is a huge transformation.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the moment our historical generation is living through --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is the largest increase in expressive capability

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in human history.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
There are only four periods in the last 500 years

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The first one is the famous one, the printing press:

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that made printing possible

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then, a couple of hundred years ago,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
there was innovation in two-way communication,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Slow, text-based conversations,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
then real-time voice based conversations.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Then, about 150 years ago,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
first photos, then recorded sound,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is what those of us of a certain age

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
grew up with, and are used to.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But there is a curious asymmetry here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The media that is good at creating conversations

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
is no good at creating groups.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And the media that's good at creating groups

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is no good at creating conversations.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If you want to have a conversation

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
in this world, you have it with one other person.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you want to address a group, you get the same message

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and you give it to everybody in the group,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That was the media landscape

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
as we had it in the twentieth century.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And this is what changed.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
He traces the edges of the individual networks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and then color codes them.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The Internet is the first medium in history

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that has native support for groups

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and conversation at the same time.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and television, radio, magazines, books,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
gave us the one-to-many pattern,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
For the first time,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's one of the big changes.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The second big change

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is that, as all media gets digitized,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
for all other media,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And that means that every medium

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is right next door to every other medium.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Put another way,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
media is increasingly less just a source of information,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
can now gather around and talk to each other as well.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And the third big change

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
can now also be producers and not consumers.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Every time a new consumer

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
joins this media landscape

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
a new producer joins as well,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
because the same equipment --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
phones, computers --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
let you consume and produce.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
if you pressed the right buttons.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That is a huge change

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in the media landscape we're used to.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We've had the Internet in its public form

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
for almost 20 years now,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and it's still changing

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
as the media becomes more social.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It's still changing patterns

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Second story.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Last May, China in the Sichuan province

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They were taking videos of buildings shaking.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
They were Twittering it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And so as the quake was happening

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the news was reported.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And because of the social connections,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Twitter announced the existence of the quake

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
several minutes before the US Geological Survey

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
had anything up online for anybody to read.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
it took them three months to admit that it had happened.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
(Laughter)

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Now they might have liked to have done that here,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
rather than seeing these pictures go up online.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
But they weren't given that choice,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because their own citizens beat them to the punch.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
For a while there

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the global short messaging service --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
People collating information,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
pointing people to news sources,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
pointing people to the US geological survey.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And within half a day donation sites were up,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and donations were pouring in from all around the world.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This was an incredible, coordinated global response.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
decided that they were going to let it go,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And then this happened.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the reason so many school buildings collapsed

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
is that corrupt officials had taken bribes

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
to allow those building to be built to less than code.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And so they started, the citizen journalists started

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
in front of these protesters,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in order to get them to go away.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
just please stop protesting in public."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But these are people who have been radicalized,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
because, thanks to the one child policy,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
they have lost everyone in their next generation.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Someone who has seen the death of a single child

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
now has nothing to lose.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And so the protest kept going.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And finally the Chinese cracked down.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
That was enough of citizen media.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And so they began to arrest the protesters.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
China is probably the most successful

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
manager of Internet censorship in the world,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And the Great Firewall of China

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is a set of observation points

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that assume that media is produced by professionals,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
it mostly comes in from the outside world,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
it comes in relatively sparse chunks,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and it comes in relatively slowly.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And because of those four characteristics

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But like the Maginot Line,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
for this challenge,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
because not one of those four things was true in this environment.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
has quite successfully filtered the web,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is now in the position of having to decide

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
whether to allow or shut down entire services,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because the transformation to amateur media

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And in fact that is happening this week.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
they just, two days ago, announced

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
because there was no way to filter it other than that.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They had to turn the spigot entirely off.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
They also affect people who want to send messages,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
not just a particular strategy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
The classic media problem, from the 20th century

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
is, how does an organization have a message

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that they want to get out

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And here is the twentieth century answer.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
National message. Targeted individuals.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Relatively sparse number of producers.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Very expensive to do,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
so there is not a lot of competition.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
This is how you reach people.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
All of that is over.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
social, ubiquitous and cheap.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
are now used to this change.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The audience can talk back.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The really crazy change is here:

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the fact that former consumers are now producers,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and because the size of the network,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
the complexity of the network is actually the square

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of the number of participants,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
meaning that the network, when it grows large,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
grows very, very large.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
As recently at last decade,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
most of the media that was available for public consumption

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
was produced by professionals.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Those days are over, never to return.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
which brings me to my last story.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We saw some of the most imaginative use

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
of social media during the Obama campaign.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I mean most imaginative use ever.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and to try and figure out how to help.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
An incredible conversation sprung up there.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And then, this time last year,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
on American persons.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I'm going to vote for this bill."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And many of his own supporters

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
on his own site went very publicly berserk.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
"Please get FISA right."

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Within days of this group being created

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Obama had to issue a press release.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
He had to issue a reply.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I understand where you are coming from.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
People in that group realized

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that Obama had never shut them down.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
or make it harder to join,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to deny its existence, to delete it,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to take to off the site.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They had understood that their role

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
with myBO.com was to convene their supporters

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
but not to control their supporters.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And that is the kind of discipline

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that it takes to make really mature use

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
of this media.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Media, the media landscape that we knew,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
messages to amateurs,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
is increasingly slipping away.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
in a world of media where the former audience

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
are now increasingly full participants,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in that world, media is less and less often

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
about crafting a single message

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to be consumed by individuals.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It is more and more often

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
a way of creating an environment for convening

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and supporting groups.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And the choice we face,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
anywhere in the world,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That's the media environment we've got.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The question we all face now is,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
"How can we make best use of this media?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Even though it means changing the way we've always done it."

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
(Applause)
