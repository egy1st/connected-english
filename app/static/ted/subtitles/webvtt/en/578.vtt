00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My journey to coming here today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
started in 1974.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's me with the funny gloves.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with me, were Moonies.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And within a week

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I had come to believe

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that the second coming of Christ had occurred,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that it was Sun Myung Moon,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to be his disciple.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now as cool as that sounds,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
my family was not that thrilled with this.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There was an underground railroad of sorts

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They were called deprogrammers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And after about five long years

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
my family had me deprogrammed.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And I then became a deprogrammer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I started going out on cases.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And after about five years of doing this,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I was arrested for kidnapping.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Most of the cases I went out on

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
were called involuntary.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What happened was that the family

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And so they took them to some safe place.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so after this happened,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And about 20 years went by.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There was a burning question though that would not leave me.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Because something did.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
about this decade of my life.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And toward the end of writing that book

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
there was a documentary that came out.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It was on Jonestown.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And it had a chilling effect on me.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
These are the dead in Jonestown.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
About 900 people died that day,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
most of them taking their own lives.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Women gave poison to their babies,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The top picture is a group of Moonies

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that have been blessed by their messiah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Their mates were chosen for them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The thing I had to admit to myself,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
with great repulsion,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
was that I get it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I understand how this could happen.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I understand how someone's brain,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
how someone's mind can come to the place

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
where it makes sense --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
not to try to save the world through genocide.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And so what is this? How does this work?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And how I've come to view what happened to me

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is a viral, memetic infection.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a meme has been defined as

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
an idea that replicates in the human brain

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and moves from brain to brain like a virus,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
much like a virus. The way a virus works is --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
it can infect and do the most damage to someone

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
who has a compromised immune system.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In 1974, I was young, I was naive,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I was pretty lost in my world.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I was really idealistic.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
when you are emotionally vulnerable.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
What happens is that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
circular logic takes over.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
"Moon is one with God.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
God is going to fix all the problems in the world.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
All I have to do is humbly follow.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Because God is going to stop war and hunger --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
all these things I wanted to do --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
all I have to do is humbly follow.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It becomes impenetrable.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And the most dangerous part of this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is that is creates "us" and "them,"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"right" and "wrong,"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
"good" and "evil."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And it makes anything possible,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
makes anything rationalizable.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And the thing is, though,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
if you looked at my brain

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
during those years in the Moonies --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
neuroscience is expanding exponentially,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We're beginning to look inside the brain.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
a viral memetic infection like this,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and compared it to anyone in this room,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I am convinced it would look very, very different.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And that, strange as it may sound,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
gives me hope.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And the reason that gives me hope

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
is that the first thing is to admit

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that we have a problem.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And so this is something that, through research and education,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I believe that we can solve.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And so the first step is to realize

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that we can do this together,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and that there is no "us" and "them."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
