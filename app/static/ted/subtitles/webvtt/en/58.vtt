WEBVTT

00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:06.976
I got to see the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:10.103
I was in India this past year,

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:14.014
and I may have seen
the last cases of polio in the world.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.416
There's nothing that makes
you feel more --

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.983
the blessing and the honor
of working in a program like that --

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.051
than to know that something
that horrible no longer exists.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.728
So I'm going to tell you --

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:31.457
(Applause)

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.886
so I'm going to show you
some dirty pictures.

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:40.664
They are difficult to watch,
but you should look at them with optimism,

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:45.759
because the horror
of these pictures will be matched

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:49.855
by the uplifting quality of knowing
that they no longer exist.

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.661
But first, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about my own journey.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.740
My background is not exactly
the conventional medical education

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:00.000
that you might expect.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.139
When I was an intern in San Francisco,

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:09.975
I heard about a group of Native Americans
who had taken over Alcatraz Island,

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.976
and a Native American
who wanted to give birth on that island,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.141
and no other doctor wanted
to go and help her give birth.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.762
I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived
on the island for several weeks.

00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:24.309
She gave birth; I caught
the baby; I got off the island;

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.189
I landed in San Francisco;

00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:28.101
and all the press wanted to talk to me,

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:32.226
because my three weeks on the island
made me an expert in Indian affairs.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.254
(Laughter)

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:35.317
I wound up on every television show.

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.453
Someone saw me on television;
they called me up; and they asked me

00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:41.082
if I'd like to be in a movie
and to play a young doctor

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:44.256
for a bunch of rock and roll stars
who were traveling in a bus ride

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.354
from San Francisco to England.

00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:47.976
And I said, yes, I would do that,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.256
so I became the doctor
in an absolutely awful movie

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.178
called "Medicine Ball Caravan."

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:55.248
(Laughter)

00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:56.744
Now, you know from the '60s,

00:01:56.768 --> 00:01:59.845
you're either on the bus
or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.866
My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.570
Our bus ride took us
from San Francisco to London,

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:07.793
then we switched buses at the big pond.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:11.245
We then got on two more buses

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.341
and we drove through Turkey
and Iran, Afghanistan,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:17.976
over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,
like every other young doctor.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.667
This is us at the Khyber Pass,
and that's our bus.

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.346
We had some difficulty getting
over the Khyber Pass.

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.000
But we wound up in India.

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:28.714
And then, like everyone else
in our generation,

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:31.023
we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:33.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.231
This is just like a residency program,

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.411
for those of you
that are in medical school.

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:40.068
(Laughter)

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:45.292
And we studied with a wise man,
a guru named Karoli Baba,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:48.958
who then told me to get rid of the dress,

00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:50.725
put on a three-piece suit,

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.003
go join the United Nations as a diplomat

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:56.087
and work for the World
Health Organization.

00:02:56.111 --> 00:03:00.479
And he made an outrageous prediction
that smallpox would be eradicated,

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.525
and that this was God's gift to humanity,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.054
because of the hard work
of dedicated scientists.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.664
And that prediction came true.

00:03:09.504 --> 00:03:11.814
This little girl is Rahima Banu,

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:14.803
and she was the last case
of killer smallpox in the world.

00:03:15.232 --> 00:03:20.208
And this document is the certificate
that the global commission signed,

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:25.000
certifying the world to have eradicated
the first disease in history.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:31.976
The key to eradicating smallpox
was early detection, early response.

00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:36.668
I'm going to ask you to repeat that:
early detection, early response.

00:03:36.692 --> 00:03:37.844
Can you say that?

00:03:37.868 --> 00:03:40.290
Audience: Early detection, early response.

00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:43.871
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox
was the worst disease in history.

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:46.413
It killed more people
than all the wars in history.

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:51.000
In the last century,
it killed 500 million people.

00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:54.849
You're reading about Larry Page already.

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:56.445
Somebody reads very fast.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.023
(Laughter)

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:00.221
In the year that Larry Page
and Sergey Brin --

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.861
with whom I have a certain affection
and a new affiliation --

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:06.065
in the year in which they were born,

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.210
two million people died of smallpox.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.654
We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.056
This is the most important slide
that I've ever seen in public health,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.564
[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]
because it shows you

00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:21.459
to be the richest and the strongest,

00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:23.408
and to be kings and queens of the world,

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:25.506
did not protect you
from dying of smallpox.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.342
Never can you doubt
that we are all in this together.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.379
But to see smallpox
from the perspective of a sovereign

00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:35.903
is the wrong perspective.

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:38.976
You should see it
from the perspective of a mother,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.817
watching her child develop
this disease and standing by helplessly.

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:48.572
Day one, day two, day three,

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:54.201
day four, day five, day six.

00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.614
You're a mother and you're
watching your child,

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:02.614
and on day six, you see
pustules that become hard.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.124
Day seven, they show the classic scars
of smallpox umbilication.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.458
Day eight.

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:11.210
And Al Gore said earlier

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:14.123
that the most photographed
image in the world,

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.894
the most printed image in the world,

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:17.078
was that of the Earth.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:20.713
But this was in 1974,
and as of that moment,

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.360
this photograph was the photograph
that was the most widely printed,

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:27.869
because we printed two billion copies
of this photograph,

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:31.047
and we took them
hand to hand, door to door,

00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:35.952
to show people and ask them
if there was smallpox in their house,

00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:38.082
because that was our surveillance system.

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:40.661
We didn't have Google,
we didn't have web crawlers,

00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:42.415
we didn't have computers.

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:47.724
By day nine -- you look at this picture
and you're horrified;

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.281
I look at this picture
and I say, "Thank God,"

00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:54.266
because it's clear that this is only
an ordinary case of smallpox,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.281
and I know this child will live.

00:05:57.487 --> 00:06:02.830
And by day 13, the lesions
are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,

00:06:02.854 --> 00:06:06.683
but you know this child has
no other secondary infection.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:11.381
And by day 20, while he will be
scarred for life, he will live.

00:06:12.175 --> 00:06:15.224
There are other kinds of smallpox
that are not like that.

00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:17.636
This is confluent smallpox,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.445
in which there isn't a single place
on the body where you could put a finger

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.278
and not be covered by lesions.

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:28.588
Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent
of people who got it.

00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:31.581
And hemorrhagic smallpox,
the most cruel of all,

00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:34.873
which had a predilection
for pregnant women.

00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:36.864
I've probably had 50 women die.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.412
They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.

00:06:39.436 --> 00:06:42.760
I've never seen anybody die from it
who wasn't a pregnant woman.

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:47.379
In 1967, the WHO embarked
on what was an outrageous program

00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:48.887
to eradicate a disease.

00:06:49.204 --> 00:06:52.776
In that year, there were 34 countries
affected with smallpox.

00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:56.269
By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:59.460
1974, we were down to five countries.

00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:04.162
But in that year,
smallpox exploded throughout India.

00:07:05.154 --> 00:07:08.976
And India was the place
where smallpox made its last stand.

00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:12.587
In 1974, India had
a population of 600 million.

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:15.629
There are 21 linguistic states in India,

00:07:15.653 --> 00:07:17.845
which is like saying
21 different countries.

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:21.139
There are 20 million people
on the road at any time,

00:07:21.163 --> 00:07:27.182
in buses and trains, walking;
500,000 villages, 120 million households,

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:29.510
and none of them wanted to report

00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:31.976
if they had a case
of smallpox in their house,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.364
because they thought that smallpox
was the visitation of a deity,

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.411
Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,

00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:41.611
and it was wrong to bring
strangers into your house

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:43.382
when the deity was in the house.

00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.297
No incentive to report smallpox.

00:07:46.686 --> 00:07:49.291
It wasn't just India
that had smallpox deities;

00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:52.579
smallpox deities were
prevalent all over the world.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.412
So, how we eradicated smallpox was --

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:58.710
mass vaccination wouldn't work.

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:00.637
You could vaccinate everybody in India,

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:03.161
but one year later there'd be
21 million new babies,

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:05.280
which was then the population of Canada.

00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:07.881
It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:10.976
You had to find every single
case of smallpox in the world

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.976
at the same time, and draw
a circle of immunity around it.

00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:16.000
And that's what we did.

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:22.510
In India alone, my 150,000 best friends
and I went door to door,

00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:24.608
with that same picture,

00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:26.203
to every single house in India.

00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:28.103
We made over one billion house calls.

00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.057
And in the process,
I learned something very important.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:38.021
Every time we did a house-to-house search,

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:42.769
we had a spike in the number
of reports of smallpox.

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:47.928
When we didn't search, we had
the illusion that there was no disease.

00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:52.156
When we did search, we had the illusion
that there was more disease.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.419
A surveillance system was necessary,

00:08:54.443 --> 00:09:00.420
because what we needed
was early detection, early response.

00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:03.921
So we searched and we searched,

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:06.795
and we found every case
of smallpox in India.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.780
We had a reward. We raised the reward.

00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:11.860
We continued to increase the reward.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.697
We had a scorecard
that we wrote on every house.

00:09:15.426 --> 00:09:17.157
And as we did that,

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:20.557
the number of reported cases
in the world dropped to zero.

00:09:21.963 --> 00:09:26.643
And in 1980, we declared the globe
free of smallpox.

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:31.172
It was the largest campaign
in United Nations history,

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.806
until the Iraq war.

00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:36.976
150,000 people from all over the world --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.916
doctors of every race,
religion, culture and nation,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.835
who fought side by side,
brothers and sisters,

00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:48.097
with each other, not against each other,

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.343
in a common cause
to make the world better.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:55.044
But smallpox was the fourth disease
that was intended for eradication.

00:09:55.068 --> 00:09:57.321
We failed three other times.

00:09:57.345 --> 00:10:00.624
We failed against malaria,
yellow fever and yaws.

00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:03.976
But soon we may see polio eradicated.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.737
But the key to eradicating polio
is early detection, early response.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.459
This may be the year we eradicate polio.

00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:16.173
That will make it
the second disease in history.

00:10:16.197 --> 00:10:20.336
And David Heymann, who's watching
this on the webcast --

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.320
David, keep on going. We're close!

00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:24.976
We're down to four countries.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.407
(Applause)

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:32.646
I feel like Hank Aaron.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.673
Barry Bonds can replace me any time.

00:10:34.697 --> 00:10:38.831
Let's get another disease off the list
of terrible things to worry about.

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:43.064
I was just in India working on
the polio program.

00:10:43.088 --> 00:10:48.851
The polio surveillance program
is four million people going door to door.

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:50.976
That is the surveillance system.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.126
But we need to have
early detection, early response.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.777
Blindness, the same thing.

00:10:56.801 --> 00:11:01.753
The key to discovering blindness
is doing epidemiological surveys

00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:03.976
and finding out the causes of blindness,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.658
so you can mount the correct response.

00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:11.874
The Seva Foundation
was started by a group of alumni

00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:14.790
of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,

00:11:14.814 --> 00:11:17.505
who, having climbed the highest mountain,

00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:21.976
tasted the elixir of the success
of eradicating a disease,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.976
wanted to do it again.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.868
And over the last 27 years,
Seva's programs in 15 countries

00:11:28.892 --> 00:11:31.976
have given back sight
to more than two million blind people.

00:11:32.982 --> 00:11:36.113
Seva got started because we wanted
to apply these lessons

00:11:36.137 --> 00:11:38.732
of surveillance and epidemiology

00:11:38.756 --> 00:11:42.681
to something which nobody else
was looking at as a public health issue:

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:46.691
blindness, which heretofore had been
thought of only as a clinical disease.

00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:54.106
In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me
that computer, which is Apple number 12,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.583
and it's still in Kathmandu,
and it's still working,

00:11:56.607 --> 00:12:00.452
and we ought to go get it and auction
it off and make more money for Seva.

00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:05.250
And we conducted the first Nepal survey
ever done for health,

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:08.131
and the first nationwide
blindness survey ever done,

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:09.976
and we had astonishing results.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:13.273
Instead of finding out
what we thought was the case --

00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:16.976
that blindness was caused mostly
by glaucoma and trachoma --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.464
we were astounded to find out

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:23.163
that blindness was caused
instead by cataract.

00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:28.219
You can't cure or prevent
what you don't know is there.

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:34.341
In your TED packages
there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,"

00:12:34.365 --> 00:12:36.976
about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.032
I hope that you will take a look at it.

00:12:39.056 --> 00:12:41.230
Aravind, which started as a Seva project,

00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:44.202
is now the world's largest
and best eye hospital.

00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:47.623
This year, that one hospital
will give back sight

00:12:47.647 --> 00:12:51.198
to more than 300,000 people
in Tamil Nadu, India.

00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:55.496
(Applause)

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.672
Bird flu.

00:12:56.696 --> 00:12:59.517
I stand here as a representative
of all terrible things --

00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:01.000
this might be the worst.

00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:06.545
The key to preventing
or mitigating pandemic bird flu

00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.976
is early detection and rapid response.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.803
We will not have a vaccine
or adequate supplies of an antiviral

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.976
to combat bird flu if it occurs
in the next three years.

00:13:18.342 --> 00:13:21.976
WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:26.739
We are now at stage three
on the pandemic alert stage,

00:13:26.763 --> 00:13:30.318
with just a little bit
of human-to-human transmission,

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:33.976
but no human-to-human-to-human
sustained transmission.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.228
The moment WHO says
we've moved to category four --

00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:40.415
this will not be like Katrina.

00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:42.518
The world as we know it will stop.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:44.284
There'll be no airplanes flying.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.149
Would you get in an airplane
with 250 people you didn't know,

00:13:48.173 --> 00:13:49.325
coughing and sneezing,

00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:52.842
when you knew that some of them
might carry a disease that could kill you,

00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:55.746
for which you had
no antivirals or vaccine?

00:13:56.877 --> 00:14:00.894
I did a study of the top epidemiologists
in the world in October.

00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:04.976
I asked them -- these are all fluologists
and specialists in influenza --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.836
and I asked them the questions
you'd like to ask them:

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.048
What do you think the likelihood
is that there'll be a pandemic?

00:14:11.072 --> 00:14:13.749
If it happens, how bad
do you think it will be?

00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:18.713
Fifteen percent said they thought
there'd be a pandemic within three years.

00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:20.673
But much worse than that,

00:14:20.697 --> 00:14:24.159
90 percent said they thought
there'd be a pandemic

00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:27.104
within your children
or your grandchildren's lifetime.

00:14:28.247 --> 00:14:31.771
And they thought
that if there was a pandemic,

00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:33.811
a billion people would get sick.

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:38.152
As many as 165 million people would die.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.366
There would be a global
recession and depression

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.568
as our just-in-time inventory system

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:47.410
and the tight rubber band
of globalization broke,

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:51.378
and the cost to our economy
of one to three trillion dollars

00:14:51.402 --> 00:14:57.024
would be far worse for everyone
than merely 100 million people dying,

00:14:57.048 --> 00:14:59.350
because so many more people
would lose their job

00:14:59.374 --> 00:15:00.976
and their healthcare benefits,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.455
that the consequences
are almost unthinkable.

00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:09.000
And it's getting worse,
because travel is getting so much better.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.909
Let me show you a simulation
of what a pandemic looks like.

00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:19.746
So we know what we're talking about.

00:15:20.393 --> 00:15:24.000
Let's assume, for example,
that the first case occurs in South Asia.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.750
It initially goes quite slowly.

00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:30.390
You get two or three discrete locations.

00:15:32.128 --> 00:15:36.741
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,
and the disease will spread

00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:40.976
from country to country so fast
that you won't know what hit you.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.976
Within three weeks
it will be everywhere in the world.

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:51.137
Now, if we had an "undo" button,
and we could go back and isolate it

00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:54.518
and grab it when it first started --
if we could find it early,

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.976
and we had early detection
and early response,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.690
and we could put each one
of those viruses in jail --

00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:05.595
that's the only way to deal with
something like a pandemic.

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:09.000
And let me show you why that is.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.255
We have a joke.

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:14.103
This is an epidemic curve,
and everyone in medicine,

00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:16.550
I think, ultimately gets
to know what it is.

00:16:16.574 --> 00:16:17.728
But the joke is,

00:16:17.752 --> 00:16:20.861
an epidemiologist likes to arrive
at an epidemic right here

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:23.023
and ride to glory on the downhill curve.

00:16:23.047 --> 00:16:24.150
(Laughter)

00:16:24.174 --> 00:16:25.976
But you don't get to do that usually.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.978
You usually arrive right about here.

00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:33.809
What we really want is to arrive
right here, so we can stop the epidemic.

00:16:34.325 --> 00:16:35.756
But you can't always do that.

00:16:36.192 --> 00:16:39.749
But there's an organization
that has been able to find a way

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:41.976
to learn when the first cases occur,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.349
and that is called GPHIN;

00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:46.896
it's the Global Public Health
Information Network.

00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:49.334
And that simulation that I showed you

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:51.555
that you thought
was bird flu -- that was SARS.

00:16:51.963 --> 00:16:54.763
And SARS is the pandemic
that did not occur.

00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:56.731
And it didn't occur

00:16:56.755 --> 00:17:03.066
because GPHIN found
the pandemic-to-be of SARS

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:09.128
three months before WHO actually
announced it, and because of that,

00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:12.318
we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.

00:17:12.342 --> 00:17:14.423
And I think we owe
a great debt of gratitude

00:17:14.447 --> 00:17:16.604
to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,

00:17:16.628 --> 00:17:20.079
who I hope is in the audience
some place -- over there --

00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:21.976
who's the founder of GPHIN.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.483
(Applause)

00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:24.976
Hello, Ron!

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.800
(Applause)

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.224
And TED has flown Ron here
from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,

00:17:38.248 --> 00:17:42.685
because not only
did GPHIN find SARS early,

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:44.826
but you may have seen last week

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.181
that Iran announced
that they had bird flu in Iran,

00:17:49.205 --> 00:17:52.897
but GPHIN found the bird flu
in Iran not February 14 --

00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.778
but last September.

00:17:54.802 --> 00:17:57.462
We need an early-warning system

00:17:57.486 --> 00:18:01.821
to protect us against the things
that are humanity's worst nightmare.

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:06.441
And so my TED wish is based on
the common denominator

00:18:06.465 --> 00:18:07.831
of these experiences.

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:10.741
Smallpox -- early detection,
early response.

00:18:10.765 --> 00:18:13.892
Blindness, polio --
early detection, early response.

00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:18.241
Pandemic bird flu --
early detection, early response.

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:19.652
It is a litany.

00:18:19.676 --> 00:18:24.690
It is so obvious that our only way
of dealing with these new diseases

00:18:24.714 --> 00:18:29.041
is to find them early
and to kill them before they spread.

00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:33.473
So, my TED wish is for you
to help build a global system --

00:18:33.497 --> 00:18:34.976
an early-warning system --

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.731
to protect us against
humanity's worst nightmares.

00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:45.504
And what I thought I would call it
is "Early Detection,"

00:18:46.724 --> 00:18:48.848
But it should really be called ...

00:18:50.223 --> 00:18:51.872
"Total Early Detection."
[TED]

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:52.979
(Laughter)

00:18:53.003 --> 00:18:54.154
What?

00:18:54.178 --> 00:19:01.163
(Applause)

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:02.743
What?

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.250
(Applause)

00:19:06.219 --> 00:19:08.062
But in all seriousness,

00:19:08.086 --> 00:19:11.609
because this idea is birthed in TED,

00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:16.976
I would like it to be
a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.221
the "International System for Total
Early Disease Detection."

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:23.443
[INSTEDD]

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.386
And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.

00:19:33.235 --> 00:19:35.740
So instead of a hidden
pandemic of bird flu,

00:19:35.764 --> 00:19:37.764
we find it and immediately contain it.

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:43.598
Instead of a novel virus
caused by bio-terror or bio-error,

00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:47.609
or shift or drift,
we find it and we contain it.

00:19:48.268 --> 00:19:50.754
Instead of industrial
accidents like oil spills

00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:52.976
or the catastrophe in Bhopal,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.210
we find them, and we respond to them.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.913
Instead of famine,
hidden until it is too late,

00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:02.879
we detect it, and we respond.

00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:07.228
And instead of a system
which is owned by a government,

00:20:07.252 --> 00:20:09.673
and hidden in the bowels of government,

00:20:09.697 --> 00:20:12.299
let's build an early detection system

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:16.152
that's freely available to anyone
in the world in their own language.

00:20:16.858 --> 00:20:21.626
Let's make it transparent,
non-governmental,

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.706
not owned by any single
country or company,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.150
housed in a neutral country,
with redundant backup

00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:31.341
in a different time zone
and a different continent.

00:20:32.135 --> 00:20:34.128
And let's build it on GPHIN.

00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:35.534
Let's start with GPHIN.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.964
Let's increase the websites
that they crawl

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.976
from 20,000 to 20 million.

00:20:41.498 --> 00:20:44.007
Let's increase the languages they crawl

00:20:44.031 --> 00:20:46.824
from seven to 70, or more.

00:20:47.173 --> 00:20:50.713
Let's build in outbound
confirmation messages,

00:20:50.737 --> 00:20:54.001
using text messages or SMS
or instant messaging

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:56.835
to find out from people
who are within 100 meters

00:20:56.859 --> 00:20:58.610
of the rumor that you hear,

00:20:58.634 --> 00:20:59.976
if it is, in fact, valid.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.241
And let's add satellite confirmation.

00:21:02.614 --> 00:21:06.521
And we'll add Gapminder's
amazing graphics to the front end.

00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:10.463
And we'll grow it
as a moral force in the world,

00:21:10.487 --> 00:21:12.579
finding out those terrible things

00:21:12.603 --> 00:21:14.690
before anybody else knows about them,

00:21:14.714 --> 00:21:17.140
and sending our response to them,

00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:20.678
so that next year,
instead of us meeting here,

00:21:20.702 --> 00:21:24.256
lamenting how many terrible things
there are in the world,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.018
we will have pulled together,

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:30.921
used the unique skills
and the magic of this community,

00:21:30.945 --> 00:21:34.367
and be proud that we have done
everything we can to stop pandemics,

00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:38.401
other catastrophes, and change
the world, beginning right now.

00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:46.480
(Applause)

00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:01.176
Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.983
First of all, just so
everyone understands:

00:22:04.007 --> 00:22:08.523
you're saying that
by creating web crawlers,

00:22:08.547 --> 00:22:11.428
looking on the Internet for patterns,

00:22:11.452 --> 00:22:15.857
they can detect something suspicious

00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:18.534
before WHO, before anyone else can see it?

00:22:19.478 --> 00:22:22.335
Give an example of how
that could possibly be true.

00:22:23.174 --> 00:22:26.111
Larry Brilliant: You're not mad
about the copyright violation?

00:22:26.135 --> 00:22:27.294
CA: No. I love it.

00:22:27.318 --> 00:22:28.520
(Laughter)

00:22:28.544 --> 00:22:30.097
LB: Well, as Ron St. John --

00:22:30.121 --> 00:22:33.541
I hope you'll go and meet him
in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.

00:22:33.565 --> 00:22:36.118
When he started GPHIN --

00:22:36.142 --> 00:22:40.538
In 1997, there was an outbreak
of bird flu -- H5N1.

00:22:40.562 --> 00:22:41.849
It was in Hong Kong.

00:22:41.873 --> 00:22:45.055
And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong
responded immediately,

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:49.896
by slaughtering 1.5 million
chickens and birds,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.808
and they stopped
that outbreak in its tracks.

00:22:52.832 --> 00:22:56.044
Immediate detection, immediate response.

00:22:56.068 --> 00:22:57.562
Then a number of years went by,

00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:59.870
and there were a lot
of rumors about bird flu.

00:23:00.584 --> 00:23:04.372
Ron and his team in Ottawa
began to crawl the web --

00:23:04.396 --> 00:23:09.586
only crawling 20,000 different websites,
mostly periodicals --

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.833
and they read about
and heard about a concern,

00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:16.676
of a lot of children who had high fever
and symptoms of bird flu.

00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:19.514
They reported this to WHO.

00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:22.173
WHO took a little while taking action,

00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:26.856
because WHO will only receive
a report from a government,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.546
because it's the United Nations.

00:23:29.396 --> 00:23:32.798
But they were able to point
to WHO and let them know

00:23:32.822 --> 00:23:37.287
that there was this surprising
and unexplained cluster of illnesses

00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:38.715
that looked like bird flu.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.814
That turned out to be SARS.

00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:43.210
That's how the world found out about SARS.

00:23:43.805 --> 00:23:46.715
And because of that,
we were able to stop SARS.

00:23:46.739 --> 00:23:50.317
Now, what's really important is that,
before there was GPHIN,

00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:54.556
100 percent of all the world's
reports of bad things --

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.248
whether you're talking about famine

00:23:56.272 --> 00:23:59.350
or you're talking about bird flu
or you're talking about Ebola --

00:23:59.374 --> 00:24:02.113
100 percent of all those reports
came from nations.

00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:04.185
The moment these guys in Ottawa --

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:08.590
on a budget of 800,000 dollars
a year -- got cracking,

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:12.746
75 percent of all the reports
in the world came from GPHIN,

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.134
25 percent of all the reports in the world

00:24:15.158 --> 00:24:17.215
came from all the other 180 nations.

00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:20.484
Now, here's what's really interesting:

00:24:20.508 --> 00:24:23.151
after they'd been working
for a couple years,

00:24:23.175 --> 00:24:25.273
what do you think happened
to those nations?

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.480
They felt pretty stupid.

00:24:26.504 --> 00:24:28.717
So they started sending in
their reports early.

00:24:28.741 --> 00:24:32.597
And now, their reporting percentage
is down to 50 percent,

00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:35.039
because other nations
have started to report.

00:24:35.063 --> 00:24:39.229
So, can you find diseases
early by crawling the web?

00:24:39.253 --> 00:24:40.434
Of course you can.

00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:43.673
Can you find it even earlier
than GPHIN does now?

00:24:43.697 --> 00:24:44.848
Of course you can.

00:24:44.872 --> 00:24:49.477
You saw that they found SARS
using their Chinese web crawler

00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:54.444
a full six weeks before they found it
using their English web crawler.

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:57.182
Well, they're only crawling
in seven languages.

00:24:57.206 --> 00:24:59.712
These bad viruses really
don't have any intention

00:24:59.736 --> 00:25:02.194
of showing up first in English
or Spanish or French.

00:25:02.218 --> 00:25:04.217
(Laughter)

00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:08.725
So yes, I want to take GPHIN,
I want to build on it.

00:25:09.312 --> 00:25:12.664
I want to add all the languages
of the world that we possibly can.

00:25:12.688 --> 00:25:14.976
I want to make this open to everybody,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.976
so that the health officer
in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.294
will have as much access to it
as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.

00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:25.128
And I want to make it part of our culture

00:25:25.152 --> 00:25:28.739
that there is a community of people
who are watching out

00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:30.976
for the worst nightmares of humanity,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
and that it's accessible to everyone.
