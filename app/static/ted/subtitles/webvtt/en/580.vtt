00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A talk about surgical robots

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is also a talk about surgery.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
than normal people do,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if it were done without consent,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
would be a felony.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the carpenters -- some would say the butchers --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of the medical world:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
cutting, reshaping, reforming,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
bypassing, fixing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But you need to talk about surgical instruments

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the evolution of surgical technology together.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So in order to give you some kind of a perspective

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of where we are right now

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with surgical robots,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and where we're going to be going in the future,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I want to give you a little bit of perspective

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of how we got to this point,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
how we even came to believe

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that surgery was OK,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that this was something that was possible to do,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, a little bit of perspective --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
about 10,000 years of perspective.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is a trephinated skull.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
have been found in archaeological sites

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
all over the world,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
dating back five to 10 thousand years.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You are a healer in a Stone Age village.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But you think to yourself,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now that is surgical thinking.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What is astonishing about this is,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
even though we don't know really how much of this

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was intended to be religious,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
what we can tell is that these patients lived!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
they lived days, months, years following trephination.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And so what we are seeing is evidence

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
of a refined technique

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
all over the world.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This arose independently at sites everywhere

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that had no communication to one another.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now we can fast forward many thousands of years

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
into the Bronze Age and beyond.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And we see new refined tools coming out.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
than their bold, trephinating ancestors.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
These guys confined their surgery

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to fairly superficial injuries.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And surgeons were tradesmen,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
rather than physicians.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
That may have saved the writers,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They were still a mistrusted lot.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
because the landscape was dominated

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
by the itinerant barber surgeon.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Because we were in the age before anesthesia,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the agony of the patient

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is really as much of the public spectacle

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as the surgery itself.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
shown here doing a lithotomy --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which is the removal of the bladder stone,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
had to take less than two minutes.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and be really, really quick.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
wandering around in Europe,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which is an astonishing number,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I mean who would put themselves through that?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
at the Mass. General in 1847,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to start to delve deeper into the body.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This was truly a revolution in surgery.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But there was a pretty big problem with this.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
After these very long, painstaking operations,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the patients died.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
They died of massive infection.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Surgery didn't hurt anymore,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but it killed you pretty quickly.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
until the next big revolution in surgery,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
which was aseptic technique.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Joseph Lister was aepsis's,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
or sterility's, biggest advocate,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But eventually they did come around.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And they came back to their American clinic and they said

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they had learned it was as important to wash your hands

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
before doing surgery

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
as it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Something so simple.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
These surgeries were actually now being effective.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
With the patient insensitive to pain,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and a sterile operating field

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
all bets were off, the sky was the limit.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You could now start doing surgery everywhere,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
on the gut, on the liver,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
on the heart, on the brain.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
you could put it in another person, and it would work.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
they had become gods.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but at quite a cost,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
because they are saving lives,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but not necessarily quality of life,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
because healthy people don't usually need surgery,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The question had to be asked,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
"Well, can we do these same surgeries

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
but through little incisions?"

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
surgery with long instruments through small incisions.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
until the 1980s,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that allowed this to be done for real operations.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We bring instruments in,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
from two separate cuts in the side,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and then you can start manipulating tissue.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
being done laparoscopically,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
a majority of gallbladder surgeries

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
were being done laparoscopically --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
truly a pretty big revolution.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
But there were casualties of this revolution.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
These techniques were a lot harder to learn

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
than people had anticipated.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The learning curve was very long.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
They had to give up their wrists.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But this is hard.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And one of the reasons why it is so hard

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is because the external ergonomics are terrible.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and put it on the other side of that small incision,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And so -- I get to talk about robots --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
the da Vinci robot

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
you can precisely place the needle in your instruments,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and you can pass it all the way through

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and follow it in a trajectory.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And the reason why this becomes so much easier

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is -- you can see on the bottom --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the hands are making the motions,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and the instruments are following those motions exactly.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is a large, fairly complicated robot.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The surgeon is sitting at a console,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and controlling the robot with these controllers.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And the robot is moving these instruments around,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and powering them, down inside the body.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And since this was introduced in 1999,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
a lot of these robots have been out

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
which is a prostate deep in the pelvis,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and it requires fine dissection

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and delicate manipulation

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
to be able to get a good surgical outcome.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
without cracking the chest.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This is all done in between the ribs.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And you can go inside the heart itself

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and repair the valves from the inside.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
You've got these technologies -- thank you --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Applause)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And there are some reasons, some good reasons.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And cost is one of them.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I talked about the large, complicated robot.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
More useful than a solid gold surgeon,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But there are other barriers.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So something like a prostatectomy --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the prostate is small, and it's in one spot,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and you can set your robot up very precisely

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to work in that one spot.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And so it's perfect for something like that.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And in fact if you, or anyone you know,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
chances are it was done with one of these systems.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
But if you need to reach more places than just one,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
you need to move the robot.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And you need to put some new incisions in there.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And you need to re-set it up.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And then you need to add some more ports, and more.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And for that reason there are many surgeries

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
each time we wanted to move somewhere different?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
What if we could bring all the instruments

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in together in one place?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And how would that change the experience for the patient?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Now, to do that,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we need to be able to bring a camera

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and instruments in together through one small tube,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So what's going to come out of that tube

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
is the debut of this new technology,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Ready? So here it comes.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
This is the camera, and three instruments.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And as you see it come out,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in order to actually be able to do anything useful,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
it can't all stay clustered up like this.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It has to be able to come off of the centerline

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and then be able to work back toward that centerline.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He's a cheeky little devil.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But what this lets you do

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is gives you that all-important traction,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and counter-traction,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
so that you can dissect, so that you can sew,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
so that you can do all the things that you need to do,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
all the surgical tasks.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But it's all coming in through one incision.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
It's not so simple.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as we're going around.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
For the patient, however,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And I think to really get the rest of the way

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in that revolution,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
we need to not just take our hands in in new ways,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We need to see beyond the surface.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
in a much better way.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
This is a cancer surgery.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
One of the problems with this,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
is you can't see the cancer,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
especially when it's hidden below the surface.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And so what we're starting to do

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
is we're starting to inject specially designed markers

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It will go, bind to the cancer.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And we can make those markers glow.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And we can take special cameras,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and we can look at it.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Now we know where we need to cut,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
even when it's below the surface.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
so that when we do a new vessel

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and we bypass a blockage on the heart,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
we can see if we actually made the connection,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
before we close that patient back up again --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
something that we haven't been able to do

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
without radiation before.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We can light up tumors

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
like this kidney tumor,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
so that you can exactly see where the boundary is

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And we don't even need to confine ourselves

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to this macro vision.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
We have flexible microscopic probes

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
that we can bring down into the body.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And we can look at cells directly.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So this is all very prototypey at this point.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Because they let you keep continence,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
bladder control, and sexual function after surgery,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
all of which is generally fairly important to the patient.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So, with the combination of these technologies

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
we can reach it all, and we can see it all.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We can heal the disease.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And we can leave the patient whole and intact

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and functional afterwards.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Now, I've talked about the patient

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
outside this room.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And that is not the case.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Many of you, all of you maybe,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And when you get to that point --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I mean, these maladies don't care

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
how many books you've written,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
how many companies you've started,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
that Nobel Prize you have yet to win,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
how much time you planned to spend with your children.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
These maladies come for us all.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I'm not sure I really even want it to.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Because facing your own mortality

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
causes a re-evaluation of priorities,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
What I want instead,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
is for you to be whole, intact,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and functional enough to go out and save the world,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
after you've decided you need to do it.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And that is my vision for your future.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Thank you.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:31.000
(Applause)
