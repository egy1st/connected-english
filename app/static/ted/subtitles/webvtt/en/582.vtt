00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to share with you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
some ideas about the secret power of time,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in a very short time.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
15 seconds studio.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
10, nine, eight, seven,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
six, five, four, three, two ...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of the principals in Adam's temptation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
"I don't know, guys.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I don't want to get in trouble."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
present focus and future focus.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
thank you George Bush --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And most of them did so without using birth control.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So much for promises.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
went back 14 years later,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to try to discover what was different about those kids.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and kids who yielded, in many ways.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the key for you,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Time perspective is the study of how individuals,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
into time zones or time categories.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They vary between cultures, between nations,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
between individuals, between social classes,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
between education levels.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And the problem is that they can become biased,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What determines any decision you make?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we're going to call them "present-oriented,"

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because their focus is what is now.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
For others, the present is irrelevant.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So that their decisions are based on past memories.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
For others it's not the past, it's not the present,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it's only about the future.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Cost-benefit analysis.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, time paradox, I want to argue,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the paradox of time perspective,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is something that influences every decision you make,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you're totally unaware of.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
biased time perspectives.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You can be present-hedonistic,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Or you can be transcendental future:

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
namely, life begins after death.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
depending on the demands of the situation,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that's what you've got to learn to do.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And moderate on present-hedonism.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And always low on past-negative

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and present-fatalism.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
What you get from the future is wings

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to soar to new destinations, new challenges.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What you get from the present hedonism

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
places, people, sensuality.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What do futures sacrifice for success?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And they live for work, achievement and control.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'm here as a future-oriented person

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Told me don't eat that marshmallow,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
until I learned to balance out.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and I'm happier than I have ever been.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
changing the drop-out rates of school kids,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
combating addictions, enhancing teen health,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
promoting sustainability and conservation,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So I want to end by saying:

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
many of life's puzzles can be solved

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the idea is so simple, so obvious,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but I think the consequences are really profound.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Thank you so much.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(Applause)
