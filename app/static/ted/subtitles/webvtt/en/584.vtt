00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
40 percent of all post-conflict situations,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Why has the record been so poor?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well, the conventional approach

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to post-conflict situations

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
has rested on, on kind of, three principles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The first principle is: it's the politics that matters.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Try and build a political settlement first.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And then the second step is to say,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, short-term peacekeepers.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's an election.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So that's the conventional approach.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I think that approach denies reality.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We see that there is no quick fix.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There's certainly no quick security fix.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
during our post-conflict decade.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What an election produces is a winner and a loser.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the loser is unreconciled.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's not the politics first;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it's actually the politics last.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The politics become easier as the decade progresses

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
if you're building on a foundation

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of security and economic development --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the rebuilding of prosperity.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Why does the politics get easier?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And why is it so difficult initially?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because after years of stagnation and decline,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If the reality is stagnation,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I can only go up if you go down.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And that doesn't produce a productive politics.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And so the mentality has to shift from

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
zero-sum to positive-sum

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
before you can get a productive politics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
You can only get positive, that mental shift,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
if the reality is that prosperity is being built.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So that is what you get when you face reality.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But the objective of facing reality

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is to change reality.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And so now let me suggest

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
two complimentary approaches

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to changing the reality of the situations.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The first is to recognize the interdependence

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
of three key actors, who are different actors,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and at the moment are uncoordinated.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The first actor is the Security Council.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The Security Council typically has the responsibility

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
for providing the peacekeepers

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
who build the security.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And that needs to be recognized,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
first of all, that peacekeeping works.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It is a cost-effective approach.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It does increase security.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But it needs to be done long-term.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It needs to be a decade-long approach,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
rather than just a couple of years.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That's one actor, the Security Council.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The second actor, different cast of guys,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is the donors.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The donors provide post-conflict aid.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Typically in the past,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the donors have been interested in the first couple of years,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and then they got bored.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They moved on to some other situation.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Post-conflict economic recovery

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is a slow process.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
There are no quick processes in economics

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
except decline.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You can do that quite fast.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Laughter)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So the donors have to stick with this situation

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for at least a decade.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And then the third key actor

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
is the post-conflict government.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And there are two key things it's got to do.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
One is it's got to do economic reform,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
not fuss about the political constitution.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It's got to reform economic policy.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Why? Because during conflict

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
economic policy typically deteriorates.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Governments snatch short-term opportunities

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
bringing people inside the tent.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So those three actors.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And they are interdependent

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
over a long term.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
If the Security Council doesn't commit to security

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
over the course of a decade,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you don't get the economic recovery,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So we should recognize that interdependence,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
by formal, mutual commitments.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The United Nations actually has a language

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
it's called the language of compact.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so we need a post-conflict compact.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's called the Peace Building Commission.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
where, when we got to a post-conflict situation,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
there was an expectation of these mutual commitments

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
from the three parties.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So that's idea one:

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
recognize interdependence.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
of different actors with different priorities.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you get a very unfocused agenda,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
because in these situations, needs are everywhere,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but the capacity to implement change is very limited.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
three things are critical.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
One is jobs.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
One is improvements in basic services --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
especially health, which is a disaster during conflict.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So jobs, health, and clean government.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Those are the three critical priorities.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Jobs.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
What is a distinctive approach

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to generating jobs in post-conflict situations?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And why are jobs so important?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
In post-conflict situations,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the reason that they so often revert to conflict,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is not because elderly women get upset.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It's because young men get upset.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And so we need a process of generating jobs,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
for ordinary young men, fast.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Now, that is difficult.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Governments in post-conflict situation

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
often respond by puffing up the civil service.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
That is not a good idea.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It's not sustainable.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
In fact, you're building a long-term liability

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
by inflating civil service.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
because any activity which is open to international trade

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is basically going to be uncompetitive

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in a post-conflict situation.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and which can generate a lot of jobs,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and which is, in any case, a sensible sector

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to expand, post-conflict,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and that is the construction sector.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The construction sector has a vital role,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
obviously, in reconstruction.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
During conflict people are doing destruction.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then when you try and expand it,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
because it's shriveled away,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
you encounter a lot of bottlenecks.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Basically, prices soar

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
but it doesn't generate any jobs.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in expanding the construction sector.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What might the bottlenecks be?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Just think what you have to do

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
First you need access to land.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Often the legal system is broken down

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
so you can't even get access to land.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Secondly you need skills,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the mundane skills of the construction sector.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
we need Bricklayers Without Borders,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to rebuild the skill set.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
We need firms. The firms have gone away.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
If we do that, we not only get the jobs,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we get the improvements in public infrastructure,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
the restoration of public infrastructure.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Let me turn from jobs to the second objective,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
which is improving basic social services.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
in the donor community,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
as to how to build basic services

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
in post-conflict sectors.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
On the one hand it pays lip service

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
to the idea of rebuild an effective state

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that deliver these services.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
donors know that's not a realistic agenda,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and so what they also do is the total bypass:

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
just fund NGOs.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Neither of those approaches is sensible.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And so what I'd suggest

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
is what I call Independent Service Authorities.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the delivery of services on the ground,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you should use whatever works --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
churches, NGOs, local communities,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
whatever works.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And in between, there should be a public agency,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
the Independent Service Authority,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
which channels public money,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and especially donor money,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
to the retail providers.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So the NGOs become part of a public government system,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
rather than independent of it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You can use yardstick competition,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
so they have to compete against each other

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
for the resources.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
They want to have the discipline and accountability.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And because the government would be funding it,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
it would be co-branding these services.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the United States government and some NGO.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
They would be co-branded

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Clean means follow their money.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that it needs our money

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
just to be on a life-support system.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You can't get the basic functions of the state done

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
unless we put money into the core budget of these countries.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But, if we put money into the core budget,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that mean that money will be well spent.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
it's not just that the money is wasted --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that's the least of the problems --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
it's that the money is captured.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So building clean government means, yes, provide money

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to the budget,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
but also provide a lot of scrutiny,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Paddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
to the United Nations,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in his book about his experience, he said,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
"I realize what I needed

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
was accountants without borders,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to follow that money."

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So that's the -- let me wrap up,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
this is the package.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
What's the goal?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
That after 10 years,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the focus on the construction sector

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
would have produced both jobs

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and, hence, security --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
because young people would have jobs --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So that's the focus on the construction sector.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
The focus on the basic service delivery

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
through these independent service authorities

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
would have rescued basic services

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
from their catastrophic levels,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and it would have given ordinary people

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
the sense that the government was doing something useful.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
The emphasis on clean government

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
because there wouldn't be any money

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
in taking part in the politics.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And so gradually the selection,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the composition of politicians,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
would shift from the crooked to the honest.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Where would that leave us?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Gradually it would shift

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
from a politics of plunder

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to a politics of hope. Thank you.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Applause)
