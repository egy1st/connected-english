00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what it could be,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and what your relationship to it is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an imagined future, if you will,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"Once in a lifetime

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and hope and history rhyme."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want to start with these word pairs here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when the foundation form was actually invented,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In fact they would never have thought of themselves

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
as closed and set in their ways,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
as slow to respond to new challenges,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
as small and risk-averse.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But by the end of the 20th century,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a new generation of critics and reformers

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
had come to see philanthropy just this way.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The thing to watch for

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
as a global philanthropy industry comes about --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and that's exactly what is happening --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is how the aspiration is to flip

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
these old assumptions,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for philanthropy to become open and big

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and fast and connected, in service of the long term.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This entrepreneurial energy

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is emerging from many quarters.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
by new tools, like the ones we've seen here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and by new pressures.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This report is our main public report.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What it tells is the story of how today

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
actually could be as historic

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
as 100 years ago.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that are going on with you.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the Gates or the Soros or the Google.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Instead, what I want to do

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the democratization of philanthropy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is a moment in history when the average person

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
has more power than at any time.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, this may surprise you.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
has captured the assumption that this challenges

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in such a beautiful way.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
He said, "We have lived in this world

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
where little things are done for love

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and big things for money.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now we have Wikipedia.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Suddenly big things can be done for love."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
WISER stands for World Index

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
for Social and Environmental Responsibility.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
WISER sets out to document, link and empower

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
what Paul calls the largest movement,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and fastest-growing movement in human history:

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
humanity's collective immune response

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to today's threats.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
aren't going to take off.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But the ones that do

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
are going to be the biggest, the most open,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This is, of course, to philanthropy

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this challenges yet another assumption,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
where a donor can go straight into a classroom

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and connect with what a teacher says they need.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Take a look at Changing the Present,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
GiveIndia is for a whole country.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And it goes on and on.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
which I call aggregated giving.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in that historic act last summer.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's that he challenged another assumption,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that every giver should have his or her own

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
fund or foundation.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
There are now, today, so many new funds

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that are aggregating giving and investing,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
bringing together people

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
around a common goal, to think bigger.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Take a look at these.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
These funds are to philanthropy

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
are to investing,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but with a twist --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because often a community forms around these funds,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
as it has at Acumen and other places.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Now, imagine for a second

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
these first three types of experiments:

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And understand how they help us re-perceive

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
what organized philanthropy is.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when these things come together in the experiments of the future --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
imagine that somebody puts up, say,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
100 million dollars

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
for an inspiring goal --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
not out of the question --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but only puts it up if it's matched

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
by millions of small gifts from around the globe,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
thereby engaging lots of people,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and building visibility and engaging people

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
in the goal that's stated.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
which are innovation, competitions and social investing.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They're betting a visible competition, a prize,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and thereby speed the solution.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This tackles yet another assumption,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that the giver and the organization is at the center,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as opposed to putting the problem at the center.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
You can look to these innovators

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to help us especially with things that require

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
technological or scientific solution.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
That leaves the final category, social investing,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
represented here by Xigi.net.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that business is business,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Xigi is a new community site

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that's built by the community,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
linking and mapping this new social capital market.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It lists already 1,000 entities

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So we can look to these innovators

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to help us remember

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that seeks a return,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the good that can be driven could be astonishing.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now, what's really interesting here

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
is that we're not thinking our way

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
into a new way of acting;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Philanthropy is reorganizing itself

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
before our very eyes.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
don't yet fulfill this aspiration,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I think this is the new zeitgeist:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
open, big, fast, connected,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and, let us also hope, long.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
whatever it is you pick, stick with it --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But I'm really hopeful.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that's reorganizing itself,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it's also whole other portions of the social sector,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and of business,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that are busy challenging "business as usual."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And everywhere I go, including here at TED,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I feel that there is a new moral hunger

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that is growing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What we're seeing is people really wrestling

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to describe what is this new thing that's happening.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Words like "philanthrocapitalism,"

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and "venture philanthropy."

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We don't have a language for it yet.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Whatever we call it,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
it's new, it's beginning,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and I think it's gong to quite significant.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And that's where my imagined future comes in,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which I am going to call the social singularity.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
where a number of trends accelerate and converge

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
It may be that the social singularity

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
ahead is the one that we fear the most:

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
a convergence of catastrophes,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of environmental degradation,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
of poverty.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
That's because

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
our ability to confront the problems that we face

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
has not kept pace with our ability to create them.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And as we've heard here,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
it is no exaggeration to say

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
as never before.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The question is, is there a positive social singularity?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Is there a frontier for us

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
of how we live together?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But we have a problem.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
or who we're going to need to be.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We are going to need

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
a new generation of citizen leaders

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
as rapidly as possible.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of my grandfather and great-grandfather.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And they were great community leaders.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I keep this photograph close by to me --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
it's in my office --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
both of whom I never knew.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And so, in their honor,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I want to offer you this blank slide.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And I want you to imagine

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that this a photograph of you.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I want you to think about the community

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that you want to be part of creating.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Whatever that means to you.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And I want you to imagine

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that it's 100 years from now,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and your grandchild, or great-grandchild,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
or niece or nephew or god-child,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
is looking at this photograph of you.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:01.000
What is the story you most want for them to tell?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
(Applause)
