00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A month ago today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I stood there:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
90 degrees south, the top of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Together we had just broken the world speed record

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for a trek to the South Pole.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It took us 33 days,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We shaved five days off the previous best time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And in the process, I became the first person in history

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to make the entire 650-mile journey,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
solely on feet, without skis.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is this tough to do?"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Imagine, if you will,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with 170 pounds of gear,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You'll be in a massive headwind.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
these crevasses.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that could give way at a moment's notice,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yes, it's uphill the entire way,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and you're starting at sea level.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It began a little less than two years ago.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A couple of buddies of mine and I

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And while we were there we learned

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
affected young people the most.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a reason for me to do them

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
beyond just getting there.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Around that time I met an extraordinary human being,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a run to the South Pole

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
where, with an interactive website,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
on board the expedition with me,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
as active members.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we would be blogging, telling stories of,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
or we will burn.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because that's what it felt like.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We were blogging to this live website daily

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to these students that were tracking us as well,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
about 10-hour trekking days,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
15-hour trekking days,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In turn, students,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
people from around the world, would ask us questions.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Young people would ask the most amazing questions.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We were burning about 8,500 a day,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
so we needed it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
was charged by the sun.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And do you get along? I certainly hope so,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because at some point or another on this expedition,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But seriously, seriously, we did get along,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
dragging sleds across the school-yard,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
45 below that day, I'll never forget it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We looked at each other with these looks

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
of disbelief at what we had just completed.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I remember looking at the guys thinking,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
As I stand here today talking to you guys,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I've been running for the grand sum of five years.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
living a very sedentary lifestyle.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
What I take from this journey, from my journeys,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
is that, in fact,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
within every fiber of my belief standing here,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I know that we can make the impossible possible.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I'm learning this at 40.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Imagine being 13 years old,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
hearing those words, and believing it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Applause)
