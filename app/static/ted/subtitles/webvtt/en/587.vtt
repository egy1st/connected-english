00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, if President Obama

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
then I would have a suggestion for him

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I think would vastly improve

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the mathematics education in this country.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And it would be easy to implement

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and inexpensive.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The mathematics curriculum that we have

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And everything we learn after that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is building up towards one subject.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I'm here to say

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
every high school graduate should know --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
should be statistics:

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
probability and statistics.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Applause)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's one of the great products of the human mind.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
they should definitely learn calculus

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by the end of their freshman year of college.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that very few people actually use calculus

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
On the other hand,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and should, use on daily basis. Right?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's understanding data.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think if our students, if our high school students --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if all of the American citizens --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
knew about probability and statistics,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean, probability and statistics,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Look, the world has changed

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
from analog to digital.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
from analog to digital,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the mathematics of uncertainty,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of randomness, of data --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that being probability and statistics.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In summary, instead of our students

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
learning about the techniques of calculus,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I think it would be far more significant

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
if all of them knew what two standard deviations

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
from the mean means. And I mean it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Thank you very much.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
(Applause)
