00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the exact moment

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that I started creating something called Tinkering School.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and hammers and other dangerous objects,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and be trusted.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Trusted not to hurt themselves,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and trusted not to hurt others.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and there are no tests.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When the kids arrive

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
they're confronted with lots of stuff:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
wood and nails and rope and wheels,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and lots of tools, real tools.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And within that context, we can offer the kids time --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
something that seems in short supply

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in their over-scheduled lives.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Our goal is to ensure that they leave

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with a better sense of how to make things

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than when they arrived,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the deep internal realization

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that you can figure things out by fooling around.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
(Laughter)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And the kids soon learn

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that all projects go awry --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and become at ease with the idea that every step

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in a project is a step closer

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to sweet success,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or gleeful calamity.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We start from doodles and sketches.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And sometimes we make real plans.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And sometimes we just start building.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Building is at the heart of the experience:

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
hands on, deeply immersed

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and fully committed to the problem at hand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Robin and I, acting as collaborators,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
keep the landscape of the projects

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
tilted towards completion.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Success is in the doing,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and failures are celebrated and analyzed.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Problems become puzzles

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and obstacles disappear.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When faced with particularly difficult

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
setbacks or complexities,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Decoration of the unfinished project

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is a kind of conceptual incubation.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
From these interludes come deep insights

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and amazing new approaches to solving the problems

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that had them frustrated just moments before.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
All materials are available for use.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
can become a bridge

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
stronger than anyone imagined.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And the things that they build

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
amaze even themselves.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Video: Three, two, one, go!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Video: Yay!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Applause)

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Applause)
