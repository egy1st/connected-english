00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's something which is suspended

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
between what we believe we can be,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and a tradition we may have forgotten.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And yet, when I look at the environment outside,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you see how resistant architecture is to change.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can think them out. We can create incredible things.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And yet, at the end,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it's so hard to change a wall.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We applaud the well-mannered box.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to create something that has never been,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I think that's really what architecture is based on.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Architecture is not based on concrete

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and steel and the elements of the soil.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's based on wonder.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the greatest spaces that we have had.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
By the way, it is a story that is told through

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
its hard materials.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But it is a story of effort and struggle

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
against improbabilities.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of the pyramids, of pagodas,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of cities in India and beyond,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you think of how incredible this is that that was realized

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
not by some abstract idea, but by people.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, anything that has been made can be unmade.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Anything that has been made can be made better.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There it is: the things that I really believe

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
are of important architecture.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
These are the dimensions that I like to work with.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's something very personal.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or architecture critics or city planners.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But I think these are the necessary oxygen

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for us to live in buildings, to live in cities,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to connect ourselves in a social space.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And it is that belief that I think drives society.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And yet it is in times like this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They were built in times that were

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
not really the best of times in a certain way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And yet that energy and power of architecture

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So again, I am a believer in the expressive.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I have never been a fan of the neutral.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I don't like neutrality in life, in anything.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I think expression.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's what expression is.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's been missing in much of the architecture,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that has no value.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And yet, I believe it is the expression --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
expression of the city, expression of our own space --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that gives meaning to architecture.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Expressive spaces are not spaces

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that simply confirm what we already know.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Expressive spaces may disturb us.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And I think that's also part of life.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but to reach out across the abyss of history,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to places we have never been,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So again, radical versus conservative.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of dead forms.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It is actually a living connection

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to the cosmic event that we are part of,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and a story that is certainly ongoing.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's actually a story in which our acts themselves

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are pushing the story in a particular way.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You know the Soviet architecture of that building

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is the conservation.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that have obstructed the mind in moving forward

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and of course what is radical is to confront them.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And I think our architecture is a confrontation

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
with our own senses.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Therefore I believe it should not be cool.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Life without emotion would really not be life.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Even the mind is emotional.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
There is no reason which does not take a position

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So I think emotion is a dimension

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that is important to introduce into city space, into city life.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
is a conversation that I think

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
cities themselves have fostered.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I think that is the progress of cities.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's not only the forms of cities,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but the fact that they incarnate emotions,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
not just of those who build them,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but of those who live there as well.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But architecture is not the language of words.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
tell you a story, but the story is very short,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
which says, "We have no story to tell you."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So the important thing actually,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
which might be totally inexplicable in words,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because they operate in proportions,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
in materials, in light.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
They connect themselves into various sources,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
into a kind of complex vector matrix

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that isn't really frontal

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but is really embedded in the lives,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and in the history of a city, and of a people.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I think is a false notion,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
which has reduced architecture into banality.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Hand versus the computer.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Of course, what would we be without computers?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Our whole practice depends on computing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Because I believe that the hand

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
has a source, though the source is unknown,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
though we don't have to be mystical about it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We realize that the hand has been given us

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And I think when I draw drawings

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
drawings that can come from sources

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that are completely not known, not normal, not seen,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
how can we make the computer respond to our hand

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
rather than the hand responding to the computer.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
genetics, economics

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
are complex complex fields.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
There is no reason that architecture should shy away

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and present this illusory world of the simple.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It is complex. Space is complex.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And as wondrous as it is,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that we have often come to be admired.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And yet, our lives are complex.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Our emotions are complex.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Our intellectual desires are complex.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So I do believe that architecture as I see it

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in every intimacy that we possess.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Of course that means that architecture is political.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The political is not an enemy of architecture.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The politeama is the city. It's all of us together.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I've always believed that the act of architecture,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
because it will be visible to others.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So again, the evasion of that sphere,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
has never appealed to me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I do believe that this interaction

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with the history, with history that is often very difficult,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to grapple with it, to create

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Because architecture is also the asking of questions.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
It's not only the giving of answers.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Therefore it is important that it be real.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You know we can simulate almost anything.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But the one thing that can be ever simulated

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is the human heart, the human soul.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the threshold, the bed --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
such prosaic objects. And yet,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
which is so enigmatic and so rich,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and create something in the real world.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Create a space for an office,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
a space of sustainability

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that really works between that virtuality

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and yet can be realized as something real.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Unexpected versus habitual.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
It's a self-induced poison.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So the unexpected is always unexpected.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
will always be unexpected.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
the false sort of stability,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but an architecture that is full of tension,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
an architecture that goes beyond itself

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to reach a human soul and a human heart,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and that breaks out of the shackles of habits.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And of course habits are enforced by architecture.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
When we see the same kind of architecture

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we become immured in that world of those angles,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
of those lights, of those materials.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
We think the world really looks like our buildings.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that have been part of them.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So again, the unexpected which is also the raw.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And I often think of the raw and the refined.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
What is raw? The raw, I would say

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is the naked experience, untouched by luxury,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
untouched by expensive materials,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
untouched by the kind of refinement

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that we associate with high culture.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So the rawness, I think, in space,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
translate into a raw space,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
a space that isn't decorated,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a space that is not mannered in any source,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
might be refractive to our desires.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
A space that doesn't always follow us

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
like a dog that has been trained to follow us,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
other possibilities, other experiences,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
something which is focused on reality,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
something that has the power, through its leverage,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
to transform even a very small space.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So architecture maybe is not so big, like science,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
but through its focal point

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
it can leverage in an Archimedian way

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
what we think the world is really about.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And often it takes just a building

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And of course buildings have their shapes.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Those shapes are difficult to change.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And yet, I do believe that in every social space,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in every public space,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
there is a desire to communicate more

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
forward, backward, sideways and around.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So that is indeed what is memory.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So I believe that my main interest is to memory.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Without memory we would be amnesiacs.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We would not know which way we were going,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and why we are going where we're going.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
rehashing of the same things over and over again,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which, of course, get accolades of critics.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But I rather play something

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
completely unheard of,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and even with flaws,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
by its meaninglessness.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Without the memory there would be no story to tell.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
There would be nowhere to turn.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And it's not only our memory,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but those who remember us,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
which means that architecture is not mute.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's an art of communication.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It can reach into millennia

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that have been buried,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and return them in a just and unexpected equity.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So again, I think the notion that

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And that indeed is the architectural mission

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that I believe is important,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is to create spaces that are vibrant,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that are pluralistic,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
that can transform the most prosaic activities,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and raise them to a completely different expectation.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Create a shopping center, a swimming place

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that is more like a museum than like entertainment.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And these are our dreams.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
it should not play it safe.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And I think, of course,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
risk is what underlies the world.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
World without risk would not be worth living.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Risks of spaces that have never been

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
so dizzying,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
as they should be, for a pioneering city.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Risks that really move architecture

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
even with all its flaws, into a space which is much better

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that the ever again repeated

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
hollowness of a ready-made thing.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It's about space. It's not about fashion.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It's not about decoration.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It's about creating with minimal means

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
something which can not be repeated,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
cannot be simulated in any other sphere.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
is the space we need to dream.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
These are the spaces that are

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
not just luxurious spaces for some of us,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
but are important for everybody in this world.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's about carving out a space for trees.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It's carving out a space where nature can enter

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
the domestic world of a city.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
A space where something which has never seen a light of day

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
can enter into the inner workings of a density.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And I think that is really the nature of architecture.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Now I am a believer in democracy.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I don't like beautiful buildings

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
built for totalitarian regimes.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And yet when I think of the poverty of society

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
which doesn't give freedom to its people,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I don't admire those buildings.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And of course, at Ground Zero what else?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's such a complex project.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It's emotional. There is so many interests.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
It's political. There is so many parties to this project.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
There are emotions of the victims.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I would not have liked somebody to say,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want."

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I think nothing good will come out of that.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I think architecture is about consensus.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Compromise, if it's artistic,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
if it is able to cope with its strategies --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and there is my first sketch and the last rendering --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
it's not that far away.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And yet, compromise, consensus,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
that is what I believe in.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And that is where I end.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
on a ship like millions of others,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
looking at America from that point of view.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
This is America. This is liberty.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
This is what we dream about. Its individuality,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Applause)

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So have you come to peace

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
with the process that happened at Ground Zero

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Daniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
of the notion that we are authoritarian,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
that we can determine everything that happens.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
We have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
will be meaningful, will be inspiring,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
will tell other generations of the sacrifices,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
of the meaning of this event.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Not just for New York, but for the world.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Daniel Libeskind.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
(Applause)
