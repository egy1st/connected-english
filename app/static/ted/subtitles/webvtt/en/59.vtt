00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
on his first successful telephone call,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Laughter)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I just really want to thank you very much.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"What a strange, long trip."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And he should have said,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
My lower half is appearing at a different conference

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in a different country.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'll explain at another time.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And though I'm a rock star,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But what really turns me on about technology

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I hope, I believe.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What turns me on about the digital age,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
what excites me personally,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you needed a studio and a producer.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, you need a laptop.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and a Hollywood budget.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And that really, really excites me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Political, economic, psychological, whatever.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that no one knew could even be budged.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I got to this place.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's a journey that started 20 years ago.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You may remember that song, "We Are the World,"

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Band Aid, Live Aid.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
issued a challenge to "feed the world."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The children had a name for me.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
They called me, "The girl with the beard."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Laughter)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Don't ask.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Beautiful, royal people.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
a man handed me his baby and said,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"Would you take my son with you?"

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It was the middle of that awful famine.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, I turned him down.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And in that moment, I started this journey.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Except this isn't the cause, is it?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
a preventable, treatable disease --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
20 million by the end of the decade.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So what we're talking about here is human rights.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The right to live like a human.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The right to live, period.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And what we're facing in Africa is

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and what this problem isn't.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Because this is not all about charity.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
This is about justice. Really.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
This is not about charity. This is about justice.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
That's right.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We like to give, and we give a lot.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Look at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But justice is a tougher standard than charity.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It makes a farce of our idea of equality.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It questions our commitment.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and if we're honest,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Not here, not in America, not in Europe.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
admitted this to me. And it's really true.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Africa is a continent in flames.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
we would all do more to put the fire out.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We're standing around with watering cans,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
when what we really need is the fire brigade.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It's crazy, really, when you think about it.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to exist in the front of our brain?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The slow extinguishing of countless lives

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is just not dramatic enough, it would appear.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Catastrophes that we can avert

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
are not as interesting as ones we could avert.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Funny, that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
offends the intellectual rigor in this room.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but the fact that it's not on the nightly news,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that we in Europe, or you in America,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
are not treating it like an emergency --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
it could be soon.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Every week, religious extremists take another African village.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
They're attempting to bring order to chaos.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Well, why aren't we?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Poverty breeds despair. We know this.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Despair breeds violence. We know this.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to make friends out of potential enemies

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
than to defend yourself against them later?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that cannot be won by military might alone,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
maybe we should listen.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The problems facing the developing world

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
afford us in the developed world

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We will not only transform other people's lives,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Don't you think that on a purely commercial level,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
for Western ingenuity and technology?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Doesn't compassion look well on us?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And let's cut the crap for a second.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is not at its shiniest.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Someone's put a brick through the window.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
The regional branch managers are getting nervous.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Our values: do we have any?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Our credibility?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
These things are under attack around the world.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Brand USA could use some polishing.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I say that as a fan, you know?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
As a person who buys the products.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But think about it.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
More anti-retrovirals make sense.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But equality for Africa --

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that's a big, expensive idea.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What on earth can we all do about this?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, much more than we think.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I want to argue, we must.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And because we can, we must.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It is not a theory.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The fact is that ours is the first generation

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we do not have to stand for this.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Applause)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And let me say this without a trace of irony --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Forget the '60s. We can change the world.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I really believe that, the people in this room.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Look at the Gates Foundation.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But working together, we can actually change the world.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We can turn the inevitable outcomes,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and transform the quality of life for millions of lives

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
who look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(Laughter)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in earlier, headier days.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Ideas that you gestated in your youth.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
This is what excites me.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
This room was born for this moment,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
is really what I want to say to you tonight.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Most of you did, the digital world.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Well, now, actually because of you,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
it is possible to change the physical world.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's a fact.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
we've got to do something about it.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It is a pain in the arse.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But for the first time in history, we have the technology;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
we have the know-how; we have the cash;

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
we have the life-saving drugs.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Do we have the will?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I do not have flowers in my hair.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Actually, I come from punk rock.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But I know toughness when I see it.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
there was muscle to the movement that started out here.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
But idealism allied with pragmatism,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And it's very present in a crowd like you.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
we launched a campaign to summon this spirit

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We're calling it the ONE Campaign.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It's based on our belief that the action of one person

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
can change a lot,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but the actions of many coming together as one

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
can change the world.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
We believe this is one.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
This could be the time that we finally get serious

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Momentum has been building.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Lurching a little, but it's building.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
This year is a test for us all,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
especially the leaders of the G8 nations,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
who really are on the line here,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
with all the world in history watching.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
They started out with such promise on Africa.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They made some really great promises,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But some of them they haven't.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But my disappointment has much more perspective

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
when I talk to American people,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and I hear their worries about the deficit,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and the fiscal well being of their country.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I understand that.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
if we got organized.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
is that aid for Africa is just great value for money

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
at a time when America really needs it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Putting it in the crassest possible terms,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the investment reaps huge returns.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and security that we'll gain.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
(Laughter)

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
by America and by the world.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Give them permission, if you like,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
to spend their political capital and your financial capital,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
That's really what I would like you to do.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Because we also need your intellectual capital:

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
or at least revolutionized the way that they're used.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and pushed the boundaries.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And we'd like you to give us that energy.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
As I say, there're two things on the line here.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
There's the continent Africa.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But there's also our sense of ourselves.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
People are starting to figure this out.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Movements are springing up.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
A lot of people are getting together, and working

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I think they just have one idea in their mind,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
which is, where you live in the world

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
should not determine whether you live in the world.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
(Applause)

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
History, like God, is watching what we do.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
When the history books get written,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I think our age will be remembered for three things.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The digital revolution, yes.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
The war against terror, yes.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(Applause)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Okay, my three wishes.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
The ones that TED has offered to grant.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
that the digital world you all created has uncoupled

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
this should be a piece of piss.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
(Laughter)

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Most of them impossible, some of them impractical

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
and one or two of them certainly immoral.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
(Laughter)

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
when somebody else is picking up the tab.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Anyway, here's number one.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I wish for you to help build a social movement

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
of more than one million American activists for Africa.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
That is my first wish.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I believe it's possible.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You know, there's lots out there.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And with this one campaign as our umbrella,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
my organization, DATA, and other groups,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
We just need your help in making it happen.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
We want all of you here, church America, corporate America,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
we're not going to be denied.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
We will have the ear of Congress.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and right into the Oval Office.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
who are ready to make phone calls,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
who are ready to be on email,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I am absolutely sure that we can actually change

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Right, my second wish, number two.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
who is living on less than one dollar a day.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
That's one billion media hits.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Could be on Google, could be on AOL.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Steve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
It could be NBC. It could be ABC.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I really believe that old Truman line,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
that if you give the American people the facts,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
they'll do the right thing.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
(Video): One by one they step forward,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
and lives are saved.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
The problem is enormous.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Every three seconds one person dies.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Another three seconds, one more.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Asia, even America,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
are uniting as one, acting as one.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
But we need your help.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
One more person, letter, voice

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
will mean the difference between life and death

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
for millions of people.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Please join us by working together.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
We can make history.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
We can start to make poverty history.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
One, by one, by one.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Please visit ONE at this address.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
in one African country.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And I would like it to be Ethiopia.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
every health clinic, every hospital --

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
we can connect to the Internet.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
That is my wish, my third wish.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I think it's possible.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
It's actually where it all started for me.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
can transform a country -- and a continent

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
that has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
But it didn't start out that way.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
The first long-distance line from Boston to New York

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
was used in 1885 on the phone.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Since then, not that much has changed.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
is actually about seven or eight years.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I know how important talking is.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Nurses getting better training,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
pharmacists being able to order supplies,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Thank you very much once again.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
(Applause)
