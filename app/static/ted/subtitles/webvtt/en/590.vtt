00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they're not brothers. (Laughter)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And they were a lot of fun.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Laughter)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The thing about their work

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is that most people come to the door of furniture --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I suspect you probably recognize this chair

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and some of the others I'm going to show you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Video: This is the land.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It has many contrasts.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It is rough and it is flat.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In places it is cold.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In some it is hot.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Too much rain falls on some areas,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and not enough on others.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But people live on this land.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And, as in Russia,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
they are drawn together into towns and cities.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Here is something of the way they live.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Eames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And it was at the height of the Cold War.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
happened about 50 feet from where this was shown.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And yet, how did it start?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You know, commonality, the first line

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in Charles' narration was,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
"The same stars that shine down on Russia

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
shine down on the United States. From the sky,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
our cities look much the same."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you can imagine, and the thing about it is,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
because the important thing was to get the gestalt

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of what the images were about.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So that was just a little snip.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But the thing about Charles and Ray

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is that they were always modeling stuff.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They were always trying things out.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm passionate about my work,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but on top of all that I'm passionate

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
about a holistic vision of design,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
where design is a life skill, not a professional skill.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm no exception.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And Charles just checking it out there.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So now we're going to go through that door of furniture.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is an unusual installation of airport seating.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
was essentially that of a good host,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
anticipating the needs of the guest.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It's just the things you try out

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to kind of make it work better.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It was that hands-on iterative process

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which is so much like vernacular design

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and folk design in traditional cultures.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The other thing that's kind of cool is that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you look at this and in the media when people say design,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they actually mean style.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And I'm really here to talk about design.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But you know the object is just a pivot.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It's a pivot between a process and a system.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And this is a little film I made

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
about the making of the Eames lounge chair.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The design process for Charles and Ray

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
never ended in manufacturing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's not enough to create one.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You've got to create a system that will work better and better.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So I've always liked this prototype picture.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You try things out.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is a relatively famous chair.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Its early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It worked better: "H" base, much more practical.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
This is something called a splint.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
work for the military, or for the soldiers,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And they'd been working on furniture before.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which was incredibly important to them.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm trying to show you too much,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now look at that plastic chair.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The house is 1949.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The chair is done in 1949.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Charles and Ray,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
They focused on the need.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
They tried to solve the design problem.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Charles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's kind of a brutal quote.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This is the earlier design of that house.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Here's a film we've been hearing things about.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
If we watch the next clip,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
you're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The familiar one on the lower right.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The Eames' film Tops, lower left.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Video: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
These form part of a grouping system

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
much as the stars do.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They are so many and so varied that from this distance

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
they appear like the stars from Earth.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I want to give you one example.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So here is the tiny creature.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Modeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And I think in our family we were very lucky,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because we learned about design backwards.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Design was not something other.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It was part of the business of life in general.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It was part of the quality of life.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And here is some family pictures.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But anyway, (Laughter)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So we're going to watch another film.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This is a film, the one called Toys.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They are often the precursor to bigger things.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And these ideas -- that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
is totally the same

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
as the honest use of materials in the plywood.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And now I'm going to test you.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So can you read it?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Lucia angel,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
okay, eye.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Audience: Saw many trains.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
ED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Dawn, very good.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Also rode on one. I ...

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Audience: You had, I hope you had --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
in the late, in the mid-1930's,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
then you'd know that was a Great Dane.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, I hope you had a

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Audience: Nice time, time --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
ED: Time at.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Citizen Kane, rose --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Audience: Rosebud.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
ED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Audience: Party. Love.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
ED: Okay, good.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So you guys did pretty good, cool.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So my mom and Charles had this great relationship

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And it's all part of the, you know,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
These are some images from a project of mine

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that's called Kymaerica.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's sort of an alternative universe.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
We're about to do six in the U.K. next week.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Video: Kymaerica with waterfalls,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
tumbling through our --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
ED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Video: Your word is N. Carolina.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
because in the Kymaerican story

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
fictional experience there.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And the town has really embraced it.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
as inevitable. And it's not.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They have trading cards

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and all sorts of cool things.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
A guy named Nobu Naga,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the so-called Japanese Columbus.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But now I'm going to return you to the real world.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which is the first film that Charles ever made.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Silent. We don't have a track for it yet.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And you try something out.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But here is what's really great.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
See that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
At the same time that Charles was doing that chair,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
he was doing this film.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
of design, was with them from the beginning.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now we're going to do some movies."

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
it's not about just doing one thing.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
between design, business and the world.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So we're going to do the last clip.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So this is Charles' voice.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Charles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
eat very often, particularly in southern India,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
they eat off of a banana leaf.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And those a little bit up the scale

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
on a thing they call a thali.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
If you're up the scale a little bit more,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
why, a brass thali.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And then things get to be a little questionable.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
There are things like silver-plated thalis.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And there is solid silver thalis.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And I suppose some nut has had a

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
gold thali that he's eaten off of.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But you can go beyond that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And the guys that have not only means,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And I think that in these times

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
when we fall back and regroup,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that somehow or other,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the banana leaf parable

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
sort of got to get working there,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
because I'm not prepared to say

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that the banana leaf that one eats off of

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is the same as the other eats off of.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But it is that process that has happened within the man

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
that changes the banana leaf.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
ED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Because that's part of where we've got to get to.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And I also want to share this one.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And I really think that's where we are.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And part of why this stuff is important

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and all the things that we do are important,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is that these are the ideas we need.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
That's what we all need to do.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
All that great thinking needs to really get about solving

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
pretty key problems.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I really thank you for your time.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
(Applause)
