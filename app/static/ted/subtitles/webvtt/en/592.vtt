00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I normally teach courses on

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
how to rebuild states after war.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a picture of my family,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we're actually Cambodians.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to explain the Khmer Rouge regime

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
during 1975 and 1979.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Video: April 17th, 1975.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The communist Khmer Rouge

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and American bombing campaigns.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Led by peasant-born Pol Pot,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in order to create a rural communist utopia,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In a country of only seven million people,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Sophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
on April 17th 1975

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we lived in Phnom Penh.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because they're easy to bring into wars.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
more munitions that fell on Cambodia

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
than in all of World War II Japan,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
including the two nuclear bombs

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of August 1945.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in Cambodia was bombed.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But not just that, they actually banned money.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I think it's the only precedent in which

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
money has ever been stopped from being used.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And we know money is the root of all evil,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
where rice growing takes place.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So my father and mother ended up in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a sort of concentration camp, labor camp.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And it was at that time that my mother got word

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
from the commune chief

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that the Vietnamese were actually asking

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And she spoke some Vietnamese,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that she would take the chance

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and claim to be Vietnamese

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
so that we could have a chance to survive,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And they're giving about --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And at about this time actually

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
my father got very sick.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And he didn't speak Vietnamese.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So he died actually, in January 1976.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And it made it possible, in fact,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
for us to take on this plan.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So the Khmer Rouge took us

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which is across from the border from Vietnam.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And there they had a detention camp

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that to make our story more credible,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But she'd given the boys girls' names,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and the girls boys' names.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that she was able to go into her exam

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And then onwards to Chau Doc.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But for us it meant freedom.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Last year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
started, and I decided that as a matter of record

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I should file a Civil Complaint

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And I got word last month

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And she was able to return to a place

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that for her meant freedom, but also fear,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
because we had just come out of Cambodia.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
She's here today with us in the audience.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Thank you mother.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Applause)
