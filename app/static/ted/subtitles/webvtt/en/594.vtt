00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So it was about four years ago, five years ago,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with a bag similar to this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but your body knows it extremely well.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Actually our body doesn't hate these.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Our body loves these. It eats them.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
on the cell, it means "that's food."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
immune response to this ridiculous molecule

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But I said we can't get rid of it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
found out you can't get rid of that immunity.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And I said, why don't you use that?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What if I could stick this molecule,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
slap it onto a bacteria

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean I could immediately tap into

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
an immune response that was already there,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then charges you for possession of marijuana.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
(Laughter)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So you can take a bacteria

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that really doesn't make these things at all,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and if you could clamp these on it really well

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you have it taken off the street.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And for certain bacteria

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Our antibiotics are running out.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because we won't be here. But if we are --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So I started working with this thing,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
with a bunch of collaborators.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And trying to attach this to things that were

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
themselves attached to certain specific target zones,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
bacteria that we don't like.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And I feel now like George Bush.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's like "mission accomplished."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
sort of symbolizing this right now.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to a target that you have selected for it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and will alert your immune system to go after it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Here's what happened. See that line on the very top

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
with the little dots?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
by our scientist friends down in Texas,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that would attack anthrax in particular,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and direct your immune system to it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that's a 100 percent survival rate.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And they actually lived another 14 days,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
or 28 when we finally killed them,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Why did they not die?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So we did it. Okay?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
(Applause)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Mission accomplished!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Applause)
