00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Because of what I'm about to say,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I really should establish my green credentials.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the natural resources of my country,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I've stuck to that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so it's the same now, 30 years later,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
called Whole Earth Discipline.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The dominant demographic event of our time

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is this screamingly rapid urbanization

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that we have going on.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and that's mostly in the developing world,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where that's happening.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
by the size of cities.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and nine times bigger.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's qualitatively different.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well we now have a distribution of urban power

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In other words, the rise of the West,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
dramatic as it was, is over.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
1.3 million people a week coming to town,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
decade after decade.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What's really going on?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
People are following opportunity into town.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And this is why.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and it's because I never lived in one.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
(Laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Because in town --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
this is the bustling squatter city

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of Kibera, near Nairobi --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
they see action. They see opportunity.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
back in the subsistence farm.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There is plenty going on.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The aggregate numbers now

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
are that basically squatters,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which means they're building the world --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
personally, one by one, family by family,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They even build their own infrastructure.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And then gradually gentrifies.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
These people are valuable as a group.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And that's how they work.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Famine mostly is a rural event now.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There are things they care about.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And this is where we can help.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And the nations they're in can help.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And they are helping each other solve these issues.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You look at that lane on the right.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The answer is, "Everything."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's much more interactive.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And the scale is terrific.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
These are people busy getting out of poverty

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
just as fast as they can.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They're helping each other do it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
They're doing it through an outlaw thing,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the informal economy.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Furthermore, people in the informal economy,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the gray economy --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
as time goes by,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
or they can join the legitimate world.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We should be able to make that choice

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
There's all kinds of activity.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In Dharavi the slum performs not only

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
a lot of services for itself,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but it performs services for the city at large.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
to a private, tiny, unofficial school.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So one thing slammed up against another,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
such as in Sao Paulo here.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
is by slamming things together.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
In this case, supply right next to demand.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that live in this lively part of town on the left

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Proximity is amazing.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Connectivity between the city and the country

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is what's going to keep the country good,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is what makes cities --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Applause)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
of subsistence farms, and head to town.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And when they're gone the natural environment

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
starts to come back very rapidly.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to send food to the new growing markets in town.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
More than half.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Another billion is expected.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And that will determine a lot of how we function.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now, for us environmentalists,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
People get into town.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The immediately have fewer children.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and the birthrate goes down radically.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Very interesting side effect here,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
here's a slide from Phillip Longman.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Shows what is happening.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
As we have more and more old people, like me,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and fewer and fewer babies.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And they are regionally separated.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
What you're getting is a world which is

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
in the north.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
doing new things, in the south.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Where do you think the action is going to be?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
than we think, faster than we think.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
full of runaway positive feedbacks,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Here's just a few samples.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the surprises are going to be bad ones.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
From your standpoint this means

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
a great increase in climate refugees

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
over the coming decades,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and chaos wars,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
as we're seeing in Darfur.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That's what drought does.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It brings carrying capacity down,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and there's not enough carrying capacity

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to support the people. And then you're in trouble.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Shift to the power situation.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
or a city planet.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
coal, some gas,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
nuclear and hydro.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And everyone will keep burning it

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So with hydro maxed out,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
coal and lose the climate,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and maybe save the climate.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And if we can eventually get good solar in space,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that also could help.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in the villages and in the cities.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So, between coal and nuclear,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
compare their waste products.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
the amount of waste that would be added up

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
would fit in a Coke can.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Whereas a coal-burning plant,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
each car having 100 tons.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And it puts 18 thousand tons

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
of carbon dioxide in the air.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
of these various energy forms,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
nuclear is about even with solar and wind,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and ahead of solar --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And does nuclear really compete with coal?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Just ask the coal miners in Australia.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
That's where you see some of the source,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
not from my fellow environmentalists,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Well the good news is that

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This is good for the atmosphere.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It's good for their prosperity.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I want to point out one interesting thing,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and good things like that.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
might serve even better.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And they're selling these floating reactors,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
25 million watts,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and you compare it to the standard big iron

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Here's another American design that came out

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They're typically buried in the ground.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In terms of proliferation,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
nuclear energy has done more

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
20 percent of electricity

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
in this room is probably nuclear.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And I was glad to see that president Obama

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
when he spoke in Prague the other week.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
in my view, as a biologist,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
have no reason to be controversial.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Despite their best efforts,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
genetically engineered crops are the most

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
which leaves the soil in place,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
getting healthier from year to year --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
into the atmosphere.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They reduce pesticide use.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
agricultural area be smaller,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and therefore more wild area is freed up.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
By the way, this map from 2006

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
is out of date because it shows Africa

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
still under the thumb of Greenpeace,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and Friends of the Earth from Europe,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and they're finally getting out from under that.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
This is a moral issue.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
met on this issue twice in great detail

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and said it is a moral imperative

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to make genetically engineered crops readily available.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
especially in government circles,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but it will be on your plate --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
not this year but pretty soon,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because some harsh realizations are coming along.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is a list of them.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
There will be events,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
which happened a while back.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Like wars over water,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
such as in the Indus.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And as those events keep happening

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But there's this little problem with geoengineering:

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
what body is going to decide

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Because everybody is downstream,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
downwind of whatever is done.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And if we just taboo it completely

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
we could lose civilization.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But if we just say "OK,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
China, you're worried, you go ahead.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I should say, it is more practical than people think.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
This one came from the sulfur dioxide

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
cooled the earth by half a degree.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
That's nothing, compared to all of the other

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
things we may be trying to do about energy.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Just to run by another one:

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
by atomizing seawater;

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
A nice one, because it can happen

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
lots of little ways in lots of little places,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
who made good agricultural soil

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
while it's improving the soil.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So here is where we are.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
calls our geological era the Anthropocene,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
the human-dominated era. We are stuck

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
with its obligations.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Thank you.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
(Applause)
