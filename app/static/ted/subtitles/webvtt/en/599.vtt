00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a studio in Berlin --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
let me cue on here --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I have occasional meetings with scientists.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have an annual gathering of people,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and that is called Life in Space.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Life in Space is really not necessarily about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
how we do things, but why we do things.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Do you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
by overlapping what I say and what you say --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
think of a movie.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Since two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I've been working on these films

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
where we produce the film together.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But nevertheless, what the potential is --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and just keep looking there --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
what the potential is, obviously,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is to kind of move the border of who is the author,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and who is the receiver.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Who is the consumer, if you want,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and who has responsibility for what one sees?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think there is a socializing dimension

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in, kind of, moving that border.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Who decides what reality is?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is the Tate Modern in London.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The show was, in a sense, about that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And my idea was to make the space tangible.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
With such a big space, the problem is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
obviously that there is a discrepancy

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
between what your body can embrace,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and what the space, in that sense, is.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So look at this. Look at the girl.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Of course they have to look through a bloody camera

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But look at her face there,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
"Oh! That was my foot there!"

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And in that whole idea,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
How do we reconfigure it?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
why, rather than how?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The why meant really,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
"What does it matter?"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
filter into a sense of responsibility?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Is art about that?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I would say yes. It is obviously about

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or even worse, if you ask me.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's obviously also about taking responsibility,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
among other places.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but it obviously looks really rather frightening.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in these different places of the world.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it was really about showing people,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in this city, as they walk by,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that space has dimensions. A space has time.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And the water flows through the city with time.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The water has an ability to make

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the city negotiable, tangible.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
whether you do something or not.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And if I vote it makes a difference.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This whole idea of a city not being a picture is,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I think, something that art, in a sense,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
always was working with.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
between what it means to be in a picture,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The difference between thinking and doing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
These are ongoing experiments.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
One is an experiment I did for BMW,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
an attempt to make a car.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's made out of ice.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
A sort of a run track, or a walk track,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on the top of a museum in Denmark,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which is made of colored glass, going all around.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So the movement with your legs

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
will change the color of your horizon.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
with the Serpentine Gallery:

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
a kind of a temporal pavilion where

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
This summer, in New York:

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
there is one thing about falling water which is very much about

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the time it takes for water to fall.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's quite simple and fundamental.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And as you come to a new valley,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
If you stand still, the landscape

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The big mountains far away, they move less.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And if you stop again, you wonder,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
"Is that a one-hour valley?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
If you have a waterfall in there,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
If a waterfall is falling faster,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And your body somehow knows that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Of course being an iconic city like New York,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that has had an interest in somehow

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
wants to seem as big as possible.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Adding a measurement

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to that is interesting:

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the falling water suddenly gives you a sense

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
the lower East River is this big."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And why would we want to do that?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Because I think it makes a difference

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
whether you have a body

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that feels a part of a space,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Is there a sense of consequences?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So if I have a sense of the space,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
if I feel that the space is tangible,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
if I feel there is time,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
if there is a dimension I could call time,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I also feel that I can change the space.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And suddenly it makes a difference

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
in terms of making space accessible.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
One could say this is about

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
community, collectivity.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's about being together.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
How do we create public space?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So, asked in that way,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I think it raises great things about

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
being together, being individual.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
How do we create

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and also to collectivity,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
without polarizing the two

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
into two different opposites?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Of course the political agendas in the world

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
into different, very normative ideas.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I would claim that art and culture,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in the times we're living in now,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
have proven that one can

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
create a kind of a space

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
which is both sensitive to individuality

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and to collectivity.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's very much about this causality, consequences.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's very much about the way we link

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
thinking and doing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So what is between thinking and doing?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And right in-between thinking and doing,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I would say, there is experience.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And experience is not just

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Experience is about responsibility.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Having an experience is taking part in the world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So art, in that sense,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I think holds an incredible relevance

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in the world in which we're moving into,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
particularly right now.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
That's all I have. Thank you very much.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
