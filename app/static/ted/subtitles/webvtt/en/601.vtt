00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I didn't bring a human brain,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And bone marrow is actually what we use

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and some other diseases.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who is a volunteer donor.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of a child with leukemia.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and another doctor across from me.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you know, not too big.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the way we do this is we basically

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
place this through the soft tissue,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
each time, with a syringe.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
About 200 times usually.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
let alone Bob,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
whose rear end looks something more like this,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
like Swiss cheese.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And there is probably a better way to do this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Our standard see-through patient.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And we have a flexible, powered catheter

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
No robots required.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and do this harvest as an outpatient.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And played around with this a little bit.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And our team members developed this technology.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
than the standard approach done on the same patient.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You all know about embryonic stem cells.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
for over 40 years.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
such as heart disease, vascular disease,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
orthopedics, tissue engineering,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and diabetes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which translates to better outcomes.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It may encourage more people to sign up to be

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It may even enable you to bank

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to use in the future should you need it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
bone marrow transplant survivors,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Hopefully this technology will let us

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
have more of these survivors in the future.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Thanks.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
(Applause)
