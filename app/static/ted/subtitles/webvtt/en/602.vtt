00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And over the past 35 years,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've studied behavior

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
on the basis of everything from genes

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
all the way through circuit analysis.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So that's what I normally do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But then, for some reason,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I got into something else, just recently.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to analyze a bunch of brains

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of psychopathic killers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so this would be the typical talk I would give.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What I mean by psychopathic killer

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
are these people, these types of people.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so some of the brains that I've studied

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
are people you know about.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So I've looked at about 70 of these.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we look at these sorts of things theoretically,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on the basis of genetics,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and brain damage, and interaction with environment,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and exactly how that machine works.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we're interested in exactly where in the brain,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and what's the most important part of the brain.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So we've been looking at this:

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the interaction of genes,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what's called epigenetic effects,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
brain damage, and environment,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and how these are tied together.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
depends on exactly when the damage occurs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's really a very precisely timed thing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You get different kinds of psychopaths.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
who was a murderer, and was a serial killer,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
had damage to their orbital cortex,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which is right above the eyes, the orbits,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So there is the pattern that every one of them had,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but they all were a little different too.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They had other sorts of brain damage.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
A key thing is that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the major violence genes,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it's called the MAO-A gene.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you can only get it from your mother.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
are psychopathic killers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or are very aggressive.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Because a daughter can get one X from the father,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But for a son, he can only get

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the X chromosome from his mother.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
which is kind of interesting because serotonin

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But if you have this gene, in utero

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
your brain is bathed in this,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so it doesn't work later on in life.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I'd given this one talk in Israel,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
just this past year.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it does have some consequences.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Theoretically what this means

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is that in order to express this gene,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
in a violent way,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
very early on, before puberty,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
not a little stress, not being spanked or something,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but really seeing violence,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or being involved in it, in 3D.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And so, if you have that gene,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and you see a lot of violence

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
in a certain situation,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
where we have constant violence,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you end up having generations of kids

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that are seeing all this violence.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And now the boys and the girls get them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So I think after several generations,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So that was the idea.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
about psychopathic killers.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And you're talking as if you come from a normal family."

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I said, "What the hell are you talking about?"

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
She then told me about our own family tree.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but my father did.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Well she said, "There is good news and bad news.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And the first murder

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of a mother by a son

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and how people thought back then.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But it doesn't stop there.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There were seven more men, on my father's side,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Okay, now this gives one a little pause.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Because my father himself,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and my three uncles, in World War II,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
were all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and we're kind of due.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So the moral of the story is:

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But more likely is this.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
(Laughter)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And they all seemed to be OK.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of everybody in the family.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Laughter)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to see where the bad news is.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now the only person -- it turns out

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
one son and one daughter, siblings,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And now they are close as can be.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So that's my talk.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)
