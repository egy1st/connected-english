00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.000
Interestingly, Charles Darwin

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
was born a very lightly pigmented man,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Over the course of his life,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Darwin had great privilege.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He lived in a fairly wealthy home.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And when he was in his 20s

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
he embarked upon a remarkable voyage 
on the ship the Beagle.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And during the course of that voyage,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
he saw remarkable things:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the observations that he made

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
on that epic journey

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
were to be eventually distilled

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
published 150 years ago.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now what is so interesting

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
about "The Origin of Species,"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is that there is only one line in it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
about human evolution.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
"Light will be thrown on the origin of man

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and his history."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It wasn't until much longer,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
much later,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that Darwin actually spoke

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and wrote about humans.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now in his years of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
traveling on the Beagle,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and from listening to the accounts

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or explorers and naturalists,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
he knew that skin color

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
was one of the most important ways

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in which people varied.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
were found close to the equator;

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
lightly pigmented peoples, like himself,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
were found closer to the poles.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what did he make of all this?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But much later, in 1871,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
he did have something to say about it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it was quite curious. He said,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
"Of all the differences between the races of men,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the color of the skin is the most conspicuous

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and one of the best marked."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And he went on to say,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
"These differences do not coincide

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
with corresponding differences in climate."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So he had traveled all around.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He had seen people of different colors

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
living in different places.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And yet he rejected the idea

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that human skin pigmentation

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
was related to the climate.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If only Darwin lived today.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If only Darwin had NASA.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is it puts up a variety of satellites

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And for many decades now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
there have been a series of TOMS satellites

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
show the annual average

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now the really hot pink and red areas

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of UV during the year.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The incrementally cooler colors --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is in these cool gray zones.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This has tremendous implications for our understanding

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And what Darwin could not appreciate,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is that there was a fundamental relationship

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and skin pigmentation.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And that skin pigmentation itself

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
was a product of evolution.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And so when we look at a map of skin color,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and predicted skin color, as we know it today,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
what we see is a beautiful gradient

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the lightest ones toward the poles.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What's very, very important here

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
is that the earliest humans

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
evolved in high-UV environments,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in equatorial Africa.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The earliest members of our lineage,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And we all share this incredible heritage

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of having originally been

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
darkly pigmented,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
two million to one and half million years ago.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now what happened in our history?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Let's first look at the relationship

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
In those early days of our evolution,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
looking at the equator,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The UVC, the most energetic type,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But UVB and UVA

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
especially, came in unimpeded.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's very destructive,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
for our strong bones, the health of our immune system,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and myriad other important functions in our bodies.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, living at the equator, we got

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and the melanin --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
compound in our skin --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
served as a superb natural sunscreen.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
This polymer is amazing

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
because it's present in so many different organisms.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a billion years,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and has been recruited over and over again

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
by evolution, as often happens.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Why change it if it works?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and specifically in our earliest ancestors

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
evolving in Africa,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to be a natural sunscreen.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Where it protected the body

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the destruction, or damage to DNA,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
which helps to fuel cell production,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and reproduction in the body.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
wonderful covering of melanin.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
But then we moved.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
from Africa into other parts of the Old World,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and most recently, into the New World.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
When humans dispersed into these latitudes,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
what did they face?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Conditions were significantly colder,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but they were also less intense

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
with respect to the ultraviolet regime.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We're still getting a dose of UVA.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But all of the UVB,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or nearly all of it,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
you may experience ultraviolet radiation.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But it's all UVA,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and, significantly, that UVA

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
were bereft of the potential

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This had tremendous consequences

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
these lineages of people

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
lost their pigmentation.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
There was natural selection

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Here we begin to see the evolution

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of the beautiful sepia rainbow

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that now characterizes all of humanity.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
not just twice, but probably three times.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Not just in modern humans,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the Neanderthals.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
A remarkable, remarkable testament

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to the power of evolution.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Humans have been on the move for a long time.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And just in the last 5,000 years,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in increasing rates, over increasing distances.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
people from high UV areas

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
going to low UV and vice versa.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And not all these moves were voluntary.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Between 1520 and 1867,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
12 million, 500 people

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
were moved from high UV

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
to low UV areas

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in the transatlantic slave trade.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But it also had deleterious

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
health consequences to people.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So what? We've been on the move.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
We're so clever we can overcome all of these

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
seeming biological impediments.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, often we're unaware

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
of the fact that we're living

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in environments in which our skin

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
is inherently poorly adapted.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
live in high-UV areas.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
live in low-UV areas.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
These have tremendous consequences for our health.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We have to, if we're lightly pigmented,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
be careful about the problems of skin cancer,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and destruction of folate in our bodies,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
by lots of sun.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Epidemiologists and doctors

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
have been very good about telling us

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
about protecting our skin.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
What they haven't been so good about instructing people

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is the problem of darkly pigmented people

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
living in high latitude areas,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
or working inside all the time.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Because the problem there is just as severe,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but it is more sinister,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
because vitamin D deficiency,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is a major problem.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to their gradual decay of their immune systems,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
or loss of immune function,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and probably some problems

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
with their mood and health,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
their mental health.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So we have, in skin pigmentation,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
one of these wonderful products of evolution

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that still has consequences for us today.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And the social consequences,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
as we know, are incredibly profound.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We live in a world where we

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
have lightly and darkly pigmented people

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
living next to one another,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but often brought into proximity initially

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
as a result of very invidious social interactions.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So how can we overcome this?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
How can we begin to understand it?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Evolution helps us.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
200 years after Darwin's birthday,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Applause)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
How wonderful is that?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
(Applause)

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But we need to think about how he compares,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
He, as one of many urban admixed populations,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is very emblematic

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And he resembles, very closely,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
people with moderate levels of pigmentation

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
These people have a tremendous potential

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
as a result of exposure to sun.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
if they have desk jobs, like that guy.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So lets all wish for his great health,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now what is wonderful

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
about the evolution of human skin pigmentation,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and the phenomenon of pigmentation,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
is that it is the demonstration,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the evidence, of evolution

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
by natural selection,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
right on your body.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
You just have to look at your skin.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
even though he eschewed the importance

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I think, were he able to look

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
He would appreciate it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And most of all, he would teach it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You, you can teach it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You can touch it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You can understand it.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Take it out of this room.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Take your skin color,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and celebrate it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Spread the word.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You have the evolution

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
of the history of our species,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
part of it, written in your skin.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You are the products of evolution.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Thank you.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
(Applause)
