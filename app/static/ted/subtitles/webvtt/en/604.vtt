WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Can I say how delighted I am to be away

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
her back ruined by napalm,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to begin to end the Vietnam War.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who launched Live Aid in the 1980s,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is Tiananmen Square.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A man before a tank became a picture

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This next is the Sudanese girl,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a few moments from death,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
a vulture hovering in the background,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a picture that went round the world

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and shocked people into action on poverty.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is Neda, the Iranian girl

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of the YouTube generation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And what do all these pictures and events have in common?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What they have in common is what we see unlocks

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
what we cannot see.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What we see unlocks the invisible ties

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and bonds of sympathy that bring us together

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to become a human community.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What these pictures demonstrate is that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we do feel the pain of others,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
however distantly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What I think these pictures demonstrate

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What these pictures demonstrate is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
across all continents -- a moral sense that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
not only do we share the pain of others,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and believe in something bigger than ourselves

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but we have a duty to act when we see things

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that are wrong that need righted,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
see injuries that need to be corrected,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
see problems that need to be rectified.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said --

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"Isn’t this man a communist?"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!"

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to realize their potential to the full.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that commands attention from people of every religion

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and every faith, and people of no faith.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to communicate instantaneously across frontiers

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
right across the world.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We now have the capacity to find common ground

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with people who we will never meet,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but who we will meet through the Internet and through

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
all the modern means of communication;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that we now have the capacity to organize

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and take collective action together

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to deal with the problem or an injustice

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that we want to deal with;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and it is the start of what I would call

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the creation of a truly global society.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
They protested across Britain.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They won public opinion over a long period of time.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
if they were able to use the modern means of communication

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to win people’s hearts and minds?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
who were part of the defeated families of Austria,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that in Britain she wanted to take action,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but she had to go house to house,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
in the Royal Albert Hall

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that eventually gave birth to Save the Children,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
an international organization that is now fully recognized

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But what more could she have done

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to create a sense that the injustice that people saw

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
had to be acted upon immediately?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
told the world that there was a repression,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
meaning that lives were being lost

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
had to be listened to.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
following what happened to Neda,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
changing their address to Tehran, Iran,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and making it difficult for the security services.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and our ability to organize internationally.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
to fundamentally change the world.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
who are communicating with each other around the world.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
was how young people, children, had the right to education.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
all these have come under pressure

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
(Laughter)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and he summarized the challenge for us all.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that needed global solutions

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and needed the creation of a truly global society.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Combine the power of a global ethic

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
with the power of our ability to communicate

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
most of which are global in their nature.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Climate change cannot be solved in one country,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but has got to be solved by the world working together.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
by America alone or Europe alone;

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
it needed the world to work together.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
the problem of human rights and development:

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
they cannot be solved by Africa alone;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and our global ability to communicate

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and organize together, a truly global society,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
built on that ethic but with institutions

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that can serve that global society and make for a different future.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that we have a situation

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
where we know that there is a climate change problem,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
to the poorest countries to deal with that,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
when we want to create a global carbon market,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but there is no global institution

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that people have been able to agree upon

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
to deal with this problem?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
is an agreement that there will be

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
a global environmental institution

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that is able to deal

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
with the problems of persuading the whole of the world

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to move along a climate-change agenda.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Applause)

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is that we have got to persuade people around the world

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to change their behavior as well,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
across the generations.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Take the financial crisis.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
If people can find that that sub-prime product

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
has been transferred across nations

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
or the rest in Britain,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and people's ordinary savings are affected by it,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
for jobs, as well as for financial stability,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
global economic institutions that make sure

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that growth to be sustained has to be shared,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and are built on the principle

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
not the ideas that were the basis

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and a global society that can be done.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
This is a country of six and a half million people,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it has 120 midwives.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
with such limited resources.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
a girl called Miriam.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
her mother and then her father.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
She was an AIDS orphan being handed

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
across different extended families to be cared for.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
She herself was suffering from HIV;

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
she was suffering from tuberculosis.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is looking forward to the future,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
the poorest countries

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Take the problems of human rights and

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the problems of security in so many countries around the world.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
for wars that we could prevent.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
In the Rwanda Children's Museum,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
There is a photograph of a boy called David.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It said "David, age 10."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
David: ambition to be a doctor.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Making people laugh.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
How did he die?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Tortured to death.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And we never did.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And that young boy believed our promises

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and we never did.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So we have got to create in this world also

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
but also for reconstruction and security

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So my argument today is basically this.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
for these institutions to work,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
but we should not lose the chance in this generation,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
with other people working with us around the world,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to create global institutions for the environment,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and for finance,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and for security and for development,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
our desire to bind the world together, and

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But it is said that in Ancient Greece

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech."

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
They said, "Let's march."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We should be marching towards a global society.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Thank you.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
(Applause)
