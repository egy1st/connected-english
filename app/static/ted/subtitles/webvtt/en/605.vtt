00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:02.984
For me they normally happen,
these career crises,

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.555
often, actually, on a Sunday evening,

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.452
just as the sun is starting to set,

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:12.134
and the gap between my hopes for myself
and the reality of my life

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:13.976
starts to diverge so painfully

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.976
that I normally end up
weeping into a pillow.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.505
I'm mentioning all this --

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.212
I'm mentioning all this because I think
this is not merely a personal problem;

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:23.772
you may think I'm wrong in this,

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:27.379
but I think we live in an age
when our lives are regularly punctuated

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.545
by career crises, by moments
when what we thought we knew --

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.379
about our lives, about our careers --

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:35.832
comes into contact
with a threatening sort of reality.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:39.609
It's perhaps easier now than ever before
to make a good living.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.976
It's perhaps harder than ever before

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.976
to stay calm, to be free
of career anxiety.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.389
I want to look now, if I may,
at some of the reasons

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:51.976
why we might be feeling
anxiety about our careers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.239
Why we might be victims
of these career crises,

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:58.209
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.976
One of the reasons
why we might be suffering

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.558
is that we are surrounded by snobs.

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.976
In a way, I've got some bad news,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.762
particularly to anybody
who's come to Oxford from abroad.

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:10.564
There's a real problem with snobbery,

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:12.754
because sometimes people
from outside the U.K.

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:15.485
imagine that snobbery
is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.976
fixated on country houses and titles.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.664
The bad news is that's not true.

00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:22.664
Snobbery is a global phenomenon;
we are a global organization,

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:24.045
this is a global phenomenon.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.704
What is a snob?

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:29.037
A snob is anybody who takes
a small part of you,

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:32.426
and uses that to come
to a complete vision of who you are.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.976
That is snobbery.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.325
The dominant kind of snobbery
that exists nowadays is job snobbery.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.596
You encounter it within minutes
at a party, when you get asked

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.787
that famous iconic question
of the early 21st century,

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:45.984
"What do you do?"

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.009
According to how you answer that question,

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.367
people are either incredibly
delighted to see you,

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.573
or look at their watch
and make their excuses.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:53.613
(Laughter)

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:55.976
Now, the opposite of a snob
is your mother.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.976
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.977
Not necessarily your mother,
or indeed mine,

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.636
but, as it were, the ideal mother,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.008
somebody who doesn't care
about your achievements.

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:07.230
Unfortunately, most people
are not our mothers.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.072
Most people make a strict correlation
between how much time,

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.489
and if you like, love --

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:13.976
not romantic love,
though that may be something --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.295
but love in general, respect --
they are willing to accord us,

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.976
that will be strictly defined
by our position in the social hierarchy.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.239
And that's a lot of the reason
why we care so much about our careers

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:27.976
and indeed start caring
so much about material goods.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.239
You know, we're often told
that we live in very materialistic times,

00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:32.976
that we're all greedy people.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.286
I don't think we are
particularly materialistic.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.738
I think we live in a society which has
simply pegged certain emotional rewards

00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:41.974
to the acquisition of material goods.

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:44.928
It's not the material goods we want;
it's the rewards we want.

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:46.960
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.

00:02:46.984 --> 00:02:49.945
The next time you see somebody
driving a Ferrari, don't think,

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.793
"This is somebody who's greedy."

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:55.535
Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly
vulnerable and in need of love."

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.976
(Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.403
Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.

00:03:01.427 --> 00:03:02.935
There are other reasons --

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.976
(Laughter)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.922
There are other reasons why it's perhaps
harder now to feel calm than ever before.

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:09.622
One of these, and it's paradoxical,

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:12.156
because it's linked to something
that's rather nice,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.226
is the hope we all have for our careers.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.348
Never before have
expectations been so high

00:03:16.372 --> 00:03:19.095
about what human beings can
achieve with their lifespan.

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.148
We're told, from many sources,
that anyone can achieve anything.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:24.055
We've done away with the caste system,

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.770
we are now in a system where anyone
can rise to any position they please.

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:29.976
And it's a beautiful idea.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.453
Along with that is a kind
of spirit of equality;

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:33.834
we're all basically equal.

00:03:33.858 --> 00:03:37.976
There are no strictly defined hierarchies.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.462
There is one really big problem with this,

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.994
and that problem is envy.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.782
Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:48.286
but if there's one dominant emotion
in modern society, that is envy.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.977
And it's linked to the spirit of equality.

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.152
Let me explain.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:55.437
I think it would be very unusual
for anyone here, or anyone watching,

00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:57.333
to be envious of the Queen of England.

00:03:57.357 --> 00:04:00.594
Even though she is much richer
than any of you are,

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.880
and she's got a very large house,

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:06.562
the reason why we don't envy her
is because she's too weird.

00:04:06.586 --> 00:04:07.594
(Laughter)

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:08.975
She's simply too strange.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.380
We can't relate to her,
she speaks in a funny way,

00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:12.777
she comes from an odd place.

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:14.174
So we can't relate to her,

00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:17.096
and when you can't relate
to somebody, you don't envy them.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.976
The closer two people are --
in age, in background,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.318
in the process of identification --
the more there's a danger of envy,

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:26.817
which is incidentally why none of you
should ever go to a school reunion,

00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:30.940
because there is no stronger reference
point than people one was at school with.

00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:34.502
The problem of modern society is
it turns the whole world into a school.

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.796
Everybody's wearing jeans,
everybody's the same.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.975
And yet, they're not.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.976
So there's a spirit of equality
combined with deep inequality,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.691
which can make for
a very stressful situation.

00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:46.040
It's probably as unlikely
that you would nowadays

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:47.976
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.976
as it was unlikely in the 17th century

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.242
that you would accede to the ranks
of the French aristocracy.

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.314
But the point is,
it doesn't feel that way.

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:58.404
It's made to feel, by magazines
and other media outlets,

00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:02.284
that if you've got energy, a few bright
ideas about technology, a garage --

00:05:02.308 --> 00:05:04.739
you, too, could start a major thing.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.118
(Laughter)

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:09.381
The consequences of this problem
make themselves felt in bookshops.

00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:12.596
When you go to a large bookshop
and look at the self-help sections,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.800
as I sometimes do --

00:05:13.824 --> 00:05:16.910
if you analyze self-help books
produced in the world today,

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.381
there are basically two kinds.

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:22.191
The first kind tells you, "You can do it!
You can make it! Anything's possible!"

00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:26.811
The other kind tells you how to cope with
what we politely call "low self-esteem,"

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:29.462
or impolitely call,
"feeling very bad about yourself."

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:30.976
There's a real correlation

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.976
between a society that tells people
that they can do anything,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.976
and the existence of low self-esteem.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.976
So that's another way in which something
quite positive can have a nasty kickback.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.325
There is another reason why
we might be feeling more anxious --

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.976
about our careers, about our status
in the world today, than ever before.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.048
And it's, again, linked to something nice.

00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:52.770
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.

00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:55.096
Everybody, all politicians
on Left and Right,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.337
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,

00:05:57.361 --> 00:06:01.507
and we should all be trying to make
our societies really, really meritocratic.

00:06:01.531 --> 00:06:04.850
In other words --
what is a meritocratic society?

00:06:04.874 --> 00:06:09.000
A meritocratic society is one in which,
if you've got talent and energy and skill,

00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:11.596
you will get to the top,
nothing should hold you back.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.782
It's a beautiful idea.

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.130
The problem is, if you
really believe in a society

00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:18.822
where those who merit to get
to the top, get to the top,

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.851
you'll also, by implication,
and in a far more nasty way,

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.572
believe in a society where those
who deserve to get to the bottom

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.819
also get to the bottom and stay there.

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:31.191
In other words, your position in life
comes to seem not accidental,

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.976
but merited and deserved.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.976
And that makes failure
seem much more crushing.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.378
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,

00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:40.274
when you met a very poor person,

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:43.162
that person would be described
as an "unfortunate" --

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:46.976
literally, somebody who had not
been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.096
Nowadays, particularly
in the United States,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.263
if you meet someone
at the bottom of society,

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:53.976
they may unkindly be
described as a "loser."

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.976
There's a real difference
between an unfortunate and a loser,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.976
and that shows 400 years
of evolution in society

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.097
and our belief in who
is responsible for our lives.

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.976
It's no longer the gods, it's us.
We're in the driving seat.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.976
That's exhilarating if you're doing well,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.852
and very crushing if you're not.

00:07:09.876 --> 00:07:11.418
It leads, in the worst cases --

00:07:11.442 --> 00:07:14.409
in the analysis of a sociologist
like Emil Durkheim --

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.740
it leads to increased rates of suicide.

00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:19.976
There are more suicides
in developed, individualistic countries

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.741
than in any other part of the world.

00:07:21.765 --> 00:07:23.339
And some of the reason for that

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:26.432
is that people take what happens to them
extremely personally --

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:29.975
they own their success,
but they also own their failure.

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.286
Is there any relief
from some of these pressures

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.647
that I've been outlining?

00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:34.830
I think there is.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.620
I just want to turn to a few of them.

00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:37.976
Let's take meritocracy.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.976
This idea that everybody deserves
to get where they get to,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.808
I think it's a crazy idea,
completely crazy.

00:07:43.832 --> 00:07:46.084
I will support any politician
of Left and Right,

00:07:46.108 --> 00:07:48.402
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.976
I am a meritocrat in that sense.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.672
But I think it's insane to believe

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:55.153
that we will ever make a society
that is genuinely meritocratic;

00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:56.411
it's an impossible dream.

00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:59.896
The idea that we will make a society
where literally everybody is graded,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.816
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.976
exactly done as it
should be, is impossible.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.976
There are simply too many random factors:

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.976
accidents, accidents of birth,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
accidents of things dropping
on people's heads, illnesses, etc.

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.976
We will never get to grade them,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.976
never get to grade people as they should.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.143
I'm drawn to a lovely quote
by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:22.580
where he says, "It's a sin
to judge any man by his post."

00:08:22.604 --> 00:08:24.246
In modern English that would mean

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.994
it's a sin to come to any view
of who you should talk to,

00:08:27.018 --> 00:08:28.601
dependent on their business card.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:30.376
It's not the post that should count.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.180
According to St. Augustine, only God
can really put everybody in their place;

00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:36.339
he's going to do that
on the Day of Judgment,

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:38.745
with angels and trumpets,
and the skies will open.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.276
Insane idea, if you're
a secularist person, like me.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.920
But something very valuable
in that idea, nevertheless.

00:08:43.944 --> 00:08:47.276
In other words, hold your horses
when you're coming to judge people.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.976
You don't necessarily know
what someone's true value is.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.976
That is an unknown part of them,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.195
and we shouldn't behave
as though it is known.

00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:58.020
There is another source of solace
and comfort for all this.

00:08:58.044 --> 00:09:01.169
When we think about failing in life,
when we think about failure,

00:09:01.193 --> 00:09:03.035
one of the reasons why we fear failing

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:05.334
is not just a loss of income,
a loss of status.

00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:08.101
What we fear is the judgment
and ridicule of others.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.278
And it exists.

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:12.858
The number one organ of ridicule,
nowadays, is the newspaper.

00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:15.071
If you open the newspaper
any day of the week,

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:17.411
it's full of people
who've messed up their lives.

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:20.428
They've slept with the wrong person,
taken the wrong substance,

00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:22.474
passed the wrong piece of legislation --

00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:24.666
whatever it is, and then
are fit for ridicule.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.975
In other words, they have failed.
And they are described as "losers."

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:29.827
Now, is there any alternative to this?

00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:34.447
I think the Western tradition shows us one
glorious alternative, which is tragedy.

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.693
Tragic art, as it developed
in the theaters of ancient Greece,

00:09:37.717 --> 00:09:40.487
in the fifth century B.C.,
was essentially an art form

00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:42.976
devoted to tracing how people fail,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.383
and also according them
a level of sympathy,

00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:50.683
which ordinary life would not
necessarily accord them.

00:09:50.707 --> 00:09:52.747
A few years ago,
I was thinking about this,

00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.366
and I went to "The Sunday Sport,"

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.000
a tabloid newspaper I don't
recommend you start reading

00:09:57.024 --> 00:09:58.921
if you're not familiar with it already.

00:09:58.945 --> 00:09:59.953
(Laughter)

00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:01.219
And I went to talk to them

00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:03.984
about certain of the great
tragedies of Western art.

00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:07.593
I wanted to see how they would seize
the bare bones of certain stories,

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:11.577
if they came in as a news item
at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.

00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:14.725
I mentioned Othello; they'd not
heard of it but were fascinated.

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:15.757
(Laughter)

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.083
I asked them to write
a headline for the story.

00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:21.546
They came up with "Love-Crazed
Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.976
Splashed across the headline.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:27.215
Again, a book they were
enchanted to discover.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:31.976
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress
Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.016
(Laughter)

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.223
And then my favorite --

00:10:34.247 --> 00:10:37.326
they really do have a kind of genius
of their own, these guys --

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.444
my favorite is Sophocles'
Oedipus the King:

00:10:39.468 --> 00:10:41.976
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.976
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.976
(Applause)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.976
In a way, if you like, at one end
of the spectrum of sympathy,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.793
you've got the tabloid newspaper.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:55.008
At the other end of the spectrum,
you've got tragedy and tragic art.

00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:57.806
And I suppose I'm arguing
that we should learn a little bit

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.616
about what's happening in tragic art.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.338
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.673
He is not a loser, though he has lost.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.334
And I think that is the message
of tragedy to us,

00:11:07.358 --> 00:11:09.976
and why it's so very,
very important, I think.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.976
The other thing about modern society
and why it causes this anxiety,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.976
is that we have nothing at its center
that is non-human.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.588
We are the first society
to be living in a world

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:22.104
where we don't worship
anything other than ourselves.

00:11:22.128 --> 00:11:24.573
We think very highly of ourselves,
and so we should;

00:11:24.597 --> 00:11:27.890
we've put people on the Moon,
done all sorts of extraordinary things.

00:11:27.914 --> 00:11:31.207
And so we tend to worship ourselves.
Our heroes are human heroes.

00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:32.794
That's a very new situation.

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.325
Most other societies have had,
right at their center,

00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:38.770
the worship of something transcendent:
a god, a spirit, a natural force,

00:11:38.794 --> 00:11:42.144
the universe, whatever it is --
something else that is being worshiped.

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.240
We've slightly lost
the habit of doing that,

00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:47.032
which is, I think, why we're
particularly drawn to nature.

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:50.312
Not for the sake of our health,
though it's often presented that way,

00:11:50.336 --> 00:11:52.976
but because it's an escape
from the human anthill.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.976
It's an escape from our own competition,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.976
and our own dramas.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.620
And that's why we enjoy looking
at glaciers and oceans,

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:03.595
and contemplating the Earth
from outside its perimeters, etc.

00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:07.198
We like to feel in contact
with something that is non-human,

00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:10.976
and that is so deeply important to us.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.191
What I think I've been talking
about really is success and failure.

00:12:14.215 --> 00:12:16.644
And one of the interesting
things about success

00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:18.652
is that we think we know what it means.

00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:22.073
If I said that there's somebody
behind the screen who's very successful,

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:24.474
certain ideas would
immediately come to mind.

00:12:24.498 --> 00:12:27.148
You'd think that person
might have made a lot of money,

00:12:27.172 --> 00:12:29.080
achieved renown in some field.

00:12:29.104 --> 00:12:30.433
My own theory of success --

00:12:30.457 --> 00:12:32.616
I'm somebody who's
very interested in success,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.121
I really want to be successful,

00:12:34.145 --> 00:12:36.327
always thinking,
how can I be more successful?

00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:40.332
But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced
about what that word "success" might mean.

00:12:40.705 --> 00:12:42.919
Here's an insight
that I've had about success:

00:12:42.943 --> 00:12:44.824
You can't be successful at everything.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.111
We hear a lot of talk
about work-life balance.

00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.286
Nonsense.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.976
You can't have it all. You can't.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.475
So any vision of success
has to admit what it's losing out on,

00:12:54.499 --> 00:12:56.176
where the element of loss is.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.724
And I think any wise life will accept,

00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:02.524
as I say, that there is going to be
an element where we're not succeeding.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.556
And the thing about a successful life
is that a lot of the time,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.470
our ideas of what it would mean
to live successfully are not our own.

00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:11.209
They're sucked in from other people;

00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:14.837
chiefly, if you're a man, your father,
and if you're a woman, your mother.

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.226
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home
this message for about 80 years.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.757
No one's quite listening hard enough,
but I very much believe it's true.

00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:24.899
And we also suck in messages
from everything from the television,

00:13:24.923 --> 00:13:26.709
to advertising, to marketing, etc.

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:28.976
These are hugely powerful forces

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.976
that define what we want
and how we view ourselves.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.976
When we're told that banking
is a very respectable profession,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.976
a lot of us want to go into banking.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.334
When banking is no longer so respectable,
we lose interest in banking.

00:13:41.358 --> 00:13:44.416
We are highly open to suggestion.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.337
So what I want to argue for
is not that we should give up

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.976
on our ideas of success,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.191
but we should make sure
that they are our own.

00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:52.976
We should focus in on our ideas,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.731
and make sure that we own them;

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:58.176
that we are truly the authors
of our own ambitions.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.001
Because it's bad enough
not getting what you want,

00:14:01.025 --> 00:14:04.112
but it's even worse to have
an idea of what it is you want,

00:14:04.136 --> 00:14:06.176
and find out, at the end of the journey,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.364
that it isn't, in fact,
what you wanted all along.

00:14:09.388 --> 00:14:10.976
So, I'm going to end it there.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.976
But what I really want to stress is:
by all means, success, yes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.572
But let's accept the strangeness
of some of our ideas.

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:21.341
Let's probe away
at our notions of success.

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:24.976
Let's make sure our ideas of success
are truly our own.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.976
Thank you very much.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.284
(Applause)

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.515
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.

00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:49.976
But how do you reconcile this idea

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.770
of it being bad to think
of someone as a "loser,"

00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:57.632
with the idea that a lot of people like,
of seizing control of your life,

00:14:57.656 --> 00:15:00.561
and that a society that encourages that,

00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:02.976
perhaps has to have
some winners and losers?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.651
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think
it's merely the randomness

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:08.341
of the winning and losing process
that I want to stress,

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:11.976
because the emphasis nowadays is so much
on the justice of everything,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.001
and politicians always talk about justice.

00:15:14.025 --> 00:15:17.433
Now I'm a firm believer in justice,
I just think that it's impossible.

00:15:17.457 --> 00:15:21.060
So we should do everything
we can to pursue it,

00:15:21.084 --> 00:15:24.520
but we should always remember
that whoever is facing us,

00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:26.687
whatever has happened in their lives,

00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:28.976
there will be a strong
element of the haphazard.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.216
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.306
otherwise, it can get
quite claustrophobic.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.555
CA: I mean, do you believe
that you can combine

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.864
your kind of kinder,
gentler philosophy of work

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:40.976
with a successful economy?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.782
Or do you think that you can't,

00:15:42.806 --> 00:15:46.480
but it doesn't matter that much that we're
putting too much emphasis on that?

00:15:46.504 --> 00:15:47.976
AB: The nightmare thought

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.976
is that frightening people
is the best way to get work out of them,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.412
and that somehow
the crueler the environment,

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:57.801
the more people will rise
to the challenge.

00:15:57.825 --> 00:16:00.770
You want to think, who would you like
as your ideal dad?

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:03.976
And your ideal dad is somebody
who is tough but gentle.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.213
And it's a very hard line to make.

00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:09.976
We need fathers, as it were,
the exemplary father figures in society,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.423
avoiding the two extremes,

00:16:12.447 --> 00:16:15.976
which is the authoritarian
disciplinarian on the one hand,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.801
and on the other,
the lax, no-rules option.

00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:22.198
CA: Alain De Botton.

00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:23.977
AB: Thank you very much.

00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:29.888
(Applause)
