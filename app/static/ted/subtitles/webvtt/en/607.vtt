00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, this is 2009.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are anxious to celebrate this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on almost every aspect

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of Darwin and his life,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and how he changed our thinking.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I say almost every aspect,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because there is one aspect of this story

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which they have thrown no light on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and to talk about something else.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I'm going to talk about it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
very, very closely related.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
there's a chimp, there's a man;

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
they're astoundingly different,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
no resemblance at all.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about culture or psychology, or behavior.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
measurable physical differences.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They, that one,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is hairy and walking on four legs.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That one is a naked biped. Why?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I mean --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
there's a reason for that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If we changed so much, something must have happened.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What happened?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Everybody knew the answer.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They knew what happened.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
our ancestors went out onto the plain.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That explained everything.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
or to chase after animals,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or to free our hands for weapons.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we got so overheated in the chase

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Everybody knew that, for generations.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
at the accompanying microfauna

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And they weren't savanna species.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
fossilized pollen.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Shock, horror.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Some of it even came from lianas,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So we're left with a situation where

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we know that our earliest ancestors

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
were moving around on four legs in the trees,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is not something I've made up.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's not a minority theory.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Everybody agrees with it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and spoke to University College London.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
forget about it. It was wrong.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We've got to go back to square one and start again."

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You've got this beautiful paradigm.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You've believed it through generations.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Nobody has questioned it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And now it's whipped away from under you.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, we know the answer because

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Thomas S. Kuhn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
wrote a seminal treatise

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
about this back in 1962.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
He said what scientists do

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
when a paradigm fails

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
(Laughter)

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So they say, "Yes it's wrong,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but supposing it was right ..."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
(Laughter)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And the only other option open to them

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is to stop asking the questions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So that is what they have done now.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It's what we ought to be doing.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Aaron Filler from Harvard said,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And we just record what we see."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
He knew all about that kind of science.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And he called it hypothesis-free science.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And if you're going to say,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the irony of it is,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
There was one waiting in the wings.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It had been waiting there since 1960

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
said, "I think what happened,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
perhaps our ancestors

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
had a more aquatic existence

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for some of the time."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
He kept it to himself for 30 years.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You've exposed us to public ridicule!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You must never do that again."

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And at that time, it became set in stone:

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the aquatic theory should be dumped

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
with the UFOs and the yetis,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
as part of the lunatic fringe of science.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Well I don't think that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'd like to talk about just a handful

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
of what have been called the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
hallmarks of mankind,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the things that made us different from everybody else,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and all our relatives.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Let's look at our naked skin.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's obvious that most of the things we think about

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
could that be why we are naked?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I mean, look at the elephant.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So back in 1982 I said,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Peals of merry laughter!

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
have aquatic ancestors.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
because look at the sea otter.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But you can say

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that every animal that has become naked

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And take bipedality.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
are capable of walking on two legs,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
if they want to, for a short time.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
There is only one circumstance in which they

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
always, all of them, walk on two legs,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and that is when they are wading through water.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Do you think that's significant?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
David Attenborough thinks it's significant,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Look at the fat layer.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Why should it be there?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the fat that in most land mammals

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is deposited inside the body wall,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
has started to migrate to the outside,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
In the whale it's complete:

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We cannot avoid the suspicion

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that in our case it's started to happen.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
We have got skin lined with this layer.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's the only possible explanation of why humans,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
if they're very unlucky,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
can become grossly obese,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
The question of why we can speak.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We can speak.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
are the diving animals and the diving birds.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Trying to imagine a diver

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Try to imagine a gorilla

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
performing the same maneuver,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and you can see that, compared with gorilla,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and it is not lunatic fringe.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And the ironic thing about it is that

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they are not staving off the aquatic theory

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to protect a theory of their own,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which they've all agreed on, and they love.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There is nothing there.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
They are staving off the aquatic theory

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to protect a vacuum.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Laughter)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
(Applause)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
How do they react when I say these things?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
is, "But it was investigated.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
when Hardy put forward his article."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I don't believe it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
of any incident of that kind,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It's never been done.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I ask people sometimes, and they say,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
"I like the aquatic theory!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They say "Well ...

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And if you've got a scientific problem like that,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
you can't solve it by holding a head count,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
(Laughter)

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Some of them have come over.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Anybody else out there? Come on in.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
The water is lovely.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
(Applause)

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And now we've got to look to the future.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
That would be very sad.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The second thing that could happen

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is that some young genius will arrive,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and say, "I've found it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
No sign of that happening either.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I don't think there is a third option.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So the third thing that might happen is

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
a very beautiful thing.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
If you look back at the early years of the last century,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
between the believers in Mendel,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and the believers in Darwin.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It ended with a new synthesis:

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
blending together.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And I think the same thing will happen here.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You'll get a new synthesis.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
will be blended together.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And we can move forward from there,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and really get somewhere.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That would be a beautiful thing.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Laughter)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
what's holding it up?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I can tell you that in three words.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Academia says no.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
They decided in 1960,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And it's not easy to change their minds.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
The professional journals

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
won't touch it with a barge pole.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
The textbooks don't mention it.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
let alone look for a reason to it.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
won't touch it with a barge pole.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So we never hear the case put for it,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
except in jocular references

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to people on the lunatic fringe.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Somebody up there

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
is issuing the commandment,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And if you hope to make progress in this profession,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
because it will get in your way."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So I get the impression that some parts

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
of the scientific establishment

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
are morphing into a kind of priesthood.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But you know, that makes me feel good,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
because Richard Dawkins has told us

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
how to treat a priesthood.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Laughter)

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
all the excessive awe and reverence

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
it's been trained to receive."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Right. I'll go ahead with that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And secondly, he says,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I'll go along with that too.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:52.000
(Applause)
