00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Take a look at this picture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These African students are doing their homework

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because they don't have any electricity at home.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, I haven't met these particular students,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but I've met students like them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So here is the puzzle.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Why is it that Nelson has access

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for generating electric light in the home?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
when people can bring new technologies in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and make them available to someone like Nelson.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What kinds of rules?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The electric company in this nation

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
electricity at a very low, subsidized price --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to hook up many other users.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The president wanted to change this rule.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
rules where businesses earn a small profit,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The president has seen how those rules worked well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but ran into a firestorm of protest

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
from businesses and consumers

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
from letting the win-win solution help his country.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
how we can change rules.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that we can make practical,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and more choices to leaders --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who, in many countries, are also people.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
(Laughter)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a choice like giving the president the choice

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to raise prices on electricity,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
subsidized electric power.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So if you give just to one side or the other,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
you'll have tension or friction.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that will give us a set of rules

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
for changing rules that get us out of traps.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And he says that if you want to see

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the damaging effects of rules,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In particular check out Asia.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
If you zoom in here,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
you can see North Korea, in outline here,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now, you won't be surprised to learn

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that the rules in North Korea

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
keep people there in the dark.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But it is important to recognize

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that North Korea and South Korea

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
started out with identical sets of rules

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in both the sense of laws and regulations,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but also in the deeper senses of understandings,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
norms, culture, values and beliefs.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When they separated, they made choices

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that led to very divergent paths

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for their sets of rules.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that we use to interact with each other,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
for better, or for worse.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Zoom in on Haiti,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in outline here.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Haiti is also dark,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
which has about the same number of residents.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
which has half as many residents

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
What Haiti warns us is that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
rules can be bad because governments are weak.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It's not just that the rules are bad because

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we can't just tear down.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Now, China dramatically demonstrates

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
both the potential and the challenges

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of working with rules.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
China was the world's high-technology leader.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And they soon adopted rules which

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
slowed down innovation

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and cut China off from the rest of the world.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So as other countries in the world innovated,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in the sense both of developing

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
newer technologies,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but also developing newer rules,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the Chinese were cut off from those advances.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Income there stayed stagnant,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This next chart looks at more recent data.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It plots income, average income in China

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
as a percentage of average income in the United States.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But then in the late '70s something changed.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
very quickly with the United States.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The brightest spot in China,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is Hong Kong.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Hong Kong was a small bit of China

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that, for most of the 20th century,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
operated under a very different set of rules

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
than the rest of mainland China --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
rules that were copied

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from working market economies of the time,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and administered by the British.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
millions of people could go, from the mainland,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But, to get on a process of increasing income,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
increasing skills

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
led to very rapid growth there.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Hong Kong was also the model

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
which leaders like Deng Xiaoping

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
could copy, when they decided to move

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
all of the mainland towards the market model.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the importance of offering choices to his people.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So instead of forcing everyone in China

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to shift immediately to the market model,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
they proceeded by creating some special zones

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
zones where Chinese could come and work,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and cities grew up very rapidly there;

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
also zones where foreign firms could come in

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and make things.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that made the iPhone that many of you have,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and they made it with labor from Chinese

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
who moved there to Shenzhen.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So after the four special zones,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
there were 14 coastal cites

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that were open in the same sense,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and eventually demonstrated successes

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
in these places that people could opt in to,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
One is: preserve choices for people.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Two: operate on the right scale.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but a village would be too small

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
all working under good rules.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
On the other hand, the nation is too big.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
If you try to change the rules in the nation,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
you can't give some people a chance

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to hold back, see how things turn out,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But cities give you this opportunity

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
to create new places,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
with new rules that people can opt in to.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And they're large enough

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to get all of the benefits that we can have

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
when millions of us work together under good rules.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So the proposal is that we

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
conceive of something called a charter city.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We start with a charter that specifies

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
all the rules required

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We'll need to attract the investors

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
who will build out the infrastructure --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
You'll need to attract firms,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
who will come hire the people who move there first.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And you'll need to attract families,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the residents who will come and live there permanently,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
raise their children, get an education for their children,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and get their first job.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
With that charter, people will move there.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The city can be built.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And we can scale this model.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
We can go do it over and over again.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Those are captured in the charter.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We also need the choices for people.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
That's really built into the model

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
if we allow for the possibility of building cities

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
on uninhabited land.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You start from uninhabited territory.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
People can come live under the new charter,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but no one is forced to live under it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
cases where nations work together,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
in effect, de facto,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the way China and Britain worked together

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and then scale it throughout China.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
through its actions in Hong Kong,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
did more to reduce world poverty

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
than all the aid programs that we've undertaken

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
in the last century.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to replicate this again,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
a delegation of control from one country to another

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now, when I say that,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
some of you are starting to think,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that come up when we start to think about these things,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
can get in the way, can make us pull back,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
can shut down our ability,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Why is this not like colonialism?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
The thing that was bad about colonialism,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is that it involved elements of

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
coercion and condescension.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
This model is all about choices,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It must have occurred to Castro

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that he has the chance to do for Cuba

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
what Deng Xiaoping did for China,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that has a very special status.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
where a treaty gives the United States

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
administrative responsibility

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They want to get out.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Why don't you, Canada, take over?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Build -- run a special administrative zone.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Allow a new city to be built up there.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Allow many people to come in.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Others will hold back. But this will be

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the gateway that will connect

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
the modern economy and the modern world

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
to my country."

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Now, where else might this model be tried?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that people can opt into as a rule.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It's a rule for changing rules.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They also totally get the idea that in some instances

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
the kind of investors who will come build the port,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
build the roads, in a new city --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
they can make more credible promises

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
if they do it along with a partner nation.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Perhaps even in some arrangement

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that's a little bit like an escrow account,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
where you put land in the escrow account

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
There is also lots of land in Africa

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
where new cities could be built.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
There are immense stretches of land like this --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Now, if we generalize this and think about

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
cities that will help create places for the

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
who will move to cities in the coming century --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is there enough land for them?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
like most of the world is already built out.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So let me show you why that's wrong.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Take this representation of all of the land.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Turn it into a square that stands for

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
all the arable land on Earth.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
by the cities that three billion people now live in.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
they would be dots like this.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
by building more cities that people can move to.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And if these are cities governed by good rules,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
safe from disease and bad sanitation,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
where people have a chance to get a job.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They can get basic utilities like electricity.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Their kids can get an education.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So what will it take to get started

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
building the first charter cities,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
scaling this so we build many more?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It would help to have a manual.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
(Laughter)

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
What university professors could do

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is write some details that might go into this manual.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
go out and design them.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
suppose it isn't just Canada

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
that does the deal with Raul Castro.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
How would we write the treaty to do that?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
How would we finance this?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
are cities that made huge gains

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You could use the gains on the value of the land

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
to pay for things like the police, the courts,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
but the school system and the health care system too,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
which make this a more attractive place to live,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and build it, and set up the basic rules,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
go very much in the right direction.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So there are many other details like this.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
How could we have buildings that are

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
low cost and affordable for people who work

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
but make those buildings energy efficient,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in an earthquake or a hurricane.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Many technical details to be worked out,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
can already tell that there is no roadblock,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
that will keep us from delivering on

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
a truly global win-win solution.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Let me conclude with this picture.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
The reason we can be so well off,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
even though there is so many people on earth,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
is because of the power of ideas.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We can share ideas with other people,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and when they discover them, they share with us.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's not like scarce objects,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
where sharing means we each get less.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
When we share ideas we all get more.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
When we think about ideas in that way,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
we usually think about technologies.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But there is another class of ideas:

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
rules like, let's have a tax system

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that supports a research university

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
that is registered in a government office,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
that people can pledge as collateral.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and particularly innovate in the sense

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
of coming up with rules for changing rules,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
so we don't get stuck with bad rules,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
then we can keep moving progress forward

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and truly make the world a better place,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
so that people like Nelson and his friends

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
(Applause)
