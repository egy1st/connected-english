00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
goes best with diseases of the small intestine.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in brief -- of this outbreak,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and particularly the kind of city that we live in today.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But I think the most important one is that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
London was this city of 2.5 million people,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But it was also the largest city that had ever been built.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so the Victorians were trying to live through

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and hope that it would somehow go away,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and of course it never really would go away.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
until literally their milk ran out and they died,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, you would just walk around London at this point

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and just be overwhelmed with this stench.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that was creating these diseases

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that would wipe through the city every three or four years.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And cholera was really the great killer of this period.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and throughout the U.K.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We had to get rid of the smell.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
founding public-health interventions in the system of the city,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
one of which was called the "Nuisances Act,"

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
which they got everybody as far as they could

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and -- oh right, we drink from the river.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So what ended up happening, actually,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So this was the state of London in 1854,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and in the midst of all this scientific confusion

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
about what was actually killing people,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
who was a local doctor in Soho in London,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
who had been arguing for about four or five years

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and had basically convinced nobody of this.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but nothing had really stuck.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And then on one day, August 28th of 1854,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
bordered on an extremely popular water pump,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And so this little girl inadvertently ended up

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
contaminating the water in this popular pump,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
erupted about two or three days later.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and much more would have died if people hadn't fled

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
after the initial outbreak kicked in.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So it was this incredibly terrifying event.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You had these scenes of entire families dying

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
over the course of 48 hours of cholera,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because he thought an outbreak that concentrated

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
could actually potentially end up convincing people that,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
He suspected an outbreak that concentrated

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
would probably involve a single point source.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
One single thing that everybody was going to

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
because it didn't have the traditional slower path

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of infections that you might expect.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so he went right in there and started interviewing people.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
who's kind of the other protagonist of the book --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
he knew everybody in the neighborhood.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And he managed to track down, Whitehead did,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And he thought about representing that

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but eventually he hit upon the idea

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that what he needed was something that you could see.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And so he created this map,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
as black bars at each address.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and you can see that one of the residences down the way

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
had about 15 people dead.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And the map is actually a little bit bigger.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
As you get further and further away from the pump,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And so you can see this something poisonous

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And so, with the help of this map,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and with the help of more evangelizing

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that he did over the next few years

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the authorities slowly started to come around.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And they had already started building the sewers in London,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and they immediately went to this outbreak

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and they told everybody to start boiling their water.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
it's a very dark story and it's a story

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
if we listen to the locals who understand

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
what's going on in these kinds of situations.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And what it ended up doing is making the idea

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in the space of seven days,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But because of what Snow did, because of this map,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
because of the whole series of reforms

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that happened in the wake of this map,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
cities like this one are in fact sustainable things.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
quite the way that, you know, Rome did,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.
