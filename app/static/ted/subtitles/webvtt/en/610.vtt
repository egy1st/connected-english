00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
doesn't mean it's not there."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I wanted to do is to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
show the world that the little things

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
can be the biggest things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We all seem to think that,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And we use the word "nothing."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My mother told me that, when I was a child,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that I should always respect the little things.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What made me do this work? I shall go into my story.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This all started when I was age five.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What made me do it? At school, I will admit this:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
academically, I couldn't express myself.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My world was seen as less.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I thought, I need to retreat

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
into something else.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So when my mother used to take me to school,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
she thought I was at school,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, the one time I was in the shed,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and my mother suspected something,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
thinking I was at school.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So you'd just see her feet.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So I was hiding in the shed, like that.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And all of a sudden ...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then I saw her legs.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and she lifted me up and she says,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"How come you're not at school?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I told her I couldn't face it because the way

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and using me as an example of failure.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I told her.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but I told her I didn't feel right.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And walked off. And I didn't expect that,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because I expected one of these ...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But I didn't get it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I'm sitting there thinking.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And as I looked down on the ground,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I noticed there was some ants running around.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I went into this little fantasy world.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I thought,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Or do they need somewhere to live?"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So I thought "Perhaps,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
if I made these ants some apartments,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they'll move in."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So I did.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
constructed this little apartment.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so they did.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And then I sat down and all the ants came along.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
(Laughter)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And from there I was watching this little world.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It became part of me.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
When I discovered that I had this gift,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I wanted to experiment with this world

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that we can't see.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So I realized that there was more to life

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
than just everything that we see around us that's huge.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
My mother told me to take it smaller.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Now I shall show you something here.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I'll explain.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
As you can see,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that's a pinhead.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Applause)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now that is called the Huf Haus.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The gentleman who commissioned me to do this

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
was a gentleman called Peter Huf.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Laughter)

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And then he said to me,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I says, "Well, try me."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So, to cut a long story short,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I went home, went underneath the microscope,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and I crushed up a piece of glass,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
crushed it up.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And underneath the microscope

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
there were splinters of glass.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Some of them were quite jagged.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So I was crushing up these pieces of glass,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
which, as you can see,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that's the actual frame of the house.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Laughter)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So I got the teddy bear and I said,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So I did.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So I decided to slice these up

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
with the tool that I make

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And then I actually

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
slow down my whole nervous system.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And then I work between my heartbeat,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I have one-and-a-half seconds

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to actually move.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
my own work, at the same time.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
(Applause)

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Because that has happened to me.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
(Laughter)

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I found these little bits of glass.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And I had to make them square.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And then I started rubbing, very very gently,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And how I constructed it,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And as I was doing it, what happened?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And it went like this ...

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And then that was it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Laughter)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Gone.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
when I told him his house has gone to another,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
into the atmosphere somewhere."

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So to cut the story short,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I decided that I had to go back and do it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
construct it very, very slowly,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
holding my breath, working between my heartbeat,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and making sure everything is leveled.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Because it's such a small sculpture,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
nothing can go wrong.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And I decided to build it up.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Then I used fibers out of my jumper,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which I held and stretched.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And made the beams going around the house.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And the actual windows and the balcony

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
had to be sort of constructed.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I used a money spider's web

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to actually attach certain things,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
which sent me insane.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But I managed to do it.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And when I finished it, I came back the next day.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I noticed that the house was occupied.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Have we ever heard of a dust mite?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Darren dust mite and his family moved in.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
(Laughter)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So basically I'd completed the house.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And there you are.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
(Applause)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Right. As you can see,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Bart Simpson is having a little argument.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
There's not enough room for the two of them.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I think he was just warning him actually.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But this one was made out of a nylon tag

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
out of my shirt.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
What I did, I plucked the tag out

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and put it underneath the microscope.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Audience: No.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
WW: So what I did is the same process where I

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
just kind of hold my breath

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and just work away very, very slowly,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Because it's on this molecular level things change

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and they act different.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And, you know, all different things happen.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to stop it moving.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Then static electricity set in.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And it went ...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So there is sweat dripping off my head,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And after I've cut out the shape,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So after I've done the same thing,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
then I have to paint it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And after I've actually sculpted them,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I have to paint them.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I experimented with a --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I found a dead fly.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Decided to make a paintbrush.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
(Laughter)

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But I would never do it to a living fly.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(Laughter)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Because I've heard a fly in pain.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And they go "Meow! Ow!"

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Even though they get on our nerves,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I would never kill an insect

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
because, "All creatures great and small" --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
there is a hymn that says that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So what I decided to do

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is to pluck fine hair out of my face.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That was the paintbrush.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And it starts to dry very quickly.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So I have to be very quick.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
If I'm not, it will end up looking

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
not like what it's supposed to look like.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So I have to be very very careful.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
This one took me approximately,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I would say, six to seven weeks.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
My work, rough estimate,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
sometimes five, six to seven weeks;

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
you can't always anticipate.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
(Applause)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
As you can see,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Laughter)

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
He says to me, "Willard" --

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You can see him saying, "Why me?"

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
That's just to show the scale

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and the actual size of the sculpture.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I would say it probably measures ...

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
a quarter of a millimeter.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
In America they say a period stop.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So say if you cut a period stop in half,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
which I took out of the air.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And what I normally do is walk 'round a room --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
(Laughter) --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And she saw me walking around like this.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
(Laughter)

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And then she looked at me.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And then I went ...

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yeah, to actually do this thing --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
the actual chariot is made of gold.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I had a 24-karat gold ring.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And I cut off a little flake of gold.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I bent it 'round,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and made it into the chariot.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And the horse is made from nylon.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
To get the symmetrical shape of the horse

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
was very difficult,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
because I had to get the horse to rear up

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and look as though it was in some kind of action.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
When I did this one,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
a gentleman seen it and said to me,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
There's no way a man can do that.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It must be a machine."

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Applause)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
That one took me approximately six weeks.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(Applause)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
The most famous statue in the world.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
This one, I would say,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
was a serious challenge.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:53.000
(Laughter)

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Because I had to put the torch on the top.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
That one is, more or less, the same type of process.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I used a microscopic shard of diamond

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to actually carve the actual base.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
because that statue has always sort of

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
kept an image in my head of, you know,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
the beginning of people coming to America.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And that's the first thing they saw.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So I wanted to have that little image.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And this is it.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
(Laughter)

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And we all know that is the Hulk.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Because we know we see needles,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
apart from putting a thread through it.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So I broke the needle.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And made a needle look like

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
the Hulk's broken it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
It's -- I had to make little holes

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So most of my work, I don't use glue.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
They go in with their own friction.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And that's how I managed to do it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And his mouth must be probably about

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
three microns.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
That ship there,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
that's made from 24-karat gold.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
because I couldn't get the web to move off.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Constructed each plank of gold.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
(Applause)

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
As you can see, dressage.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
(Laughter)

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
The actual rigging on the reins on the horse

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
are made from the same sort of thing.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And the pinhead I've made green around there

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
by scraping the particles off a green shirt

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and then pressed onto the needle.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
It's very painstaking work,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
but the best things come in small packages.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
(Laughter)

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan!

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
(Applause)
