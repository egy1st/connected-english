00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning everybody.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing is water.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that's been provided for you here at the conference,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
over the past couple of days.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But what if it wasn't?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What if it was from a source like this?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then statistics would actually say

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that half of you would now be suffering

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with diarrhea.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But they just don't seem to get through.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I think I've worked out why.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's because, using current thinking,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the scale of the problem

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
just seems too huge to contemplate solving.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we just switch off:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
us, governments and aid agencies.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, today, I'd like to show you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that through thinking differently,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the problem has been solved.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
By the way, since I've been speaking,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
another 13,000 people around the world

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
are suffering now with diarrhea.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And four children have just died.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I invented Lifesaver bottle

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because I got angry.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
when I was watching the devastating news

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
playing out on TV.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The days and weeks that followed,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
people fleeing to the hills,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
being forced to drink contaminated water

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
or face death.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That really stuck with me.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then, a few months later,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Day one: nothing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Day two: nothing.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
People were shooting each other on the streets

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for TV sets and water.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
That's when I decided I had to do something.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
However, after a few failed prototypes,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay, now for the science bit.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So a 200-nanometer bacteria

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The smallest virus, on the other hand,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
is about 25 nanometers.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So nothing is getting through.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Would you like to see that?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're in the fine city of Oxford.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So -- someone's done that up.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and got some water from the River Cherwell,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and the River Thames,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that flow through here. And this is the water.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But I got to thinking, you know,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
if we were in the middle of a flood zone

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And this is from my pond.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Okay. (Laughs) Right.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We're just going to pour that in there.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Audience: Ugh!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
from a sewage plant farm.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So I'm just going to put that in there.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Laughter)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Put that in there. There we go.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Laughter)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So we're just going to put that in there as well.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Okay. (Laughter) Now.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You just scoop the water up.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Today I'm going to use a jug

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Okay. There we go.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Replace the top.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Give it a few pumps. Okay?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That's all that's necessary.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now as soon as I pop the teat,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
sterile drinking water is going to come out.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
There we go. Mind the electrics.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That is safe, sterile drinking water.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
(Applause)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Cheers.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Applause)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
There you go Chris.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
(Applause)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
What's it taste of?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Chris Anderson: Delicious.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Michael Pritchard: Okay.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
(Laughter)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It'll last for 6,000 liters.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the system will shut off, protecting the user.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's good for another 6,000 liters.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So let's look at the applications.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We ship water.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Diseases spread. More resources are required.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But by thinking differently,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and shipping these,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
people can stay put.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
They can make their own sterile drinking water,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
for this to work.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and pipe work, is too expensive.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
When you run the numbers on a calculator,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
you run out of noughts.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So here is the "thinking different" bit.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Instead of shipping water,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and using man-made processes to do it,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
She picks the water up from there,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And where do people live? Near water.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
All we've go to do

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is make it sterile. How do we do that?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Or we could use one of these.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The same technology, in a jerry can.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
This will process 25,000 liters of water;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that's good enough for a family of four,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
for three years.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And how much does it cost?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
About half a cent a day to run.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Thank you.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
(Applause)

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, by thinking differently, and processing water

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
at the point of use,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to collect their water.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They can get it from a source nearby.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So with just eight billion dollars,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
we can hit the millennium goal's target

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
of halving the number of people

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
without access to safe drinking water.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
To put that into context,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
a year on foreign aid.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But why stop there?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So the three-and-a-half billion people

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that suffer every year as a result,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and the two million kids that die every year,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
will live.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Thank you.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Applause)
