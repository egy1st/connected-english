00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If I could reveal anything

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that is hidden from us,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at least in modern cultures,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we used to know

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as well as we knew our own names.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And that is that we live in a competent universe,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we are part of a brilliant planet,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and that we are surrounded by genius.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Biomimicry is a new discipline

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that tries to learn from those geniuses,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and take advice from them, design advice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's where I live,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and it's my university as well.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
remember the organisms and the ecosystems

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that know how to live here gracefully on this planet.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is what I would tell you to remember

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
if you ever forget this again.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Remember this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is what happens every year.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is what keeps its promise.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Spring.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Imagine designing spring.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Imagine that orchestration.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Imagine the timing, the coordination,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
all without top-down laws,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
or policies, or climate change protocols.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This happens every year.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There is lots of showing off.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
There is lots of love in the air.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
There's lots of grand openings.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the organisms, I promise you,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
have all of their priorities in order.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because he's living, usually on his back,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
looking up at those grasses.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And one time he came up to me --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And there was a wasp's nest

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that I had let grow in my yard,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
right outside my door.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And most people knock them down when they're small.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But it was fascinating to me,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And he came up to me and he knocked.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He would come every day with something to show me.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And he asked me

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
how I had made the house for those wasps,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
because he had never seen one this big.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And I told him, "You know, Cody,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the wasps actually made that."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we looked at it together.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I could see why he thought,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you know -- it was so beautifully done.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It was so architectural. It was so precise.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But it occurred to me, how in his small life

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
had he already believed the myth

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that if something was that well done,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that we must have done it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
How did he not know --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
it's what we've all forgotten --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that we're not the first ones to build.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We're not the first ones to process cellulose.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to try to optimize packing space,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We're not the first ones to build houses for our young.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is that people are beginning to remember

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that organisms, other organisms,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the rest of the natural world,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
are doing things very similar to what we need to do.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But in fact they are doing them in a way

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
for billions of years.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So these people, biomimics,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are nature's apprentices.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And they're focusing on function.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that they're learning.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They have asked themselves,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
"What if, every time I started to invent something,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And here is what they're learning.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
They're the people who make the bullet train.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It was called the bullet train

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
because it was rounded in front,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but every time it went into a tunnel

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
it would build up a pressure wave,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So the engineer's boss said,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"Find a way to quiet this train."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
He happened to be a birder.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the air, into another density of medium, water,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
without a splash. Look at this picture.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Without a splash, so they can see the fish.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And he thought, "What if we do this?"

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Quieted the train.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
How does nature repel bacteria?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
from some bacteria.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it's not because it goes fast.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It doesn't do it with a chemical.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that you had on Speedo bathing suits,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that broke all those records in the Olympics,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
but it's a particular kind of pattern.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
on its skin denticles

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to keep bacteria from landing,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
more people every year in the United States

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
about 100,000.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It has no fresh water that it's able to drink,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
but it drinks water out of fog.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And those bumps act like a magnet for water.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
who studied this, Andrew Parker.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
are starting to look at this as a way

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
of coating buildings

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
so that they gather water from the fog.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
CO2 as a building block.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Plants and organisms that make shells,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
coral, think of it as a building block.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There is now a cement manufacturing company

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
starting in the United States called Calera.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and they're using CO2 as a building block

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
in cement, in concrete.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Instead of -- cement usually

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now it's reversing that equation,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
thanks to the recipe from the coral.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
None of these are using the organisms.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
from the organisms.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
How does nature gather the sun's energy?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is a new kind of solar cell

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that's based on how a leaf works.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's self-assembling.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's extremely inexpensive

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and rechargeable every five years.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with Paul Hawken.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
There are many many ways that nature filters water

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that takes salt out of water.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
We take water and push it against a membrane.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and why it takes so much electricity.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Nature does something much more elegant.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And it's in every cell.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Every red blood cell of your body right now

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
has these hourglass-shaped pores

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
called aquaporins.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They actually export water molecules through.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's kind of a forward osmosis.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They export water molecules through,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and leave solutes on the other side.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
membranes mimicking this technology.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
along lines of stress.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This algorithm has been put into a software program

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that's now being used to make bridges lightweight,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to make building beams lightweight.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Actually G.M. Opel used it

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to create that skeleton you see,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in what's called their bionic car.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
as an organism must,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
for the maximum amount of strength.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
this beetle uses one material, chitin.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And it finds many many ways

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
to put many functions into it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's waterproof.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's strong and resilient.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
One of our major inventions

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that we need to be able to do

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
to come even close to what these organisms can do

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is to find a way

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and to add design to it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We use five polymers in the natural world

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
to do everything that you see.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
In our world we use about 350 polymers

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
to make all this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Nature is nano.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is that not many people have been asking,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Nature has been doing that for a long time.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
as part of their synthesis,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
they will emit, as a byproduct,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
nanoparticles into the water.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But then right after that, they emit a protein

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
so that they fall out of solution.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Energy use. Organisms sip energy,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And one of the largest fields right now,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in the world of energy grids,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
you hear about the smart grid.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
They are looking at how ants and bees

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
find their food and their flowers

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in the most effective way

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
as a whole hive.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And they're having appliances in your home

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
talk to one another through that algorithm,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and determine how to minimize peak power use.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
There's a group of scientists in Cornell

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that are making what they call a synthetic tree,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
It's capillary action and transpiration pulls

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
water up, a drop at a time,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
to move water up without pumps.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
some of these species --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
create 600 volts of electricity

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
with the chemicals that are in your body.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Even more interesting to me is that

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
600 volts doesn't fry it.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
with PVC for insulation.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
These organisms, how are they insulating

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
against their own electric charge?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These are some questions that we've yet to ask.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And those scalloped edges

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
play with flow in such a way

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that is reduces drag by 32 percent.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
MIT just has a new radio chip

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that uses far less power than our chips.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And it's based on the cochlear of your ear,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and radio signals, in the same chip.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Finally, on an ecosystem scale.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
we work with HOK Architects.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We're looking at building whole cities

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in their planning department.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And what we're saying is that,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
shouldn't our cities do at least as well,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
in terms of ecosystem services,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
as the native systems that they replace?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that hold cities to this higher bar.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
way to innovate.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Dr. Adam Neiman.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This is a depiction of

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
all of the water on Earth

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
in relation to the volume of the Earth --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water --

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And inside those balls

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
life, over 3.8 billion years,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
has made a lush, livable place for us.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And we are in a long, long line

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
of organisms

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to come to this planet and ask ourselves,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
How can we do what life has learned to do?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Now in order to do this, the design challenge

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
of our century, I think,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and to somehow meet them again.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I've been honored to work on

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
It's called AskNature.org.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
is to organize all biological information

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
by design and engineering function.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Ed Wilson's TED wish.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And he's gathering all biological information

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
on one website.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
"What can we learn from this organism?"

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And that information will go into AskNature.org.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
will be able, in the moment of creation,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and your own kidneys.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And we'll begin to

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
be able to

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
do as Cody does,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and actually be in touch

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
with these incredible models,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
these elders that have been here

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
far, far longer than we have.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And hopefully, with their help,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
we'll learn how to live on this Earth,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)
