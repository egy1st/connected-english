00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And I come from a long way.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
telling my story in form of a book.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And also telling it like now.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And also, the easiest one was

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
when I was doing it in form of a music.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So I have branded myself as a war child.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm doing this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because of an old lady in my village now,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who have lost her children.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There is no newspaper to cover her pain,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what she wants to change in this society.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I'm doing it for a young man

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because he can't write.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
YouTube, for them to talk.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
this painful stories out, the dreams I have,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that I have seen

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well I was born in the most difficult time,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
when my country was at war.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I saw my village burned down.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
vanish in my face.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
My mother was claimed by the war.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
My brothers and sisters were scattered.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And up to now, me and my father

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
were detached and I still have issues with him.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Seeing people die every day,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
my mother crying,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's like I was raised in a violence.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And that made me call myself a war child.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And not only that, when I was eight

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I became a child soldier.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I didn't know what was the war for.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But one thing I knew

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
When I went to the training camp I say,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
"I want to kill as many Muslims,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and as many Arabs, as possible."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because I wanted to revenge for my family.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I wanted to revenge for my village.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Luckily now things have changed

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because I came to discover the truth.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
wasn't the Arabs.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
which is the oil, the diamond,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the gold and the land.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
should I continue to hate, or let it go?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
music with the Muslims. I dance with them.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I even had a movie out called "War Child,"

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
funded by Muslim people.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So that pain has gone out.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But my story is huge.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So I'm just going to go into a different step now,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
which is easier for me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm going to give you poem

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
called "Forced to Sin,"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which is from my album "War Child."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I talk about my story.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
One of the journey that I tread

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and we were like around 400.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And only 16 people survived that journey.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So I hope you're going to hear this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
My dreams are like torment.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
My every moment.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Friends like Lual who died by my side,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of starvation.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of my comrade,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
he gave me comfort.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We used to raid villages,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
anything we could eat.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And therefore I was forced to sin,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
forced to sin to make a living,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
forced to sin to make a living.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Never give up. Never give in.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Left home at the age of seven.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Slept with one eye open wide.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Run, duck, play dead and hide.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I've seen my people die like flies.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But I've never seen a dead body,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at least one that I've killed.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
As a child so young and tender,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Words I can't forget I still remember.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I saw sergeant command raising his hand,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
no retreat, no surrender.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I carry the banner of the trauma.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
War child, child without a mama,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
still fighting in the saga.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I'm on a fight, day and night.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's like I'm living a dream.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
First time I'm feeling like a human being.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Ah! The children of Darfur.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that I'm fighting for.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Left home.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
My country is war-torn.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Ask God question, what am I here for.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And why are my people poor.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I was learning how to fight.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
snakes, and anything that had life.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I was ready to eat.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(Applause)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Thank you.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Applause)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I never saw anybody

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to tell my story to them

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
so they could advise me or do therapy.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So the music had been my therapy for me.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's been where I actually see heaven,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
where I can be happy,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So one thing I know about music:

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
music is the only thing that has power

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
to enter your cell system,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
your mind, your heart,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
influence your soul and your spirit,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and can even influence the way you live

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
without even you knowing.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Music is the only thing that can

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
make you want to wake up your bed

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and shake your leg,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
without even wanting to do it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And so the power music has

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I normally compare to the power love

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
when love doesn't see a color.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
One testimony about how I find music

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
is powerful is when

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I was still a soldier back then.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I hated the people in the north.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So we party and dance to their music.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And one thing that shocked me is one day

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they brought an Arab musician

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to come and entertain the soldiers.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But I had this question.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So what's happening here?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I've been in a painful journey.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Today is day number 233

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in which I only eat dinner.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I've done a campaign called

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Lose to Win.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Where I'm losing so that I could win

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the battle that I'm fighting now.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So my breakfast, my lunch,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I donate it to a charity that I founded

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
because we want to build a school in Sudan.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I'm doing this because also

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So in my village now, kids there,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and they are waiting to know,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
it means he got the money to build our school.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And so I made a commitment. I say,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but I've been humbled.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So it's taken me 232 days.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And I said, "No stop until we get it."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The people are giving three dollars.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Somebody donated 20 cents online.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I don't know how they did it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(Laughter)

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But that moved me.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And so, the importance of education to me

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
is what I'm willing to die for.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I'm willing to die for this,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
because I know what it can do to my people.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Education enlighten your brain,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
give you so many chances,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and you're able to survive.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
As a nation we have been crippled.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
For so many years we have fed on aid.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
families in a refugee camps.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So these people,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If anybody want to help us

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
this is what we need.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Invest in education.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Education so that we have strong institution

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that can create a revolution to change everything.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Because we have all those old men

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But if you invest in education

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
then we'll be able to change Africa.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
That's what I'm asking.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
(Applause)

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So in order to do that,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I founded a charter called Gua Africa,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
where we put kids in school.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And now we have a couple in university.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
That's what I want to do to change,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to make a difference in the world.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well now, my time is going,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
so I want to sing a song.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But I'll ask you guys to stand up

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
called Emma McCune

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that made it possible for me to be here.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm gonna sing this song,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
She came to my country and saw the importance

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
of education.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
She said the only way to help Sudan

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
is to invest in the women, educating them,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
educating the children,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
so that they could come and create a revolution

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
in this complex society.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So she even ended up marrying a commander

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
from the SPLA.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
One of them happened to be me now.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Audience: Yes!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Emmanuel Jal: All right.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
♫ This one goes to Emma McCune ♫

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000

♫ Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size ♫

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
♫ Just another little starving child ♫

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
♫ Running around in Africa, born to be wild ♫

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
♫ Praise God, praise the Almighty ♫

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
♫ for sending an angel to rescue me ♫

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
♫ I got a reason for being on this Earth ♫

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
♫ 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth ♫

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
♫ Now that I got a chance to stand my ground ♫

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
♫ I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds ♫

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
♫ I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon ♫

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
♫ And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune ♫

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
♫ Me! What would I be? Me! ♫

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000

♫ Yeah, Yeah! ♫

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
♫ I would have probably died from starvation ♫

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
♫ Just another refugee ♫

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
♫ I stand here because somebody cared ♫

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
♫ I stand here because somebody dared ♫

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
♫ I know there is a lot of Emmas out there ♫

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
♫ Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child ♫

♫ Another starving refugee ♫

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
♫ I remember the time when I was small ♫

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
♫ When I couldn't read or write at all ♫

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
♫ Now I'm all grown up, I got my education ♫

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
♫ The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one ♫

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
♫ How I prayed for this day to come ♫

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
♫ And I pray that the world find wisdom ♫

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
♫ To give the poor in need some assistance ♫

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
♫ Instead of putting up resistance, yeah ♫

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
♫ Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this ♫

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
♫ It ain't gonna happen ♫

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
♫ They're all sitting on they asses ♫

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
♫ Popping champagne and sponging off the masses ♫

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
♫ Coming from a refugee boy-soldier ♫

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
♫ But I still got my dignity ♫

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
♫ I gotta say it again ♫

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
♫ If Emma never rescued me ♫

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
♫ I'd be a corpse on the African plain ♫

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Is there anybody who's here in the back, some love.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Big scream for Emma everybody.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah! I'm gonna get crazy now.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
♫ What would I be? ♫

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
♫ If Emma never rescued me? ♫

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
♫ What would I be? ♫

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
♫ Another starving refugee ♫

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
♫ Yeah, Yeah ♫

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
♫ Yeah, I would have probably died from starvation ♫

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000

Thank you.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
(Applause)

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Go save a life of a child.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:45.000
(Applause)
