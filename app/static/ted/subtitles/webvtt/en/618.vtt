00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:03.658
I need to make a confession
at the outset here.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:08.435
A little over 20 years ago,
I did something that I regret,

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.182
something that I'm not
particularly proud of.

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.256
Something that, in many ways,
I wish no one would ever know,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.539
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:20.583
(Laughter)

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.864
In the late 1980s,

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:27.283
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:28.808
I went to law school.

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:30.770
(Laughter)

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.943
In America, law is a professional degree:

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.672
after your university degree,
you go on to law school.

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:40.136
When I got to law school,

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.270
I didn't do very well.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.504
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:48.535
I, in fact, graduated in the part
of my law school class

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.976
that made the top 90% possible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.222
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.048
Thank you.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.380
I never practiced law a day in my life;

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.388
I pretty much wasn't allowed to.

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:06.009
(Laughter)

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.631
But today, against my better judgment,

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.976
against the advice of my own wife,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.976
I want to try to dust off
some of those legal skills --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.359
what's left of those legal skills.

00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:21.129
I don't want to tell you a story.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.364
I want to make a case.

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:26.754
I want to make a hard-headed,

00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:27.976
evidence-based,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.174
dare I say lawyerly case,

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:33.947
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:37.778
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:39.245
take a look at this.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.576
This is called the candle problem.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.274
Some of you might know it.

00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:44.976
It's created in 1945

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.976
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.976
He created this experiment

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.131
that is used in many other experiments
in behavioral science.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.976
And here's how it works.
Suppose I'm the experimenter.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.620
I bring you into a room.

00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:00.868
I give you a candle,
some thumbtacks and some matches.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:01.963
And I say to you,

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.976
"Your job is to attach
the candle to the wall

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.126
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.685
Now what would you do?

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.304
Many people begin trying
to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:14.666
Doesn't work.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.420
I saw somebody
kind of make the motion over here --

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:22.548
some people have a great idea
where they light the match,

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:25.501
melt the side of the candle,
try to adhere it to the wall.

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:27.620
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.976
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
most people figure out the solution,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.745
which you can see here.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.559
The key is to overcome
what's called functional fixedness.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:42.547
You look at that box and you see it
only as a receptacle for the tacks.

00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.577
But it can also have this other function,

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.863
as a platform for the candle.

00:02:46.887 --> 00:02:47.976
The candle problem.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.971
I want to tell you about an experiment
using the candle problem,

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.454
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.599
who is now at Princeton University, US,

00:02:56.623 --> 00:02:59.976
This shows the power of incentives.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
He gathered his participants and said:

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.825
"I'm going to time you, how quickly
you can solve this problem."

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.325
To one group he said,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.976
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.541
averages for how long it typically takes
someone to solve this sort of problem."

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:16.976
To the second group he offered rewards.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.723
He said, "If you're in the top 25%
of the fastest times,

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:22.755
you get five dollars.

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:27.467
If you're the fastest of everyone
we're testing here today,

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.976
you get 20 dollars."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.883
Now this is several years ago,
adjusted for inflation,

00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.452
it's a decent sum of money
for a few minutes of work.

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:35.976
It's a nice motivator.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.143
Question:

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.484
How much faster did this group
solve the problem?

00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:42.623
Answer:

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:48.289
It took them, on average,
three and a half minutes longer.

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:49.528
3.5 min longer.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:51.374
This makes no sense, right?

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.501
I mean, I'm an American.
I believe in free markets.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.976
That's not how it's supposed
to work, right?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.184
(Laughter)

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:02.123
If you want people to perform better,
you reward them. Right?

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:04.976
Bonuses, commissions,
their own reality show.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.018
Incentivize them.

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.245
That's how business works.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.282
But that's not happening here.

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:12.976
You've got an incentive designed

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.796
to sharpen thinking
and accelerate creativity,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.976
and it does just the opposite.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.976
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.931
What's interesting about this experiment

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:25.525
is that it's not an aberration.

00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:28.634
This has been replicated
over and over again

00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:31.676
for nearly 40 years.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.976
These contingent motivators --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.374
if you do this, then you get that --

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:37.976
work in some circumstances.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.812
But for a lot of tasks,
they actually either don't work

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.732
or, often, they do harm.

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:49.577
This is one of the most robust findings
in social science,

00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:53.134
and also one of the most ignored.

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:54.748
I spent the last couple of years

00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:56.843
looking at the science
of human motivation,

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:59.229
particularly the dynamics
of extrinsic motivators

00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:00.976
and intrinsic motivators.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.412
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.774
If you look at the science,
there is a mismatch

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:07.651
between what science knows

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.086
and what business does.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.356
What's alarming here
is that our business operating system --

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.688
think of the set of assumptions
and protocols beneath our businesses,

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:19.421
how we motivate people,
how we apply our human resources--

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.700
it's built entirely
around these extrinsic motivators,

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.295
around carrots and sticks.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.508
That's actually fine for many kinds
of 20th century tasks.

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:31.643
But for 21st century tasks,

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:35.198
that mechanistic,
reward-and-punishment approach

00:05:35.222 --> 00:05:36.890
doesn't work,

00:05:36.914 --> 00:05:38.396
often doesn't work,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.591
and often does harm.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:40.798
Let me show you.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:43.899
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:46.536
he presented the problem
in a slightly different way,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.580
like this up here.

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:51.779
Attach the candle to the wall
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.279
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.745
You: we're incentivizing.

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:58.220
What happened this time?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.404
This time, the incentivized group
kicked the other group's butt.

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:06.443
Why?

00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:09.761
Because when the tacks are out of the box,

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:11.417
it's pretty easy isn't it?

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:15.711
(Laughter)

00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:20.713
If-then rewards work really well
for those sorts of tasks,

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:22.453
where there is a simple set of rules

00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:24.976
and a clear destination to go to.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.976
Rewards, by their very nature,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.976
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.335
that's why they work in so many cases.

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.438
So, for tasks like this,

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:36.815
a narrow focus, where you just see
the goal right there,

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.219
zoom straight ahead to it,

00:06:38.243 --> 00:06:39.872
they work really well.

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:42.616
But for the real candle problem,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.632
you don't want to be looking like this.

00:06:44.656 --> 00:06:47.786
The solution is on the periphery.
You want to be looking around.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.437
That reward actually narrows our focus

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:51.976
and restricts our possibility.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.970
Let me tell you why this is so important.

00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:58.279
In western Europe,

00:06:58.303 --> 00:06:59.388
in many parts of Asia,

00:06:59.412 --> 00:07:02.187
in North America, in Australia,

00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.777
white-collar workers are doing
less of this kind of work,

00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.181
and more of this kind of work.

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.836
That routine, rule-based,
left-brain work --

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.576
certain kinds of accounting,
financial analysis,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.295
computer programming --

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.514
has become fairly easy to outsource,

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:21.569
fairly easy to automate.

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:23.769
Software can do it faster.

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:26.118
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.110
So what really matters

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:33.762
are the more right-brained
creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.167
Think about your own work.

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.936
Think about your own work.

00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:40.455
Are the problems that you face,

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.976
or even the problems
we've been talking about here,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.888
do they have a clear set of rules,

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:47.499
and a single solution?

00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.976
No. The rules are mystifying.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.246
The solution, if it exists at all,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.976
is surprising and not obvious.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.754
Everybody in this room

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.976
is dealing with their own version
of the candle problem.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.137
And for candle problems of any kind,

00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:06.831
in any field,

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:09.848
those if-then rewards,

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:14.114
the things around which we've built
so many of our businesses,

00:08:14.138 --> 00:08:15.971
don't work!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.451
It makes me crazy.

00:08:18.475 --> 00:08:20.411
And here's the thing.

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:22.491
This is not a feeling.

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:26.790
Okay? I'm a lawyer;
I don't believe in feelings.

00:08:26.814 --> 00:08:30.457
This is not a philosophy.

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:32.743
I'm an American;
I don't believe in philosophy.

00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:34.454
(Laughter)

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:38.333
This is a fact --

00:08:38.357 --> 00:08:40.801
or, as we say in my hometown
of Washington, D.C.,

00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:42.415
a true fact.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.883
(Laughter)

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:48.701
(Applause)

00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:50.367
Let me give you an example.

00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.976
Let me marshal the evidence here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.113
I'm not telling a story,
I'm making a case.

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:56.408
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, some evidence:

00:08:56.432 --> 00:08:59.807
Dan Ariely, one of the great
economists of our time,

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.302
he and three colleagues
did a study of some MIT students.

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:05.976
They gave these MIT
students a bunch of games,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.976
games that involved creativity,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.278
and motor skills, and concentration.

00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:12.383
And the offered them, for performance,

00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:14.421
three levels of rewards:

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:18.691
small reward, medium reward,
large reward.

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:22.852
If you do really well
you get the large reward, on down.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.210
What happened?

00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:26.976
As long as the task
involved only mechanical skill

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.976
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.697
the higher the pay,
the better the performance.

00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:33.872
Okay?

00:09:33.896 --> 00:09:38.976
But once the task called
for even rudimentary cognitive skill,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.072
a larger reward led to poorer performance.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:46.246
Then they said,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.405
"Let's see if there's any
cultural bias here.

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:50.382
Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."

00:09:50.406 --> 00:09:51.976
Standard of living is lower.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.477
In Madurai, a reward that is modest
in North American standards,

00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:56.842
is more meaningful there.

00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:01.101
Same deal. A bunch of games,
three levels of rewards.

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:02.214
What happens?

00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:06.141
People offered the medium level of rewards

00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.745
did no better than people
offered the small rewards.

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:13.248
But this time,
people offered the highest rewards,

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:14.768
they did the worst of all.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:20.190
In eight of the nine tasks we examined
across three experiments,

00:10:20.214 --> 00:10:23.683
higher incentives led
to worse performance.

00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:31.450
Is this some kind of touchy-feely
socialist conspiracy going on here?

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.250
No, these are economists from MIT,

00:10:34.274 --> 00:10:36.976
from Carnegie Mellon,
from the University of Chicago.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.621
Do you know who sponsored this research?

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:43.765
The Federal Reserve Bank
of the United States.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:45.609
That's the American experience.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:48.408
Let's go across the pond
to the London School of Economics,

00:10:48.432 --> 00:10:50.976
LSE, London School of Economics,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.444
alma mater of eleven
Nobel Laureates in economics.

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.976
Training ground for great
economic thinkers

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.976
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.287
and Mick Jagger.

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.610
(Laughter)

00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:04.404
Last month,

00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:05.927
just last month,

00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:08.976
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.976
of pay-for-performance plans,
inside of companies.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.451
Here's what they said:

00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:15.271
"We find that financial incentives

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:19.348
can result in a negative impact
on overall performance."

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:24.475
There is a mismatch
between what science knows

00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:25.976
and what business does.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.277
And what worries me,
as we stand here in the rubble

00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:30.976
of the economic collapse,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.976
is that too many organizations
are making their decisions,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.372
their policies about talent and people,

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:41.523
based on assumptions that are outdated,

00:11:41.547 --> 00:11:42.737
unexamined,

00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.523
and rooted more in folklore
than in science.

00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:48.976
And if we really want to get
out of this economic mess,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.093
if we really want high performance

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:53.564
on those definitional tasks
of the 21st century,

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:59.528
the solution is not to do
more of the wrong things,

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.875
to entice people with a sweeter carrot,

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:04.298
or threaten them with a sharper stick.

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:05.976
We need a whole new approach.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.976
The good news is that the scientists

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.188
who've been studying motivation
have given us this new approach.

00:12:11.212 --> 00:12:14.307
It's built much more
around intrinsic motivation.

00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:16.786
Around the desire to do things
because they matter,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.373
because we like it, they're interesting,
or part of something important.

00:12:20.397 --> 00:12:23.976
And to my mind, that new operating
system for our businesses

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.701
revolves around three elements:

00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:28.976
autonomy, mastery and purpose.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.976
Autonomy: the urge
to direct our own lives.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.245
Mastery: the desire to get better
and better at something that matters.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:38.976
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.193
in the service of something
larger than ourselves.

00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:45.511
These are the building blocks
of an entirely new operating system

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:46.976
for our businesses.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.561
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.976
In the 20th century, we came up
with this idea of management.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.294
Management did not emanate from nature.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:59.976
Management is not a tree,
it's a television set.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.224
Somebody invented it.

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.248
It doesn't mean
it's going to work forever.

00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:06.279
Management is great.

00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:08.357
Traditional notions
of management are great

00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:09.976
if you want compliance.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.183
But if you want engagement,
self-direction works better.

00:13:13.207 --> 00:13:17.247
Some examples of some kind
of radical notions of self-direction.

00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:20.207
You don't see a lot of it,

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.707
but you see the first stirrings
of something really interesting going on,

00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:27.374
what it means is paying people adequately
and fairly, absolutely --

00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:29.683
getting the issue of money off the table,

00:13:29.707 --> 00:13:31.682
and then giving people lots of autonomy.

00:13:31.706 --> 00:13:32.976
Some examples.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.945
How many of you have heard
of the company Atlassian?

00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:38.976
It looks like less than half.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.405
(Laughter)

00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:44.976
Atlassian is an Australian
software company.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.971
And they do something incredibly cool.

00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:49.739
A few times a year
they tell their engineers,

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:53.769
"Go for the next 24 hours
and work on anything you want,

00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:55.903
as long as it's not part
of your regular job.

00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:57.317
Work on anything you want."

00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:01.104
Engineers use this time to come up
with a cool patch for code,

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:02.570
come up with an elegant hack.

00:14:02.594 --> 00:14:05.560
Then they present all of the stuff
that they've developed

00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:08.304
to their teammates,
to the rest of the company,

00:14:08.328 --> 00:14:12.280
in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting
at the end of the day.

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:14.499
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.

00:14:14.523 --> 00:14:16.543
They call them FedEx Days.

00:14:17.452 --> 00:14:18.481
Why?

00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:21.903
Because you have to deliver
something overnight.

00:14:22.817 --> 00:14:24.384
It's pretty; not bad.

00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:27.076
It's a huge trademark violation,
but it's pretty clever.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.437
(Laughter)

00:14:28.461 --> 00:14:30.139
That one day of intense autonomy

00:14:30.163 --> 00:14:32.215
has produced a whole array
of software fixes

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:33.976
that might never have existed.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.068
It's worked so well that Atlassian
has taken it to the next level

00:14:37.092 --> 00:14:38.150
with 20% time --

00:14:38.174 --> 00:14:40.342
done, famously, at Google --

00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:42.428
where engineers can spend
20% of their time

00:14:42.452 --> 00:14:44.397
working on anything they want.

00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:46.088
They have autonomy over their time,

00:14:46.112 --> 00:14:48.325
their task, their team, their technique.

00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:50.303
Radical amounts of autonomy.

00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:54.253
And at Google, as many of you know,

00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:56.610
about half of the new products
in a typical year

00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:59.110
are birthed during that 20% time:

00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:01.976
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.920
Let me give you an even more
radical example of it:

00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:08.817
something called the Results Only
Work Environment (the ROWE),

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.907
created by two American consultants,

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:13.610
in place at a dozen companies
around North America.

00:15:13.634 --> 00:15:16.239
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.215
They show up when they want.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:23.293
They don't have to be in the office
at a certain time, or any time.

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:25.262
They just have to get their work done.

00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:29.445
How they do it, when they do it,
where they do it, is totally up to them.

00:15:30.484 --> 00:15:33.815
Meetings in these kinds
of environments are optional.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.340
What happens?

00:15:36.364 --> 00:15:38.075
Almost across the board,

00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:41.309
productivity goes up,
worker engagement goes up,

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:44.976
worker satisfaction goes up,
turnover goes down.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.976
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.612
the building blocks
of a new way of doing things.

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.976
Some of you might look at this and say,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.460
"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."

00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:56.838
And I say, "Nope.

00:15:58.365 --> 00:15:59.933
I have proof."

00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:03.976
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started
an encyclopedia called Encarta.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.317
They had deployed
all the right incentives,

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.190
They paid professionals
to write and edit thousands of articles.

00:16:11.214 --> 00:16:13.803
Well-compensated managers
oversaw the whole thing

00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:16.085
to make sure it came in
on budget and on time.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.504
A few years later,
another encyclopedia got started.

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:21.925
Different model, right?

00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:25.006
Do it for fun.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.597
No one gets paid a cent,
or a euro or a yen.

00:16:29.096 --> 00:16:31.020
Do it because you like to do it.

00:16:31.044 --> 00:16:32.976
Just 10 years ago,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.249
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,

00:16:35.273 --> 00:16:38.848
"Hey, I've got these two different
models for creating an encyclopedia.

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:41.793
If they went head to head, who would win?"

00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:45.383
10 years ago you could not
have found a single sober economist

00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:47.627
anywhere on planet Earth

00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:50.523
who would have predicted
the Wikipedia model.

00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:53.246
This is the titanic battle
between these two approaches.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.338
This is the Ali-Frazier
of motivation, right?

00:16:56.362 --> 00:16:58.201
This is the Thrilla in Manila.

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:01.394
Intrinsic motivators
versus extrinsic motivators.

00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:02.976
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.557
versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?

00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:09.111
Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery
and purpose, in a knockout.

00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:10.135
Let me wrap up.

00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:15.826
There is a mismatch between
what science knows and what business does.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.437
Here is what science knows.

00:17:17.461 --> 00:17:19.144
One: Those 20th century rewards,

00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:22.148
those motivators we think
are a natural part of business,

00:17:22.172 --> 00:17:25.873
do work, but only in a surprisingly
narrow band of circumstances.

00:17:25.897 --> 00:17:30.690
Two: Those if-then rewards
often destroy creativity.

00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:34.514
Three: The secret to high performance
isn't rewards and punishments,

00:17:34.538 --> 00:17:36.148
but that unseen intrinsic drive--

00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:38.976
the drive to do things for their own sake.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.976
The drive to do things cause they matter.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.976
And here's the best part.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.220
We already know this.

00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:46.794
The science confirms
what we know in our hearts.

00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:51.648
So, if we repair this mismatch
between science and business,

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:54.605
if we bring our motivation,
notions of motivation

00:17:54.629 --> 00:17:56.356
into the 21st century,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.394
if we get past this lazy,
dangerous, ideology

00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:02.450
of carrots and sticks,

00:18:02.474 --> 00:18:05.203
we can strengthen our businesses,

00:18:05.227 --> 00:18:07.809
we can solve a lot
of those candle problems,

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:10.565
and maybe, maybe --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.753
we can change the world.

00:18:13.777 --> 00:18:15.082
