00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Early visions of wireless power

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
basically about 100 years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The thought that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
no one ever thought of that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so, in fact, he actually set about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
doing a variety of things.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
anywhere on Earth.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Federal Bureau of Investigation

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
took it down for security purposes,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sometime in the early 1900s.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But the one thing that did come out of electricity

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is that we love this stuff so much.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean, think about how much we love this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that have been invested in infrastructure around the world,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
putting up wires to get power from where it's created

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to where it's used.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The other thing is, we love batteries.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
there is something like 40 billion

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
disposable batteries built every year

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for power that, generally speaking,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is used within a few inches or a few feet

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of where there is very inexpensive power.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, before I got here,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I thought, "You know, I am from North America.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So I thought I'd better look it up first.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So definition number six is the North American

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
definition of the word "suck."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Wires suck, they really do.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or something under your desk.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The other thing is, batteries suck too.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And they really, really do.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
40 billion of these things built.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is what happens.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They fall apart, they disintegrate,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and they end up here.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So when you talk about expensive power,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the cost per kilowatt-hour

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to supply battery power to something

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Think about that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The most expensive grid power in the world

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is thousandths of that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So fortunately, one of the other definitions

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
of "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And nature really does abhor a vacuum.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What happened back a few years ago

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
at a distance of about two meters.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
by the way, that's still a couple thousand times

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But were able to light that,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and do it very successfully.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This was actually the experiment. So you can see

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the coils were somewhat larger.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
This all came from a professor

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
waking up at night to the third night in a row

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that his wife's cellphone was beeping

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because it was running out of battery power.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And he actually came up with this concept

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of resonant energy transfer.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and actually do transfer power

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
was separate the coils in a transformer

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to a greater distance than the size of those transformers

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
using this technology, which is not dissimilar

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's a resonant phenomenon

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which is nicknamed the Genius Award,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
last September, for his discovery.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So how does it work?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
there's a capacitor attached to it too.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And if you can cause that coil to resonate,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
what will happen is it will pulse

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
at alternating current frequencies --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
at a fairly high frequency, by the way.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And if you can bring another device

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
close enough to the source,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that will only work at exactly that frequency,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and transfer magnetic energy between them.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
turn it back into electricity,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and then you can use it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Number one question I get asked.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You know. What about safety?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It doesn't radiate.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It stays within either what we call the source,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
or within the device.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We live in a magnetic field.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that will regulate everything we do.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
They've pretty much set field exposure limits,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
sort of sit underneath those guidelines.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Mobile electronics.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Home electronics.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
has something that looks like that or those batteries.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There are industrial applications.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then finally, electric vehicles.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
These electric cars are beautiful.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But who is going to want to plug them in?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
where people don't have to die of infections anymore

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
if you can seal the thing up.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and show you, actually, how it works.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You've got a coil.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We put one on the back of the television set.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
There's lots of electronics and secret sauce

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It will cause one to get created

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
on the other side.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And if the demo gods are willing,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in about 10 seconds or so we should see it.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The 10 seconds actually are because we --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
when you use just a cord.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Generally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
we put a little computer in it that has to wake up

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to tell it to do that.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So, I'll plug that in.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It creates a magnetic field here.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It causes one to be created out here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
we should start to see ...

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
This is a commercially --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Applause)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
available color television set.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Imagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
How many people want to hang them on the wall?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Imagine if you can get rid of it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Almost immediately, though, people ask,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
was his wife's cellphone beeping.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, I wanted to show you something.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This a Google G1.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It runs the Android operating system.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's odd. It has a battery.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It also has coiled electronics

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that WiTricity has put into the back of it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And if I can get the camera --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
okay, great --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
you'll see, as I get sort of close...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Applause)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So we put a little sleeve on the back,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Applause)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And Nokia as well.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But they typically use it to light up the screen.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So that when you walk in or you come in from home,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And think of what that would do for you.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So I think in closing,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I thought I'd put up one more slide.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And for those of you who can't read it, it says,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So, thank you very much.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
(Applause)
