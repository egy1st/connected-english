00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
probably that's also a good choice.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to try and get out pen and paper

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So get out your pen and paper.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm just going to list some of them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There are 800 million people starving.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a billion people without clean drinking water.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Two billion people without sanitation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The lists go on and on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are many, many problems out there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We don't actually solve all problems.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which ones should we solve first?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And that's the question I'd like to ask you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to do good in this world, where should we spend it?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and I will just briefly read them:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
financial instability, governance and corruption,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
malnutrition and hunger, population migration,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We believe that these in many ways

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
encompass the biggest problems in the world.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The obvious question would be to ask,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
what do you think are the biggest things?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Where should we start on solving these problems?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But that's a wrong problem to ask.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Because we can't solve problems.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So the point is not to prioritize problems,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
To climate change that would be like Kyoto.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
an impossible task -- write down what you think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is probably some of the top priorities.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to put down what are the things we should not do, first.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What should be at the bottom of the list?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and just figure out what should be the top priorities

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to the world's biggest issues.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and that's actually what we did.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I also strongly encourage you,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to think about, how do we actually prioritize?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Of course, you have to ask yourself,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
why on Earth was such a list never done before?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Nobody wants to do this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
not to want to do such a list.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
yet we've never actually made a fundamental list

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
of all the big things that we can do in the world,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and said, which of them should we do first?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
as if we actually did the prioritization,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and went in and talked about it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
There are many, many things we can do out there,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We have not had an idea.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but you have no idea what the price is.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It could be a family-size pizza;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We'd like to know these things.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
to try to put prices on these issues.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
What can we do? What will be the cost

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and what will be the benefit of that?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Likewise in communicable diseases.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What would be the price?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And so on.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Then we had some of the world's top economists,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We called them the "dream team."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the Real Madrid of economics.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And then you ask, why economists?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because that's a very good question.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you ask a malaria expert.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That is what economists do.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They prioritize.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and which one should we do afterwards?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Of course, you can also see it on the website,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
They basically came up with a list where they said

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
there were bad projects -- basically, projects

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I'm going to go from backwards

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
so that we end up with the best projects.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
These were the bad projects.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
where people will say I shouldn't come back, either.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Why is it it came up?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And I'll actually also try to get back to this

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because it's probably one of the things

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is simply because it's very inefficient.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's not saying that global warming is not happening.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's not saying that it's not a big problem.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But it's saying that what we can do about it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is very little, at a very high cost.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
That's a substantial amount of money.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That's two to three times the global development aid

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that we give the Third World every year.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Yet it would do very little good.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Which is a little good, but not very much good.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And just to give you a sense of reference,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
for about 75 billion dollars a year,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
we could solve all major basic problems in the world.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and education to every single human being on the planet.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
on doing very little good?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And that is really why it becomes a bad project.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Again, what it tells us is suddenly

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
we start thinking about both sides of the equation.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So I'd like to show you the top four priorities

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
which should be at least the first ones that we deal with

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
every year for affected nations.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
we could bring that incidence down to half.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
getting infected every year.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We would significantly increase their ability

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This third best one was free trade.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
we could basically enliven the global economy

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
half of which would accrue to the Third World.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
two to three hundred million people out of poverty,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
very radically fast, in about two to five years.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
That would be the third best thing we could do.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
If we invest about 12 billion dollars,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we could make a severe inroad into that problem.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
That would be the second best investment that we could do.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
by investing in prevention.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Basically for the amount of money that we spend,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
we can do X amount of good in treatment,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and 10 times as much good in prevention.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
at first rate.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
did you get it right?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
We should also do climate change,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
But of course, we don't do all problems.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
There are many problems out there in the world.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that we focus on the right ones.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
people will be much, much richer.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
will be about as rich as we are today.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And of course, we'll be even richer than that.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And so the real point, of course, is to say,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
about helping me a little bit through climate change,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and who needed the help so much more?"

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So I think that really does tell us why it is

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we need to get our priorities straight.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It's a good film in the sense that

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and the whole discussion of priorities

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
as a defense for boring problems.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's not about making things that have the most media attention,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The other objections, I think, that are important to say,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Of course, we should do all things,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I think we should do all things, but we don't.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Since then our aid has halved.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
of suddenly solving all big problems.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I'm all for that.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But the point, of course, is still to say,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
if you get another 100 billion dollars,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and think about what are the right priorities.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
You know, when you ask the world's best economists,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And they're not necessarily, you know,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
great ways of looking at the entire world.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to come and solve the same problem.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and they spoke English.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
They had all the same material but they could go vastly

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
to come up with their own lists.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
with malnutrition and diseases at the top

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and climate change at the bottom.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We've done this many other times.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
They all come out with very much the same list.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and saying, what is the important thing in the world?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
We did it in 2004,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and we hope to assemble many more people,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
getting much better information for 2008, 2012.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Map out the right path for the world --

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
but also to start thinking about political triage.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
not the things that we don't know how to do,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
amount of good, at very low cost, right now."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
At the end of the day, you can disagree

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but we have to be honest and frank about saying,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If we worry too much about some things,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
we end by not worrying about other things.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So I hope this will help us make better priorities,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and think about how we better work for the world.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Thank you.
