00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to talk about your mindset.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I talk to my students about global issues,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I listen to them in the coffee break,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
they always talk about "we" and "them."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And when they come back into the lecture room

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"We learned it in college."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what is the definition then? "The definition?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Everyone knows," they say.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But then you know, I press them like this.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Western world is a long life in a small family.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Developing world is a short life in a large family."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I like that definition, because it enabled me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to transfer their mindset

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
into the dataset.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And here you have the dataset.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is size of family. One, two, three, four, five

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
children per woman on this axis.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And here, length of life, life expectancy,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
30, 40, 50.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And really this is about the bedroom.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you can live long.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
which had large families and short life. Developing world.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And we had one set of countries up there

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which was the western world.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They had small families and long life.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And you are going to see here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Then the developing countries applied

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
soap and water, vaccination.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And all the developing world started to apply family planning.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And partly to USA who help to provide

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
technical advice and investment.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and a life with 60 to 70 years.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But some countries remain back in this area here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We have Liberia. We have Congo.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So we have countries living there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So the problem I had

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is that the worldview that my students had

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
corresponds to reality in the world

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the year their teachers were born.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Applause)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I could see the wrong concept

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
even active people in United States had,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that they didn't realize the improvement

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Look here when I move them forward.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Here we go.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They catch up. There's Mexico.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There was less than five percent

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This great nation, Mexico,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has the problem that arms are coming from North,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
across the borders, so they had to stop that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But if I would change this axis here,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I would instead put income per person.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Income per person. I can put that here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And we will then see

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a completely different picture.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
By the way, I'm teaching you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
how to use our website, Gapminder World,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
while I'm correcting this,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because this is a free utility on the net.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And when I now finally got it right,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I can go back 200 years in history.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I can find United States up there.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I can let the other countries be shown.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And now I have income per person on this axis.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on par with Afghanistan today.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And what has happened in the world, I will show now.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is instead of studying history

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for one year at university.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Laughter)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and the yellow one, which is the United States,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
they get richer and richer and also

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
start to get healthier and healthier.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And this is now 100 years ago,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
where the rest of the world remains behind.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Here we come. And that was the influenza.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And then we come up. Not until

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
independence started.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Look here You have China over there,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
you have India over there,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and this is what has happened.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
but they are quite close.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And especially, it's interesting to see

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
China and the United States

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
during 200 years,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because I have my oldest son now working for Google,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
after Google acquired this software.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
for many years and developed this.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in China, he got a long-term perspective.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But in China they look generation after generation

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because they remember

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
when they went backwards.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then they would remember the first part

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
of last century, which was really bad,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But this was 1963.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
this amazing move forward.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Isn't it strange to see that the United States

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then also benefits of penicillin

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and vaccines and family planning.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And Asia could have social development

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
before they got the economic development.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So to me, as a public health professor,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Because what you see here, what you see here

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
isn't it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's not really, really flat.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But the middle income countries --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and this is where I suggest to my students,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
stop using the concept "developing world."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Because after all, talking about the developing world

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The last chapter is about present, and president Obama,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and the other is about the past,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
where you cover everything from Washington

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Eisenhower.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Because Washington to Eisenhower,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that is what we find in the developing world.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We could actually go to Mayflower

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to Eisenhower,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and that would be put together into a developing world,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
which have great entrepreneurs,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but also have the collapsing countries.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, how could we make better sense about this?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
look at income distribution.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
from $1. This is where you have food to eat.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
These people go to bed hungry.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And this is the number of people.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This is $10, whether you have a public or a private

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
health service system. This is where you can

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
provide health service for your family and school for your children,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and this is OECD countries:

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Green, Latin America, East Europe.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And this is how the world changed.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It changed like this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And it goes over here?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I come now, into projections,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that's where the projections are not valid any longer.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Probably the world will do this.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and then it will continue forward like this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But more or less, this is what will happen,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We have the high income countries here,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
with the United States as a leading power;

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
we have the emerging economies in the middle,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we have the low income countries here.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
they have been saving, you know, over the last decade.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And here we have the low income countries

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
where entrepreneurs are.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And here we have the countries in collapse and war,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We have all this at the same time.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the developing world.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because it's so different, what has happened there.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that's why I suggest

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
a slightly different approach of what you would call it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And you have huge differences within countries also.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I heard that your departments here were by regions.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
East Asia, Arab states,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And on this axis, GDP.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And on this, heath, child survival,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and it doesn't come as a surprise

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But when I split it, when I split it

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
into country bubbles,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the size of the bubbles here is the population.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Arab world.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now all your different departments.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We cannot put it into two parts.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
building, building countries.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And then it's United States today, up here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And we have countries all this way.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, this is the important thing

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of understanding how the world has changed.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
At this point I decided to make a pause.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
(Laughter)

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
for Demographic Health Survey.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
This is very serious.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
during 25 years of the very good methodology

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
for measuring child mortality

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
(Applause)

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And it is U.S. government at its best,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
without advocacy, providing facts,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that it's useful for the society.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And providing data free of charge

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Quite the opposite of the World Bank,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
who compiled data with government money,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
(Applause)

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But the people doing that at the World Bank

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
are among the best in the world.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And they are highly skilled professionals.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And when it comes to free data and transparency,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
United States of America is one of the best.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Laughter)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And I'm not paid to come here, no.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I would like to show you what happens with the data,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
what we can show with this data.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Look here. This is the world.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
With income down there and child mortality.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And what has happened in the world?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Since 1950, during the last 50 years

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we have had a fall in child mortality.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And we had an increase in income.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And the blue former developing countries

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as we have had, always, in history.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
about a completely new approach to do it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And how fast has this happened?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Well, MDG 4.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
The United States has not been so eager

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to use MDG 4.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Let's see what Sweden has done.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
We used to boast about fast social progress.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That's where we were, 1900.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
1900, Sweden was there.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
though they had lower income.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
They started very well. They used the aid well.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
They vaccinated the kids. They get better water.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And they reduced child mortality,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Second round, it's Sweden, 1916,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
against Egypt, 1990.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
They get safe water, they get food for the poor,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and they get malaria eradicated.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Brazil here has amazing social improvement

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
over the last 16 years,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and they go faster than Sweden.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
This means that the world is converging.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The middle income countries,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
the emerging economy, they are catching up.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
They are moving to cities,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
where they also get better assistance for that.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Well the Swedish students protest at this point.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
They say, "This is not fair,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that were not available for Sweden.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We have to do real-time competition."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It's the most tropical country in the world,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
a marshland on the equator.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But then they started to grow their economy.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And they made the social investment. They got away malaria.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They got a magnificent health system

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that beat both the U.S. and Sweden.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000
(Applause)

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
These yellow are just about to be doing this.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Not simplistic extrapolation.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We have to really find a way

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
of supporting those countries in a better way.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We have to respect the middle income countries

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
on what they are doing.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The blue is Africa.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
You see the tragedy in South Africa there.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And in spite of them having quite a high income,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
they have a huge number of HIV infected.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But you also see that there are African countries down here.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that has the same level as Sweden and United States.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And there are others who are extremely high.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And I will show you that what has happened

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
They have a very high level. It's coming down.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
But now it's not falling,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
because there, with help from PEPFAR,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And you can see it's not that easy,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that it is war which caused this.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Because here, in Congo, there is war.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And here, in Zambia, there is peace.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
If I split Tanzania in its income,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the richer 20 percent in Tanzania

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
has more HIV than the poorest one.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And it's really different within each country.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And this is the situation you see.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
probably of concurrent sexual partnership

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
among part of the heterosexual population

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
in some countries, or some parts of countries,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
in south and eastern Africa.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
in the way it can be done there.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So to just end up,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
there are things of suffering

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
in the one billion poorest, which we don't know.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Those who live beyond the cellphone,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
those who have yet to see a computer,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
those who have no electricity at home.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
This is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
elucidating in Africa.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It's similar to other nutritional diseases.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
It will never affect a rich person.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
We have seen it here in Mozambique.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
You never heard about the disease.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
But it's much more than Ebola

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
that has been affected by this disease.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Cause crippling throughout the world.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And over the last two years,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
2,000 people has been crippled

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
in the southern tip of Bandundu region.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
That used to be the illegal diamond trade,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That has now disappeared,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and they are now in great economic problem.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And one week ago, for the first time,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
there were four lines on the Internet.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and the great capacity

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
of people in the middle income countries

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and in peaceful low income countries.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
There is still mystery in one billion.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And we have to have more concepts

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
than just developing countries and developing world.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We need a new mindset. The world is converging,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
but -- but -- but not the bottom billion.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
They are still as poor as they've ever been.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But you will remain

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
one of the most important superpowers,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And this institution

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
will have a very crucial role,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
not for United States, but for the world.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So you have a very bad name,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
State Department. This is not the State Department.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It's the World Department.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
(Applause)
