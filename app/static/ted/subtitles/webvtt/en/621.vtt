00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love theater.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and look at life with a completely new perspective.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The idea that in that room at that moment,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
comes together.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
At that moment, we transcend space and time together.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and began developing "Upwake."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
he would have drawn three holes inside that box

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and told you your sheep was inside.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
from head to paper to screen to life.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Go from one world to another in a second.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and use metaphors to suggest ideas.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in high definition, live, on stage.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
between theater and technology.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Let's start with technology.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Fuse blowing)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
All right. Let's start with theater.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
(Laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Buzzing)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Click, click, bang)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Applause)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Thank you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which I interact with.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
what started as a one person show became a collaborative work

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
of nineteen most talented artists.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And here are some excerpts.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Applause)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Thank you.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And in Austin, Texas,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
in order to transport them into another.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Something happened along the way.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as it is about taking theater out of its box.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's as though you made something resonate within them.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
allows them to be themselves just a bit more.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Being human is an art form.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and I know theater can heal.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I know theater unites us.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
tell various stories through different mediums.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Comic books. Quantum physics video games.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And Zero wants to go to the moon.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
but it's important, and it's important to participate.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
There is a revolution.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It's a human and technological revolution.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It's motion and emotion.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's information.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It's happening.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The natural progression of science and art

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
There is a revolution in the way that we think,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
our evolution.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
when they needed it the most.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
In the science of today, we become artists.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
In the art of today, we become scientists.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We design our world. We invent possibilities.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
We teach, touch and move.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Ringing)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Thank you.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:14.000
(Applause)
