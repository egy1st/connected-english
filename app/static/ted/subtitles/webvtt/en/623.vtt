00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and how it can be solved.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to start with a little experiment.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or you've had laser refractive surgery?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that have some sort of vision correction.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The World Health Organization estimates --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the lowest estimate is 150 million people.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They also have an estimate of around a billion.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is around half of any population.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it's also an educational problem,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that we have in the developed world.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There are just way too few eye care professionals.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and that's the ratio in the U.K.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I came up with a solution to this problem,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and that solves the problem.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and I can see that guy running out there.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Next step in my process.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
... I've just ...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Applause)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In fact, this technology's been evolving.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I started working on it in 1985,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and it's been evolving very slowly.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
There are about 30,000 in use now.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I have a global vision for vision.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And that vision is to try to get a billion people

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The technology is being further developed --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the cost has to be brought down.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the cost has to be brought right down.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
who live on a dollar a day.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
How do you solve this problem?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You start to get into detail.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
How do you deal with the industry?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the answer to that is research.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
here in the university.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
